without knowing least cpu case current cooler temp cant really say best nhd15 good enough cpu thermalright phantom spirit would even cheaper similar performance air cooling
youre building new pc get aio existing pc get air cooler aios come fan usually wont buy additional fan
already sufficient cooler wouldnt waste 100 could go towards gpu upgrade really want swap tinker cpu guess would go artic one
post updated i5 12600k okinos cypress 7 case full 360mm aio support top front case well air cooler clearance 165mm height dimension nhd15
currently fan top pc aio would go fan come aio would go top radiator
air cooler barely sufficient start oc want definitely sufficient
5700x3d maxed cpu am4 cover gpu 4090 least
seeing u27b3m wonder would good option
ah multi time day question mixing kit shape form bad idea worst case scenario complete system boot failure
use brand size ram stick together mix match wont work somehow ram speed size slowestsmallest system also dont place right next leave one space free ram stick unless enough ram fill slot look motherboard manual confirmation usually closest cpu third cpu two ram stick tldr remove old 8gb stick replace new 16gb stick leave one slot free new one edit put new ram stick pc might take couple minute start first time ram stick trained first time everything start quick
alright thanks
alright thank
like asking oil put car providing absolutely detail automobile yes tomahawk lineup usually pretty good quality rbuildapcforme
ive edited post im panning get sorry xd
5600x 4090 seems pretty wide spread 100 cpu 1600 gpu depending resolutiongames cpu bound id look rbuildapcforme stickied post general idea part list
need new gpu today get one today reuse upgrade everything else
slowly buy upgrade part cant wait otherwise save
get gpu would prob 1080 kind due rest pc quite old example cpu intel core i76700 340 ghz still opinion would better replace gpu today
id say try get fe 5080 bad card youre upgrading directly 40 series
would go ahead get rtx 5080 youre playing 4k mentioned gpu power always help always upgrade motherboard cpu later
either significant 70ti best bang buck gb203 chip 5080 sm cut likely right next regular 4080
pcie50 wont matter base thing priceperformance
im waiting 5070ti tempted 5080 card vram
dilemma hopefully get 5080 tomorrow wait super version 24 gb
question 3080 running 10850k cpu people tell upgrade 5080 ready upgrade cpu going bottleneck 5080 granted cpu older something consider point planning waiting one generation ready complete rebuild pc
u may want consider potential tariff new administration ill buying card asap otherwise may end paying msrp 1000 5070ti
used 4070 ti super 4080s better play
1440p 100hz 5080 waste even 5070ti great degree aside gpu get new monitor worth
one want asking internet know one faster want spend speed
wait see rest card look like amd youre dying upgrade wait information
buy old 4080 4090 ur smart go amd
based benchmark 5000 series came id get newused 4090
thats really good point feel lackluster new 50 series u already 40 series dont wan na shell new gpu money 10 performance increase
go look 5080 review came today universally panned across board like guy said 4080s 4090 better choice
dont go amd actually care using rt dlss
looking xtx card ive never used newer gpu clue important ray tracing dlss 4080 4090 going 5080 msrp dont really want spend 1000 sure realistic getting ahold 999 5080
think totally depends play play marvel rival bit consistent 3 group 2 brother one brother 3060s amd one crazy unrelated network problem feel like driver lack devs testing thoroughly radeon card related situation might worth go nvidia lose rank get banned keep crashing albeit probably crash less 10 comp game still suck happen
might case 4080s cheaper except across europe 1179euro retail 5080 yet cheapest 4080s 1250euro minimum thats find one retail
reviewer fucking stupid reviewing single jump point 40 series card youre making leap older generation 5080 absolutely amazing value especially 4090s scalped shit theyre 3500 aud 4080 super make sense get 5080 200 super 1900 aud 5090 fucking insane 5000 aud especially ue dev suite moving forward id buy 5080 day week australia
review extremely biased dont take account multiframegen capability rtx 5000 series gpus separate number game performance figure make appear isnt major improvement vendor trying replicate nvidia people praising gross double standard power increase rtx 5000 series newer nvidia tensor core run ai model dlss frame generation
review dont take account massive improvement dlss4
5080 going going 5080 msrp anyway im kind boat probably going wait month see get whatever seems best value dust settle bit
pretty sure person referenced said get used one basically recommendation also
problem though latency based actual rendered frame let say playing game 40 fps 4k max setting sureyou turn dlss get 160 fpsbut response latency going feel little sluggish think certain title especially single player game wont matter tonbut anything competitiveyou arent going want dlss
showing review dlss would dishonest
legit reviewer going show result turned
guy used card lower retail especially 4000 series virtually happening
show figure without dlss show figure without ive seen deceitful omitting important relevant information
benchmark wont really show improvement extra cache cpuheavy sim game ive seen like 3050 improvement v like processor without
least 20 faster 5700x game productivity application game wont see performance increase might even see lower performance due reduced clock pure gaming best am4 cpu get since 5800x3d longer produced productivity might want consider non3d version 5900x5950x
httpsyoutubemujutrfanasikodkiy7ohbsgxby gaming 20 improvement non3d cpu
4090
price 5080 go leaf 4090 v 5090 would personally go 4090 interest mfg play 1440p uw
4090 dead stop lol 5080 4080 super 4x mfg lot glossymushy 2x native gameplay well youre losing lot
4090 5090 youll fine 4090 swing go 5090
5090 afford give better futureproof
5090 aorus master
4090 best option great year feel new line 5090 5080 great upgrade price
expensive 5090 since one get sell last
much used 4090 nowadays best place find someone please help
use 4090 friend til decide upgrade later cant argue free assuming theyre letting free anyone esle comment section would kill friend like 4090 spare theyre giving away free least cheaper
went 4090 setup 5080 review made feel much better choice got cheap cant justify upgrade 5090 right
go budget afford big boy buy cant afford convince never wanted first place overhyped nvidia massaged stats sure want afford like equally balanced argument bought one consumerism subjective
think 5090 price matter get 5090 get performance incress realy 5090 card run path traceing 4k maxed
dp21
thought new 4090 2000 friend selling 1500 want 4080s 1200 average 5080 1300 wonder multi frame gen important since im 240hz
future proofing doesnt matter 5090 owner keep playing game 4k maf setting weill need upgrade early anyways never buy 5090 keep longer 2 genrating next massive jump buy 6090 straight away
wouldnt even consider 5080 point honestly may also bias since 4090 logical step 5090
yeah dont want part like 8 year old getting new build 500 rough id take look bundle deal example microcenter available else used market probably best option look anything am4 even older like 35 year max office pc fine simply add gpu youre willing spend 600 id take look pcpartpickerhttpspcpartpickercomguide recommend entry level build theyre normally quite decent
run part build pcpartpicker come 900 wouldnt decent deal point part 8 year old may lot wearcould fail theyre obsolete purpose pc build scratch similar spec come 1k im sure option price point edit usedon craigstlist mention used market prbly best option indeed im searching
im expert according research 27 1440 look way better 32 pixel density real experience though couldnt tell
review generally saying 40 series worth upgrade coming 30 series lower worth upgrade imo 2060 5080 significant improvement think reviewer giving bad review theyre looking lens 4080 super 5080 jump im personally going upgrading 3060 ti 5080
make sense hard make sense noise old card lol one comparing mine new one obviously
5070 250 watt card 7700x 105 watt cpu long psu enough pcie connector fine
serious question 1440p 500hz 7800x3d 7900xtx game cant even reach 240 max hz new monitor 500 effectively untouchable number surely game simple one hit fps seems extremely overkill
would know longevity 5080 look like nvidia hitting plateau may see major improvement many year
whats wrong launch mean availability maybe
wait others expect nothing improved 5070 ti lower one compared 4000s
would buy 4070ti 4080 right used one gotten pretty nice price moment also new one bad happen get one still left
proclaim expert matter would go option 3 also really disappointed laughable launch 5xxx series gpus pricing far keep current 3080 4000 series high end gpus drop price
suck major difference performance cheapest 4080 super 1100 5080 1000 promised dont see wouldnt ok purchase fund
sound like youre really overthinking obviously dont get 5080 dont feel excited youre coming xbox series x 5080 along rest build fantastic uplift think biggest disappointment 5080 minimal generational uplift 4080s compared gpu starting 5080 great youre chasing higher fps going desire 500hz monitor dont think anything outside 5090 dlss frame gen going push near number modern game ray tracing course therell outlier also wouldnt hyper focus macrospercentages part represents cost overall build course good aware thing dont think deciding factor part purchase
doubt thing going improve much least super refresh year borrow 2070 might least worth finish system wait amd card release see theyre like personally dont high hope theyre 15 month away point wait
1440p gaming 5080 probably fine part 4k rt 16gb ram really struggle youre already point push get 5090 sure double price 5090 likely carry though next 45 year high end pc game 4k 1440p youll probably solid 67 year
wait amd gpus shake price prolly
fanboys downwoting dare
dont even know game could hope hit 500fps stable seems like chasing hz bigger number better get 5000 series isnt biggest uplift generation generation he literally coming xbox series x 5080 league better
know sweat running 4080 efficient gfx setting cap 480hz shooter lol would say there way eye seeing jump 240 480 significant way im old af
thats 1440p oled model coming year id fine 240hz lol new panel come better hdr brightness main reason
mostly vram skimping along iffy performance gain
10ish percent better 4080s 16gb vramfine already run indiana jones max fine card 1000 dollar card caveat like
lot better 4080
thanks response 500hx oled panel year happen 500 id fine 240 preferred fps 100 id still excited get build im someone hyperfixates benefit per dollar
suggest waiting part keeping current one ive gotten one listed far
people cant push pay double price maybe instance jumping 1000 2000 maybe comprehend youre type actually type
said double price cant afford
suggest returning part using build 2070s buy new gpu
conversation day dude mad getting 400fps minecraft deal 9800x3d 7900xt like fuck even happening game need speed go sit
im commenting monitor
youre building pc scratch budget already 25k part case mb cpu ram psu fan radiator 5080 pushing 35k 5090 30 total cost sure steep like total increased 100
hyper competitive minecraft pvp scene need fastest refresh rate highest frame order sit table
dont disagree number might say practical assuming price msrp wont bring country price itll even ridiculous 45k aud 2800usd minimum price rtx 5090 even american standard feasible fail see majority going rtx 5090 rtx 5080 underwhelming
would go way budget 5080 already pushing
thats case would suggest waiting see 5070 ti close 5080 save buck upgrade 240hz 1440p monitor set next 34 year resolution

wait 9070xt probably get 90 performance half price 5080
im curious people say im 2060 sold getting 5080 review morning im confused
gpu really dont know buy 7900xtx 5080 5090 5090 gon na month till save kind money
get used 4080 cheaper worth spending 5080 gain really bad unless want use fake frame higher latency
dlss
think good upgrade people complaining considering upgrading 30 series higher anything well worth especially get hand msrp imo
noticed frame used get game gotten worse reason csgo 2 instance used get 120fps get 90fps total war hammer 3 used get 150fps get 8090fps happening quality setting havent changed
theyre 12k usd im might well get new warrantied 5080 similar price
yeah point
dam thats 96405 send one haha
frame gen pretty cool people alwqys say fake frame blabla feel good 4000series card wich first framegen good
heard push dlss 4 4 series later
sure gpu correct power psu isnt supplying enough power though cable try higher wattage psu second remove ram clean socket try time different stick different socket one stick per time notice hang sound like faultyshitty gpu could gpu could ram died
tried one stick ram multiple ram socket socket absolutely clean new motherboard new cpu gpu 2 year old gpu work another computer dont think ram died boot another gpu
5700x3d double check compatible specific motherboard 12tb nvme ssd another kit ram total 32gb would give large bump performance without replacing everything klevv cras mp44l vp4300 lite much better value gaming wont notice difference performance time return ssd rm750x fine also upgrade
without country price impossible say good priceperformance wise putting build pcpartspicker would get feedback show best price resolution fps want game 7500f generally isnt much cheaper 7600 better cpu igpu useful troubleshooting slightly faster 100mhz still technically faster ddr5 3600 cl 30 ram would better price similar thermalright burst assassin 120 se cheaper better performing cooler

7700 xt best option httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388htmlhttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html
lol 6800xt hand even close rdna2 v rdna3 mean nothing nearing end support even mean fairly recent gpu 6800xt pretty much 7800xt whole class 7700xt spare extra 50 get 6800xt friend told better go 7700xt case either dont know talking purpose trying sabotage might want wait see performance price 9070 thats least 2 month away
tomshardware literally say 7700xt worse
dont know man first time trying build kept hearing major strong point nvidia amd support release driver ai stuff anyhow thanks bunch really inclining towards 6800xt
youre correct didnt see op listed 6800xt thinking 6800 reason still difference minimal 40 saving newer generation card
resolution going playing framerate targeting game
willing pay 40 mean wont need upgrade next 3 5 year ya think worth
since difference minimal saving 40 dollar would better since difference rdna 2 v rdna 3 negligible
2k coming cheap laptop anything 60 fine particular game really want play much new game
get 7700 xt 409 youre u would best deal overall priceperformance httpspcpartpickercomproductvtfmp6gigabytegamingocradeonrx7700xt12gbvideocardgvr77xtgamingoc12gdhttpspcpartpickercomproductvtfmp6gigabytegamingocradeonrx7700xt12gbvideocardgvr77xtgamingoc12gd
6800xt 1440p monitor great 2k wont regret getting power 40 7700xt 1440 doesnt give lot headroom coming year
sadly thanks anyway get point
youre right must needlessly worried arch stuff thanks bro youve great help
cpu powerful enough run literally gpu want 409050805090 powerful enough perform well
budget gpu country power supply
ok thank would good performance money worth new gen including
idk
really depends want spend honest there much stock 4000 series left could get 4080 super thats good value otherwise id wait till release new gen see price end
sorry cant help without answer question need info others said 14700f fine gpu get whatever want long power supply enough fit case open case look power supply get info
okay performance money worth say new gen gpu including
7900 xtx 7900 xt hard beat priceperformance least raw fps dont care nvidia feature like dlss better ray tracing
mean raw fps
get 360 fps fortnight cpu

thank look
yes gpus compatible motherboard pcie slot
thank
check gpus power requirement psu thats one component higherend card almost guaranteed push
ill make sure check pretty sure first got system went overkill psu ill check also make sure cpu wont mad
might mad itll work fine
9800x3d 3090 dlss 40 going breathe new life 3090 4k since performance ultra performance mode actually viable
yes good deal well done
depends would 130 new part germany meh deal guess bad amazing httpsdepcpartpickercomlistlbfr4s
saved 200 yeah thats pretty good im assuming work properly know check
used 2 month even better got receipt good deal imo also depends 7900xtx model guess
mean like youre likely able return used part whether struck gold youre pretty much stuck sure matter
id feel comfortable buying new since barely discounted used cpu gpu would feel great
ye work amazing
sapphire nitro 7900 xtx receips
good get dont dickhead
iam able
case friend struck gold nitro thats best 7900xtx get think nitro around 1050 euro eu 880 like someone mentioned especially 5080 flop 7900xtx even better value card run cool extra ocuv impressive performance uplift need tip lmk ill happy help reference got nitro last summer 650eur used year canadian market
recommendation cpu make sure youve got right cpu model ryzen 5 7600x thats solid pick gaming extra cash think upgrading ryzen 7 core cooling want better temp quieter setup consider getting better cpu cooler budget check keep eye total cost stay within 1700 budget especially youre thinking upgrade like cooler fancier cpu overall list look pretty good gaming budget tweaking cpu cooler could boost performance help last longer depending need much spend
check theyre worth selling ebay
heavily depends part gpus seem retain value resell market mobos ram etc typically arent worth effort unless youre scale market used cpu personally find risky dont want go hassle send back
ebay usually easiest ive selling used part therepretty much since started advised youre going lose 15 fee especially promote listing buyer also bit painintheass ive yet someone try scam return plenty people make last minute bid win auction minute later send message asking cancel sale placed bid see could win also really dont like moved payment system rather using paypal totally get past didnt pull money paypal return window closed inorder avoid classified bank ebay sends payout less fee almost immediately also aware benefit doubt buyer buyer protection naturally heavily biased towards issue buyer may whetherornot anything item youve sold customer buy used motherboard ddr2 expected able use ddr3 guess probably initiate return saying listing didnt reflect received youre going end eating shipping cost sometimes eating shipping cost return hopefully return theyll properly package sending back given shit happens sometimes send item customer decides return even legitimate reason get smashed usps youre probably going eat cost ship customer cost ship back getting payout usps insurance isnt easy insurance usps loses item even insurance everything worked customer one going usps filing claim lost item shipped chance theyll complain ebay ebay 100 refund pull right bank also buyer make really weird claim condition item classify feedback positive recourse get removed one guy say damaged usb port motherboard shipped know flat untrue positive feedback couldnt challenge thing surface tablet sold tempered glass screen protector five minute bought last moment took picture put sale got positive feedback said lied condition screen deep scratch right center positive feedback couldnt challenge really weird understand people anyway may sound like dont like selling ebay thats true part really good way get rid old part use additionally hardware sell lot may expect youve got hardware several generation old instance surprising market retro battlestations hardware still operating sold old ddr1 ram ago going sell much new course sold like 20 0 would gotten sent tech recycling previously planning
damn budget went woo
good know number one part replace gpu good know might recoup something

2080 would fine occasional gaming 4080 super still beast already unless plan using costco pc frequent 4k gaming without upscaling 2080 alright least try swapping 4080 super blowing bunch money 5080 also dont bother window 10 less year retirement
w10 placeholder ill use w11 gaming 4k costco pc 144hz im happy think ill save money swap
certainly worth trying always upgrade future
alredy fine ram save better gpu instead
im looking upgrade mostly mh wild also work pc ram also kinda cheap right
lol common cold
hear bird flu popular moment
try avoid getting flu good pc resistant serious note get best gpu afford going 14700f cpu probably getting least 4070 super new 5070 series better amd like 7900 gre xt better
may aswell try something exotic like covid sars common cold cheap cpu
already 14th gen intel cpu need illness
cpu fast enough pair gpu including 4090 really depends budget expectation 4070 super solid bet unless want performance wait nvidiaamd next gen release
get 9050 day nurse bruv
bird flu seems popular right
understand many people ask question many time day budget yes go preferred shopping site browse gpu sort price shop accordingly whatever fastest afford thats get
anything 5090 whatever budget psu allow
ive built couple pc im certainly expert dont flu necessary
meant gpu
thank would good performance money worth new gen included
go full linux definitely better ml game nowadays dont run linux many game actually run better linux window getting worse worse update
arent nvidia card poorlysupported linux
arc b580 much better gpu much much better
would huge upgrade get one msrp im sure state play right week ago selling way msrp availability poor basically meant rtx 4060 better choice similar performance price also issue b580 game need really powerful cpu get would push closer 4060 check video feature 5600 cpu give insight httpsyoutube00gmwhijujysi12xgcequmw6pz6ku
arguably speaking rtx3050 isnt worth buying b580 considered one best price performance gpus year yes worth rtx3050 8gb see average nearly 70 better rasterized performance
potential bottleneck cpu handle b580 old cpu couldnt handle rtx 3050 suffer bottleneck time
gpus little expensive msrp value b580 msrp 249 312 roughly 25 increase rtx4060 msrp 299 350 roughly 17 increase dont know whether wait dont know price ever go
noticed buying rtx 3050 good money could afford time 70 increase performance sound amazing thanks reassuring buying card
still technically bottlenecked bothering definitely get better gpu people rtx4070 gpus paired r55600 cpu arent complaining
dont think ive ever seen bottleneck current setup maybe minimal dont notice bottleneck hasnt bothering
part look pretty good 14900kf good gaming feature lot core thread making good workload well 7800xt also solid gpu balance pretty well cpu 32gb ram also good amount workload gaming thing might want consider intels 14th gen cpu sometimes face issue could cause application crash however might fixed im sure
thank response ig cpu problem ill able return
able sell price similiar msrp around 6 month release build u time machine maybe tell action opening box usually result value drop used card
get whatever available price make sense call day reevaluate road feel like overthink ready wont bother
knwos future brings btw based benchmark get 4080 super cheaper 5080
get flipping xtx
mean youre right hope people advice something experience previous generation
edited original comment
yeah im considering try get 5080 msrp fe prime fail probably go 4080s like said
probably wouldnt able tell difference two unless youre audiophile high quality studio monitor speaker headphone even likely minimal especially gaming front panel audio connector notoriously poor recommended best quality audio case usually subject electrical interference inside case made using lower quality connector wiring want highest audio quality get external sound card dacamp instead quality headphone speaker onboard sound great overall even compared moderately priced external option schiit fulla even cheap creative sound blasterx dirt cheap apple usb c headphone adapter dont need mic input
really much difference wouldnt sound weaker quieter interference fps game audio one important factor
likely depends headphone speaker audio chipset motherboard interference get static background andor lower volume especially using mic plugged front panel 4080 mag b650 tomahawk wifi would best decide go external audio could try front rear port see make difference case
im going use baseus gh02 24gh
dont use motherboard audio usb connection unless used wired make difference audio chipset motherboard
could explain doesnt make difference
using usb headset completely bypass mobo audio chipset dont use processing either done cpu combination cpu whatever chipset usb dongle onboard audio chipset onboard audio work headphone speaker plugged 35 mm rear front panel port audio connector motherboard rear io panel
damn thank much dont need worry anymore im going get asrock b650e pg riptide new technology good thanks

slot closest cpu talk directly cpu away port normally operate south bridge mean shared bandwidth could possibly slower however interesting thing make thing case m22 occupied m2 device pcie x161 run x8 mode pcie x163 slot share bandwidth pcie x12 pcie x13 expansion slot 2 x pcie 3020 x16 x16 x8x4 1 x pcie 20 x16 max x4 mode 1 im thinking trigger bifurcation might slow graphic card impact nvme speed

9800x3d best gaming cpu available 5080 top3 gpu behind 4090 5090
youre saying overkill
overkill performance number part go decide
purpose first comment wanted know part top 5 top 3 top 1 could google asked get human response opinion reasonable assumption comment youre indicating overkill mentioning one part best scene top 3
could someone help tell lacking something youre exactly asking definitive question working pc based formatted prebuilt theyre going give halfbuilt pc top 3 yeah price 1000 1600 2000 dont know cost germany wherever youre buying im gon na guess probably euro instead dollar sign top 3 gigantic spread price
youre exactly asking definitive question want general opinion well made pc obviously good part may overkill may underkill rtc yeah working pc based formatted prebuilt theyre going give halfbuilt pc could easily try sell expensive part dont necessarily need there reason almost everyone say build instead buying prebuilt yeah price difference 1000 1600 2000 dont know cost germany wherever youre buying im gon na guess probably euro instead dollar sign dont see relevant point making
could easily try sell expensive part dont necessarily need there reason almost everyone say build instead buying prebuilt literally asked spec good best gaming cpu top3 gpu dont know else want know playing 20 year old emulated game 720p yes massively overkill playing aaa game 4k 144hz maxed setting could spend even gpu provide detail expect go watch review 5080 9800x3d make decision
except im wondering good combination part cpu strong gpu power supply enough fan overkillunderkill etc thought obvious subtext considering would buy higher priced spec looking better pc sure sorry shouldve clear 5 year old could understand exactly looking
youre trying get 5080 launch day brand focused whichever one actually get able picky hell chance getting one get snapped bot scalper damn near zero want sure try nothing lose prepared disappointment power supply damn ive saying folk asking 750w plenty 5080 given 14700k eats power like fun yeah id probably upgrade youre u thermaltake gf3 tt 850w reasonable 90 would enough honestly 1000w unit 40 might grab
could bad motherboard experience power surge physically damage mobo anything else ordinary happen couldve damaged motherboard
fixed itnot really posted honestly dont know turned time nothing happened unscrewed gpu mount thing help sag decided give try commit disassembling everything low behold turned fixed problem usb connection thing cmos battery ig idk good thing worked ig
overall standard 5600 pretty good pairing 3060ti buddy us one 4070 super 1440p situation he still gpu limited said know play pretty heavy cpu title 5700x3d definitely best bet look like canadian pricing pretty terrible chip right taking quick look pcpp see 5700 nonx 190 cadhttpscapcpartpickercomproduct9nfmp6amdryzen7570037ghz8coreprocessor100000000743box think could good balanced option purpose
ngl experience aliexpress reliablelegit amazon there much difference 5600 5600x would faster 5600g likely difference isnt worth price save 5700x3d
benchmark find either focus 1080p gaming dont list many 5000series cpu im interested use 1080p often gpu isnt useful 1080p gaming force limitation cpu get result cpu limited way id look upgrade gpu later cpu end buying give increase performance point become cpu limited unless youre planning going hfr 120hz monitor near future youd upgrade past am4 would stick 5600g see enough used cpu tend get pretty cheap theyre among best socket could easily see 5700x dropping 100 usd used long could get upgrade simply use less
5700x3d best bet im 1440p 5700x yeah really doesnt make much sense since upgrade incremental however tangible result especially 1 low important play tekken 8 online lot surprisingly there also max fps increase re3 gpu 6750xt caveat emptor youre getting one ali seems like lot got szcpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfehlsappdshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqfehlsappds
thanks yeah feeling like missed 5700x3d train sure 5600g good 2025 worse 5600xt 1440p half l3 cache worry might want core line 56005600xt ive heard 5700 bit lemon cpu would perform worse 56005600xt thanks suggestion though

thanks advice im feeling fomo hard core 5700x3d scarce right tried using pbo curve optimizer 5600g already seeing gain applying undervolt gpu may well stick bide time might see good sale 5600x5700x future thanks
thanks link know wont see gain 3060ti 4090 vid yeah id love get 5700x3d im sketched ali express yeah szcpu nothing listed shop anymore thanks though
problem friend yikes sorry recommendation looked benchmark well definitely seems like let ive used 5600x 5700x3d 5700 5600x still good pick though
asus tuf board board pretty goo tier rest overpriced offer compared every brand
use asus honestly msi apparently really good stability term bios asrock aswell apparently really good havent heard much brand like asusbased uk warranty apparently better well local issue although little bit troubleshooting running really well
quality wise ive heard theyre ok ive heard bad thing getting problem resolved warranty least u got asus 4070 last year havent quality issue yet ended getting asrock board though since much cheaper like bios better
using asus tuf b650m plus wifi honestly really bad experience tried 3 different set ram always seemed trouble ram compatibility would randomly power cycle sometimes get stuck training ram white power cycling without expo turned updated bios cleared cmos many many time kind nightmare tbh switched gigabyte b850m motherboard far havent problem ymmv anecdotally really bad experience asus b650m
u
yes get b650 gaming plus
since asus motherboards bad pick manufacturer develop sell like asus talking eu maybe situation different country
x870ee great month much experience mobos though cant meaningfully comment improvement although seems work reliably big improvement anecdotal evidence
ok thing first assuming youre referring cpu burning issue issue youre referring wasnt asus amd wasnt conservative enough maximum voltage 7800x3d motherboard manufacturer thought amd conservative allowed even voltage flow cpu fairness asus worst particular issue allowed overvoltage flow response problem far worst manufacturer literally motherboard manufacturer got problem asus poor public response commonly referred asus burning cpu issue drive slightly nut asus deserves fair amount shit way handle rmas dont really deserve thought primary driver particular problem background aside hasnt thing like almost two year even pretty short thing issue even issue x3d cpu sure update bios get everything upandrunning youll fine really isnt critical even x3d cpu likelihood bios hasnt updated fix overvoltage pretty low even extremely unlikely event got motherboard bios two year old x3d cpu issue initial powerup setup need via bios flashback make sure bios update first thing get bios screen youll fine
eu europe
think people refer rma issue u agree build quality good
current asus awesome company used quality customer service gone way people dont actually know continue buy asus brand loyalty asrock founded exasus employee back asus glory day found started buying asrock mobos issue yet cpuram compatibility customer service great
thanks lot input ive reading issue around x3d pcpartpicker upgrade bios everything okay thanks

looking hero knowing cant overclock 7800x3d knowing setup issue idk talking

part work
good information something thinking assumed hard dive window ssd game would transfer unfortunately prebuilt window already installed dont recall ever getting recoveryactivation code
depends price country likely overpriced compared building similar system scratch thats downside buying pre custombuilt system instead building fine though dont knowledge build one ok lower moderate 1080p least 7600 xt gpu weak point build want 1440p least 7800 xt would recommended also significantly expensive compare gpu performance chart httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388htmlhttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html
wait review decide one make valuation 5070 right one one allowed talk yet 5080 anything go 5070 extremely underwhelming
question think worth would waste money know got ta wait come less 24 hour see benchmark exactly got ta wait probably another month 5070 release benchmark 5070ti release 20th february 5070 doesnt confirmed release date youll wait would probably try get 16gb vram gpu 1440p
benchmark bro whoop didnt realise meant 5070 lol
3080 id chillin got 7800xt im still fuckin chillin
doom borderland game arent known gpu demanding dont think worth 1440p
bro one pc still 1070
care high end considering 5070 ive seen review 4080 xtx practically neck neck unless talking pt dont think 5070 also 9070xt around 7900xt performance raster faster xtx rt likely close hell game 4090 xtx equal
play 4k 3080 10gb definitely wouldnt upgrade 5070 5070ti 5080 maybe 5070 likely around 4070 super ai feature
sticking 3080 least refresh next year going cpu upgrade year going 9800 x3d 10700k help card age little better
benchmark get released bad feeling similar performance 3080
getting harder harder recommend 12 gb vram card time go want upgrade sustenance long run get minimum 16gb vram card game already throttled 12 gb especially high rt title going get worse
get 408p super 7900 xtx instead care budget cause 5080 4080 super difference 11
likely proprietary non atx standard motherboard may header thats risk take prebuilt systemmotherboard fairly obvious connector could post high re well lit focused pic imgur mobo link might able tell sure least tell u exact model motherboard printed right
original case still might reverse engineer front panel header figure pin dont see usb c header though leave unplugged
omen 25l motherboard doesnt direct usbc header previous chassis usbc frontport likely using usb3 front panel type c adapterhttpswwwamazoncomlinkupmotherboardkeyconstructiondurabilitydpb0cfg9kg74 frontpanel connector theyre standard plug one bit tougher look omen 25l motherboard picture could find power switch header found twopin connector series next cmos reset jumper get clear high resolution picture motherboard post imgur probably find
doesnt one theyre proprietary board case usb c back io
im new pc might stupid question adapter something put fpanel connecter fan sata socket
usb c back io
far know called hp blizzardl motherboard
think called blizzardl
im trying front io cable go box thats stuck side case wont open
fpanel connector turning everything
thats figured
looking like youre going need standard atx mobo replacement unless least figure front panel power switch header pin get turned
thats fine need end multimeter
first verify youre currently using almost 16 gb gaming running program adding ram make difference performance upgrade keeping 2x16 gb stick likely work since mobos struggle run ram rated speed 4 slot full especially without manually overclocking using xmp mixing matching different ram stick also lead issue instability
potentially need far information give definitive answer full system spec whats rank configuration kit singlerank dualrank two kit identical timing
run setup 5700x3d issue make sure timing identical
theory fine expandability id recommend single stick 8 16 32 mine
dont want ram gaming 16 gb obviously enough interested running llm computer run relatively small one amount ram research instability issue thanks
4 stick isnt much problem ddr4 ddr5 suffers 4 stick
running ryzen 7 5700x gtx 1660 super buy new one hopefully soon sure single rank dual rank mean could please clarify yes 3600 mhz kit
perfect running ryzen 7 5700x thanks feedback
single stick want matching pair dual channel
assume gaming unless stated otherwise since majority user 48 gb would fine get stable speed may less issue productivity task compared gaming depends certainly install 4 stick try make sure keep matching pair matching channel
yes 3600 mhz kit 3600 mt run 1800 mhz timing transfer rate though spec probably list timing profile like 18222242 similar exact dimms looking buying full spec sure single rank dual rank mean could please clarify dimms physically arranged either singlerank dualrank actual memory chip connected something called chip select line rank per channel improves performance allowing something called interleaving rank harder run memory rank specification module manufacturer dont specify multiple skus one type kit corsair notorious lpx kit spec printed module sometimes list rank like 2r8 dual rank 1r8 cpuz tell many rank dimm ddr4 ryzen 5000 two rank per channel two singlerank dimms per channel pretty much always work 3600 mt provided stick compatible xmp profile three rank per channel work often four rank per channel much harder run
ok imma honest dont really understand whole like dual channel thing like 4 ram slot computer far tell look ddr4 like benefit using 2 stick 16 v 1 stick cost cuz like limit much put right
ill see happens gon na order ram couple week ill research meantime thanks input
yes dual channel better
additional context play game 1440p dont plan upgrading 4k mostly play tarkov warframe halo mcc smaller indie title moment im sure slight performance increase worth additional cost fully upgrading am5 like said post happy 5800x3d
thats 5700g without igpu 40707700xt better 1440p
psu 4070s work great
get dual tower cooler i7 like thermalright phantom spirit look good deal like used z590 mobo
tried audio jack front motherboard
happy performance moment yes keep current system upgrade
cpu bottlenecking 5080 would much effect pcie 40 pcie 50 really matter 5090 playing 4k anyway even like 2 difference wouldnt spend 5080 money use current cpu may better 1440p would likely still significantly bottlenecked 850 watt psu fine 5080 least come power adapter
yeahthe cpu bottlenecking another concern trying talk 5080but might best wait one generation hoping 5000 series going card take 4k mainstreambut fall short fps wise also 1440p monitor thought issave moneywait one generationthen upgrade whole system 2 1440 monitor 1080 1080 use document social medium etc 1440 gaming monitor keep stream show etc 2nd monitor thought upgradereplace 1080 current middle monitor get nice new 4k monitor main monitor upgrade whole system id think time 6000 series come outit big enough jump 4k gaming
""
gpu since always bottleneck matter gaming want enable resizable bar guess also took intel arc b580 consideration yeah saying dont
would avoid motherboard motherboard minimal power delivery probably enough 12400f reach max speed wont enough even minor upgrade past cpu socket work example put 14900k motherboard side note dont cpu reach max 6ghz turbo speed motherboard stuck 32ghz beyond h610 doesnt support pcie4 rtx 4060 also work limited eight pcie lane youll see loss 10 certain game want one chipsets b660 h670 b760 h770 z690 z790
really dont think ill upgrading long time ill consider b660
found gigabyte b760m h ddr4 quite cheap viable
best b760 board better h610 board itll prevent loss performance 4060 due pcie3 limitation id certainly choose h610 board considering
worth upgrade 25 euro reason
depends 25 mean guess 9700x would nobrainer
performance 9700x get lower power draw better work station task
7600x get 95 performance 7700x 23 price usually applies gaming though game arent really making use extra core
lower bank account
keep talking grabbing 40805080 final straw playing friend new build 4080s sure fps counter showed higher number didnt anything 3080 doesnt ill keep plugging along setup maybe pick something used year
youre currently able play game enjoy device doesnt struggle play thing want play unless money burn upgrading rt alone going big disappointment frame gen also buggy mess whenever ive tried
dont think amd 9000 going huge lift coming 3080 5080 decent little jump want get thing go crazy try get fe bestbuy tomorrow miss dont worry much
another gpu
imo biggest thing better dlss fsr help boost fps older generation tech
3080 still great gpu unless lack vram start tanking performance lot game would change tbh thats
3080 10 gb isnt enough 4k also upgrade monitor 1440p va 4k oled
depends goal game 1080p 60hz rt dont need upgrade rt hurt performance enough notice might worth upgrading aside always check lossless scaling frame gen available
get less jump could gotten 2 year ago price would paid 1 year ago
unless play aaa title 4k screen get hole wallet
nvidia way go frame generation ray tracing hopefully amd improves frame generation rt significantly soon 9000 series isnt looking great department unfortunately least compared nvidia 5000 series gpus far upgrade depends budget cpu game resolution play
empty wallet
rtx 50xx series fake frame ever
correct answer
agree amd focusing lower mid tier gpus maybe top card could provide similar performance lower power consumption less heat fsr boost fps probably best wait real benchmark review amd released
rt improved amd card nice cant stand frame genupscaling tech fact dlss 4 work previous gen make performance mode look actually viable 1440p insane got ultra quality fsr many artifact random ghosting frame gen cant stand
good maybe ram youre running youre 4k gpupsu
system fine moderate 1080p gaming youd need basically upgrade whole thing want good 1440p performance would keep youre unhappy performance save whole new current gen build future
looking looking spend whats giving issue current configuration
4060 ti 8gb worth could get something cheaper like 6750 use whatever left improve elsewhere
ram would recommend
want 1080p tbh even im getting bad frame drop stuff really struggling run game told run fine
hi playing game im getting bad frame drop really doesnt feel smooth game like r6 mainly game issue
sell 4060 use upgrade
another 2x8gb speed need reason least 3200mhz replacing since youre missing performance probably dont need add replace
upgrading 5700x3d would probably help especially high fps low quality setting competitive shooter game like cs2 5700x3d becoming hard find overpriced available
2 thing look upgrade cpu 5700x3d double ram 32gb kit fine honestly
would 4060ti 8gb awful
get curry 294 overpriced
thank much brother
point extremely powerful base youre limited gpu bad gpu powerful 4k gaming beast still want performance point going come big gpu want get
5600x another am4 mobo would fit budget
7600 xt day
7600xt
upgrade gpu bottlenecked cpu upgrade cpu bottlenecked gpu really need build whole new system instead upgrading cpu gpu might make sense start cpu upgrade since theyre readily available even 9700x would plenty system 9800x3d currently overpriced overkill highest end gpus really want x3d cpu 7800x3d may make sense currently
got ya thank advice yeah seems like upgrade sure think cpu would better upgrade least till upgrade gpu maybe find nice deal somewhere bundle something use bit upgrade part needed see
gpu getting sata drive accessory rgb hub require sata power decent psus enough cable use case unless get low end cheap model
many sata connected item gpu
one plug gpu ie gpu 2x pcie 8 pin 2 pcie cable notice cable isnt plug sata call many sata device youre gon na get usually ssds 25
rx 7800 xt pure gpu
1 cpu also use pcie fill power spot motherboard 7800x3d 2 wdblack doesnt use sata correct
rx 7800 xt pure sure whole sata thing work
cpu also use pcie cpu take power motherboard motherboard take power 24 pin atx cable thick one eps cable 4 ou 8 pin fill power spot motherboard 7800x3d absolutely necessary second cpu power cable aka eps usually needed unless youre gon na hardcore overclocker wdblack doesnt use sata correct wdblack could bunch stuff sure one mean rule thumb go m2 slot use sata ssdhdd screw case frame us sata power
good quality gold rated 750 watt psu plenty system necessary connector
okay 4 cpupcie slot im good plug 2 graphic card 2 cpu ssd m21 slot shouldnt need sata thanks help man appreciate
okay 850w currently thanks help appreciate
okay 4 cpupcie slot im good plug 2 graphic card 2 cpu clear cpu power cable pcie 8 pin interchangeable dont fit slot also gpu need 2 separate cable even one cable 2x pcie plug still need use 2 different cable split power ssd m21 slot shouldnt need sata positive
okay thank one final question would fan came case run sata rgb also
would fan came case run sata rgb also fan anything detail one case come get answer

okay sound good thanks help man life saver
reluctant go 4000 series missing frame gen 4000 frame gen normal one multi frame gen intention eventually running 4k 144hz speculate frame gen useful really useful already get good frame 4k without 80 ideally wont work lot game weaker gpus looking general recommendation gpu would pair nicely spec youll probably best 4080s 5080 increase budget bit remains seen 5070ti compared 4070ti super want go tier
1000 three option 5080 4080 super 7900xtx already ruled getting 4000series dont like amd leaf one 5080 problem solved original post figure get one
without budget could anything
5080 best option performance alone since nvidia recommends minimum 1000w psu 5090 5090 worth cost gaming alone imo unlikely youll get 5080 tomorrow time soon though 4080 super even 4070 ti super could decent find near retail pricing looking like 5000 series especially lower end model actually much faster higher end 4000 series gpus pure rasterization performance least seem faster frame generation tech enabled though
debate looking go 4070 ti super second hand price literally higher 5070 ti fe ill likely try get
strongly considering 4080 super aware sort frame gen still getting speed component long time since ive shopping lot changed hate uncertainty around 5000 series stuff readily available especially europe price look like
someone raised good point 4080 super moment ago swaying little also open input amd said im reluctant totally looking general inputadvice
make worse nvidia fe card bought uk u find portal eu place massive custom fee

fair enough
maybe list pc part also take look motherboard light tell u written next cpu ram gpu bios light helping diagnose
gpu 4070ti super cpu ryzen 7800x3d psu leadex iii gold 1000w motherboard tuf gaming b650e wifi ram corsair vengeance 32gb cant remember anything else also light say boot next
might make difference make sure bios updated
old 13700k may degraded socket could bending sell contact frame fix
stated already updated bios latest version
degraded may still extended warranty bought new
brand new bought barely like 78 month use forgot put yes ive already put contact frame also didnt help much
bios updated
sound like something wrong cpu especially another cpu work fine mobo cooling would rma intel replacement
always updated recent version updated time updated everytime saw new release
problem need pc work cant afford stay week without pc im waiting cpu tried cpu another rig another cpu rig cpu worked fine friend lowbudget pc explodes mine might get brand new better aio soon manage sell current one doesnt solve believe wont ill start saving new mobo z one least
sorry clearly missed tried cpu another system way around worked fine system either mobo cooling causing issue resetting bios default setting would eliminate setting may cause increase temp make difference look cooling
already tried default bios didnt change anything also mentioned tried friend cooler instead mine didnt make difference ill still try replace cooler nonetheless believe mobo problem check people playing helldivers 6570 around 90100w play around 80 130w instead
130 watt would certainly explain higher cpu temp mobo fine adequate cooling
sound like could failing gpu hard narrow without known good one swap unlikely driver issue since reinstalled window unless wasnt clean install wasnt clean install window running ddu wipe gpu driver installing latest version might worth try rule driver issue also make sure bios chipset driver window updated
update newest driver gpu bios etc run ddu ill try forget benchmark used stress gpu issue idk would tell anything since wasnt game unfortunately dont extra gpu moment

hard like oh yeah am4 completely going totally available cheaper price two year two year am5 may last supported generation 10 year newer pc better
go am5 get 7400f 7500f ali express cheapest way get am5
yeah thats thought am4 might obsolete upcoming year also mean 10 year newer pc thanks
going go am5 thinking getting 7800x3d thanks suggestion ill keep mind
pc 11 year old modern hardware going gigantic improvement
budget allows sure get best people struggle get onto am5 hard budget 1000
mobo coming manual crazy buy used go manufacturer website find model able download manual
apparently part come qr code pamhplet shit yes dumb edit guess understand mobos manual massive ctrlf godsend
yea built surprised find mobo told scan qr code much prefer physical manual
built higher end pc partner couple month ago literally every component came manual even fan maybe budget part issue
post reddit search forand find manual
manual almost always online make sense printed manual date product even ship especially revision hardware best fully read deciding one buy lot time detail really need know manual case generally sparse manual dont want print rosetta stone 16 language picture count part picture connector cable cooler often fairly well done yt video showing installation linked mfr web site complaining everything online well unhappy life going forward
qr code
one come 12 language
built four desktop last year half every single component including case fan came least small manual mobo full manual useful part bought used guess depends brand maybe mobo arriving late manual yeah suspect
mobo manual otherwise depends part manufacturer corsair particular make scan qr code everything case suck
mobo without manual really shitty b650e rock known cream crop still got comprehensive manual rest component seem expected documentation although aio picture showing valid orientation mobo cpu get
ive 2 build wouldnt say im experienced two ive came manual nearly everything
dont think going get better first pc window 95 came built top line best fastest biggest computer 2200 dollar 15 inch monitor spent thousand video card wasting two grand new video card month
lot thing going digital form documentation sometimes get lucky include usb drive manual otherwise go website hope best downside digital product discontinued get bought someone else may able get correct documentation longer
lot car dont even come owner manual anymore digital unfortunately also skimp quality documentation daysdetailed manual thing past seems
instead costing paper material producing waste product put everything clean pdf go manufacturer page look
yo also kinda pissed corsair last weekend reason finally upgraded two pc 8 year trying sort aio pump standoff use lga 1700 processor stressed online manual like graphic screw sure eventually able sort put bag label socket 16 screw unlabeled bag need 4 certainly choice

also didnt get one fact manual got case cpu cooler built month ago dunno norm frustrating time im new buildingrepairing pc also havent done one around time op expecting take 90minutes took around 4 hour bios flashing 9000 series took majority time three instruction set single one stating keep power flashing
mine didnt small slip said go warranty information go gigabyte website anything resembling manual
confirm msi mag x870 tomahawk doesnt come manual come quick start guide functionally useless
got msi x870 tomahawk didnt come manual expensive motherboards getting including manual really frustrating easy find online prefer physical manual much
brand new msi x670e tomahawk mobo come paper manual qr code
even x870e nova didnt come one pull online considered higher end board
apex encore 650 motherbaord came page slotting ram installing power cable even sheet bios code quick reference anything couldnt believe noticed videoout capability whatsoever late realize could return get dark hero biggest regretful spend life fault really assuming 650 top end motherboard would hdmi port possivly dp even single usbc video bad
another one proverbial pile brand new msi b550 motherboard didnt one quick start guide picture word
new amazon cause two day shipping ended taking closer month thought crazy basically taking box apart try find never even rely going website component manual though
like literally though better experience putting old build together able glance assurance ensure im something right saving printing sort stuff large enough suit thinking best option funnel people website
agree every part manual except ssd cpu lol
rantvent op computer got built build need paper hand
seems everything ive built last two year 6 desktop context thing without manual id expect one remember corsair icue aio qr code thing like ram cpu ssds would never even think manual never look come technical warranty information installation instruction usually motherboard case manual motherboard case cooler look everything else pretty straightforward covered one
yea b650e asrock came useful manual sure put though lol probably box extra stuff build
one hand agree waste paper hand phone screen still tiny reading manual hand much easier find manual online digging paper copy buried somewhere box storage misc manual drawer
paper manual lot easier deal v looking phone screen imo opinion many others
motherboard something absolutly come proper manual though ive never heard one shipping without lack manual make think motherboard isnt new id surprised motherboard come without manual standard
maybe something depth online computer isnt running since youre assembling mobile phone browse really suck hunt read pdf small screen fuck smurf
activate warranty card way harvest email btw legal activate way
thats crazy guess everyone trying save tree
took long likely shipped sold amazon
mean less saving environmentally friendlier b less waste let honest look manual like time c less clutter online manual experience isnt exactly fun physical manual dont make much sense anymore either time really want need physical manual im building furniture something need step step guide
board use work come 2 page pamphlet want manual need go website
company bare bone manual maybe something depth online last mobo bought asrock b450 fatal1ty thingy came nice manual booklet form print inside veeerry tiny almost need microscope read text decipher schematic fucking ridiculous really need hire proper document writer stuff inexcusable tech company skimp providing information properly install ware
pretty sure msi x670e tomahawk didnt come manual cant imagine needing information printed box though
absolutely cost first foremost selling website visitor data sweet bonus
less waste let honest look manual like time ive gone back mobos manual many many time year upgrade asrock
thats shit id personally avoid manufacturer started sending motherboards without manual buy often
first time builder manual amazing source information guidence put thing experienced builder still got useful info ram slot use first youre instlaling less stick slot since optimal slot vary board plus location m2 slot heatsinks fan header location since sometimes tricky spot
pretty sure msi x670e tomahawk didnt come manual mine come one figured way
x870 tomahawk x870 steel legend come manual either rightfully waste paper
tend look issue may online tend go manual cant find anywhere else there potential damage following something letter
youre gon na avoiding manufacturer lol curiosity last time bought mobo cause am4 one also didnt come manual
upside hosted pdf make correction removeadd list component work motherboard add warning bios update urgently needed manufactured version
why shit allows thing actually updated like motherboard entire ui replaced update old manual talking would date
bought asus tuf gaming b650plus last march upgraded 7800x3d came manual box
could still make change online hosted version people care date info providing printed version 999 info remain relevant people quickly access cant get online pc booting sure could likely access online version phone shouldnt imo
everyone building pc access another pc check building see part go eg best ram slot use diagnose fault pc doesent load building first time dont internet access really screwed come building info might relevent keep date bios update required new cpu there nothing stopping updating online manual info regardless physical one provided building first time good practise update bios anyway
thing dont change like diagram portsheaders ram slot order screw included etc
asrock b650i got came manual last month
everyone building pc access another pc check building would guess building modern pc 100 phone capable checking online manual
whats budget
thats amd radeon rx 7800 xt dual fan 16gb
around 500
would recommend 7800 xt maybe used 3080 thats feasible
many aib model passthrough fan well exclusive fe 40xx gpus worked fine air cooler
stick 1080 year 2030
3060ti really good card viable next 34 year sure example play game like forza horizon ultra setting butt 8gb vram limit game like new indiana jones 3060ti get job done low setting anything higher doesnt chop im waiting 4070 super get found one really competitive price dont really recent experience amd card
wouldnt get 3060 8gb look indiana jones think rt depends game idk id go 3060 dlss maybe dont think worth different stroke different folk
youre planning use ray tracing lot want dlss fsr rtx 3060 ti solid pick care extra vram future arent focused ray tracing rx 6700 xt might give better bang buck time think game play might want future make right choice
psu may still warranty corsair higher end psus least 10 year warranty certainly worth checking get replaced use new build motherboard likely damaged well hard narrow without swapping known good psu ram cpu sound like need replacing get quality ups doesnt get fried
yes definitely still warranty ill find receipt think psu would replaced without definitive answer whether defected
also sorry im aware ups protect surge could please explain
find receipt registered site purchase would certainly worth replacing safe psu often take damage power surge design protect rest component damaged using new system may damage component hard test without appropriate equipment get cheap power supply tester least check turn voltage correct doesnt test load guarantee working

youre u msi crazy promotion lately
average think 6700xt performance v 3060ti 1440p much different dont know talking fsr dlss nvidia dlss tends better amd fsr personally havent noticed much difference dont put much focus feature anything dlss occurrence causing issue actually benefitting
15 buck u get 6750xt slightly better however would go 6700 xt 8 gb vram good day
game getting 110 gpu utilization resolution quality setting thats low seems like cpu bottlenecking sure isnt thermal throttling issue temp cpu gpu running game cpu looking buying overkill 3080 streaming imo 9700x enough much cheaper unless plan significant gpu upgrade near future bundled mobo ram fine 9800x3d
system window problem
know silly question display cable plugged gpu cpugpu utilization seems fishy system powerful enough play game decent resolution
work atm speak thermal play apex legend marvel rival mainly playing mh wild come next month know cpu would overkill 3080 plan using short term get hand 50 series card didnt plan upgrading rn ive set aside fund specifically build spur moment thing
could elaborate
would certainly worth investigation cpu gpu issue 110 utilization gpu gaming normal start checking temp
game seeing 90 cpu usage 10 gpu unless brand new triple game think messy window need fresh install try ddu reinstall graphic driver sometimes window get internally borked fix fresh install
find place get 5000 series would say might well go possible 4000 series card seem like way availabilityalmost everything looked sold going get better likely swapping producing 5000 series gpus
200300 seems excessive am4 mobo get b550 mobos 100150 200 mobo would fine though
7800x3d9800x3d better 14600k
7800x3d 9800x3d

new 67006750xt
5700x3d would good cpu upgrade theyre getting harder find reasonable price stock 7600 xt similar would solid budgetoriented gpu upgrade long psu powerful enough still wouldnt meet recommended spec game youd need spend closer 1000 total
would able upgrade card without upgrading cpu yeah im happy hit recommended going expensive
httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html httpsukpcpartpickercomproductsvideocardc501523495558sortpricepage1
agree get new 6750 xt
looking spend little possible get something like local facebook marketplace card less 250
brand dont really matter much look decent 3 fan model cheapest define small worth getting anything 1tb tbh term value would rather 12tb adding one later budget tight
rbuildapcforme full list
aliexpress
copped 5090 100
i39100 paired rtx 3050 pretty slow setup gaming get 9600kkf good price would good upgrade would best served upgrading 9thgen platform though would expensive replacing cpu setup opportunity cost
thanks mate thinking maybe moving amd stock fan alone worth lol instead considering moving 9th gen would buy new mobo anyway ram stay though least save money
go modern platform youll buy ddr5 ddr4 put least 12 generation back appropriately reduced performance save money older preferably secondhand hardware able reuse ram
actual gaming performance look like feeling old cpu would give pretty poor 1 low stuttering anything relatively cpu heavy
check mobos cpu support list manufacturer website want see support cpu newer manual list also tell minimum bios version need installed cpu
check motherboard manufacturer product page 5700x3d listed compatible need bios update likely removing old cpu
thanks checked compatible
take class build system get job internship pc repair shop department kind work
know people might trying replace computer soon see theyre interested putting together pc part instead getting prebuilt building
youtube friend learned everything pc building watching video yoloing get handson experience
pc building simulatorhttpsstoresteampoweredcomapp621060pcbuildingsimulator
doubt lenovo motherboard support bifurcation cpu connected slot likely top pcie slot connects cpu get full 16 lane cpu pcie slot lower slot probably connect chipset dont share lane cpu connected slot
hard tell prebuilt system since often u proprietary motherboards info configured available hard find best would stick sata ssd safe cant even sure pcie m2 adapter card work sata guaranteed work isnt noticeably slower loading program game especially older less powerful system imo
m2 expansion card come bifurcation here list used past expansion card httpsforumsservethehomecomindexphpthreadsmultinvmem2u2adaptersthatdonotrequirebifurcation31172 work well might cheaper go different routelike 25 ssds upgrading current p3 larger drive
good bad
ill probably go sata
definitely safest route upgrade current m2 larger drive
think benchmark showing youll get 70something percent improvement whether thats worth price tag nvidia recommending use 850 w 5080 might able get away 750w
750w seems like kind close upgrade 5080 quick estimate might alright good quality psu doesnt hurt least try see behaves always return since youre buying locally pretty significant upgrade term performance also quite chunk money well apart updated bios microcode update 14700k also temp like nhd15s thermal throttling
still run 3070 almost everything ultra 4k screen dlss set balanced youre professional training ai model dealing rendering complex thing maybe upgrade 5090 company pay otherwise would wait next gen next next gen
upgrade bios undervolt cpu think running around like 50 game stresstests doesnt hit 100 edit checked maxed 86 4 hour stream playing marvel rival
run marvel rival stream 4k play 120fps dlss performance everything low model detail medium 2k
reset cmos disabled xmpexpo beforehand also wouldnt surprised cpu cant run stick ddr5 6400 thats hard ddr5 general
reset cmos pc would post bios least ive turned xmp
look like cpu imc cant try lowering speed find stable setting would probably start 3600mt use memtest stability testing make sure running latest bios version improve memory stability compatibility
appreciate help gon na bite bullet return set stick money back pc still run 2 new stick
wouldnt worry 1440p 4k gpu intensive game primarily play 1080p low esports title faster cpu probably needed
keep 12700k upgrade youre satisfied 5070 ti performance game play overclocking 12700k also improve performance long right motherboard good cpu cooler
msi z690 edge wifi corsair h150i elite capelix enough also impression unlikely bottleneck play mostly 1440p dont need hundred fps game like csgo
certainly worth trying gpu upgrade first always upgrade cpu later necessary
cpu wouldnt change anything wont core architecture bit clockspeed probably even enough notice performance difference literally less 5 boost clock improvement cant get 5700x3d 5800x3d good price sit 5700x youre ready full platform upgrade
youll see benefit upgrading am5 got ta factor price new mobo ram
awesome help time put money aside big build next year
see benchmark lower 50xxs existing 40xxs 5090 question price also term psu
dont want change cpu point im thinking along line radeon rx 7900 xt geforce rtx 4070 ti super radeon rx 7900 xtx geforce rtx 5070 5070 ti depending review
well bad news cpu bad gaming bought 4070ti super didnt saw really big improvement compared old 2080 super changed cpu gained double fps new gpu every mentioned model gpu want bottlenecked 3900x guarantee
ok look like also realized existing psu capped xx70 card
okay thats fine know sell 3900x would put 100 could get 5700x3d would enough
yep mate see improvement even reason game interested multiple core thread clock speed good cache good luck
depending type game play may make sense upgrade gpu cpu looking pcpartpicker look save tiny bit bundle nothing life changing
yeah noticed huge saving amount still save least lol game mainly like diablo 4 poe 2 rocket league heavily modded minecraft cod odd game mainly
mean resolution would fine 4090 would give lot better fps compared 4070ts think upgrading am5 later year next year
motherboards rarely influence performance unless bad powerthrottle cpu theyre connectivity one look pretty bad though without vrm cooling id consider higherend motherboard run ddr5 matter would probably build am5 lga1700 dead socket anyway
support ddr5 chose ddr5 version ddr5 32 gb ram yeah heatsink rather weak vram design advice problem im tight budget go super highend motherboard
ah must clicked wrong version yeah 14600kf cost combined 240mm water cooler ryzen 5 7600 give around game performance stock cheap air cooler also providing actual upgrade path want upgrade cpu future without rebuilding entire pc
thank taking time reply need advice motherboard already bought whole setup im thinking replacing motherboard better one unbox
screen shot show ram running 6000 cl36 unless mistaken make believe 4800mhz say check memory tab task manager performance monitor simply enabling expo profile ram work shouldnt need manually adjust setting since profile automatically set frequency timing voltage enabling profile doesnt seem sticking could ram stable profile case system reverts default ram setting fails boot properly bios update may help good idea update bios anyway would start reenable expo see stick
try slot 2 4 ddr make sure power cable especially 84 cpu power secure clear cmos slow internet shouldnt mess driver couldve corrupted
solution ram issue something wrong one ram stick one still function working 1ram stick rma replacement
using split 8 pin 4 pin designed split point 48 pin psu doesnt dedicated 4 pin pretty standard old motherboard 8 pin
luck removed battery cmos clear even changed cable power connector little afraid ive damaged cpu
one partition drive window bios update probably reset setting therefore may booted wrong drive change boot order point proper drive
sound like bios reset setting check boot order bios thats fine try system restore reinstall window
see monitor everything running better everything else still old

buy 50904090 actually get upgrade
dont think 5080 upgrade
might sell 7900xt 9070xt pricing reasonable
looking review 50 faster rt card without dlss
buy 5080 youre 100 confident resell think 4090 even 5090 way better want 5080 future proof wan na go 4k cool shit nvidia
look pretty good wouldnt get 5080 msrp though youll probably better trying find good deal used 4090
corsair asus tend price premium brand name overall build look fine put pcpartpickercom check compatibility
5080 best 1000 market 1015 faster 4080 7900xtx best bang 1000 xtx 850
1000 id personally go 5080fe may benched high people hope 4080 super like 1150 bh id rather newer card thats
building new pc budget 1k gpu get 5080 currently 4080 4080 super buy 5080 3080 maybe worth
think 5070 ti instead seems worth saving first look
7900 xtx way im paying 1000 buck 16 gb vram card garbage 4 year time
7900xtx brainer
one buy 1000
switched 7900 xtx best switch ever im done nvidia 5080 dumpsterfires gon na hard carried ai rather raw performance bit less fps instead 300 fps added latency artifact
3080ti 400 used slap dlss performance new dlss4 come youre set really wan na spend 1k guess 5080 manage get one
3080 wait til march 9070 xt
might well buy used 4080 super 7900 xtx spend bit little used 4090 4090 remain second best gaming gpu year two 6080 arrives seeing nvidia probably intentionally gimp 6080 match slightly outdo 4090 rofl
3080 id probably aim 4090 dont mind used much less isnt really worth money
given fe 1k think aib markup still make 5080 worth
odds even getting 5080fe id love feel like card going sell quickly anyways get scalped
5080fe different 5080
also new tensor core mfg much something
reminder 4080 within overclock range 5080 worst generational leap yeeaars
left one arent review yet go 9070 9080 xt might interesting information especially 9070 around 500
people buying thing dont care hanging gpu four year
inb4 nvidia fanboys cant handle truth downvoting ive team green life im done
youre willing buy amd 7900xtx already good deal
thats im ill probably wait 50 series super refresh
4090 used going 1724k
aibs also 1k variant thats always anyway usually three model one msrp others add 1030 better component cooling profit
extremely low unless code bot
approximately good fucking luck percent least launch fe maintain high demand lack aib tax since ampere actually solid cooler design initial burst upgrade wear 5080 similar availability 4080
""
im upgrading 1080 ti absolutely hang 4 year thats part buying top line card dont worry least 4 year minimum
800 maybe 9070xt could similar performance better ray tracing maybe 500 id expect 600 though
4080 super came 15 year later 4080 depends highly situation want wait thing would wait need upgrade soon 5070 ti doesnt look much worse 5080 amount ram price range 16gb kind ok 5080s price much although must say many reason price availability may get even worse really want upgrade wait long buy 5080
5080 super 5080 2 performance 949
really would expected lower still havent got getting 4090 brand new rrp early 2023
hate shit
ok thanks new trying f first build gifemotefreeemotespackdizzyface
everyone waiting vram upgrade happens may worth waiting although adding vram would bad 6000series may really expect lower price
yeah suck hope drop tomorrow
founder edition offered directly manufacturer ie branded sold nvidia come asdescribed minor tweak oc anything brand set apart
aww youre sweet
going drop thats good 4090 strix still monster 24gb vram going hold value always buy highest end card every generation
bro he going show
im buying 2000 card eats 600w unfortunately
4090 hovers around 400450w time yes agree point stick amd 50 series got 4090 1200 tax back early 2023 buyer remorse vanished see either maintains value even go time remember time new generation lower end card would match performance previous generation flagship miss getting gtx 970 match performance 780ti great feeling want better performance 4090 need go flagship 5090 sad
cpu upgrade make sense youre right since 5000 series card next gen amd arent even officially available yet unlikely youll able get one time soon 9800x3d likely smooth 1 percent low unlikely increase overall fps much dont expect night day performance increase would need gpu upgrade 9800x3d still significantly overpriced due low supply high demand though hard even find stock legit retailer definitely dont buy one sketchy amazon marketplace seller aliexpress report counterfeit lid swapped faked cpu especially aliexpress might worth waiting get new gpu upgrading definitely want powerful psu 1000 watt enough much 850

feel comfortable 4090 even 5080 review
currently new indiana jones game struggle 16gb thats path tracing enabled game peaking 1415 gb vram usage answer question answer 16gb future proofing 4k gaming bare minimum plan staying 1440p resolution next upgrade safe
16gb sweet spot running local llm good luck finding card reasonable price
shouldnt game arent optimizing creating weird glitch example 4090 cant run cod medium couple match without crashing due direct x crash using vram common problem
16 good 2030 know game day dont optimised use hardware compensate look current console spec ps5 example halfway life cycle already 2030 console 5060 series gpu spec currently ps5 using 16gb imo buy 3090
recommend 32gb starter gamers unless old setup 6 slot max 24gb window 10x64 end life 11 mess ram space use boot drive 512gb swap space limit storage alot ram
definitely moving past point 16 gb future proof mean still fine vast majority game probably considerable future indiana jones easy max completely even 1440p think game something signaling point think game start follow requiring rt going see happen doom dark age next one top head
okay lot people saying 16gb enough generally agree game day simply requiring play 1440p 144hz ive already ran multiple game needed hogwarts legacy ran literally half speed 16gb matter setting played switched 32gb instantly smooth gaming experience game used 2931gb given time year ago also play escape tarkov us upwards 29gb game also much better since upgrading saying game super optimized 1440p gaming imo 32gb kinda standard close kind game got absolute limit ive since upgraded 64gb really future proof setup costbenefit worth reallly wont worry anything long time also confidently play kind game thing open dont worry anything take
thing future proofing buy two 8gb stick need later put another pair 32gb
vram somewhat rated
3090 24gb already obsolete
yes add 16g becomes patently insufficient
ram stopped working time got 16gb couple day play 2k horrible cranked everything still got stutter ram constantly 100
yes 16gb enough gaming future especially 1440p nvidia developed advanced ai compression mechanism enables high performance high quality texture reduces memory requirement read httpsresearchnvidiacomlabsrtrneuraltexturecompressionhttpsresearchnvidiacomlabsrtrneuraltexturecompression even 4k gaming 16gb memory adequate remember nvidia developing product testing performance across many different game arent going release product hamstrung one buy
example diablo 4 already pushing 81 vram 4090 plan 4k would say 16 gb already enough
certain vr game already easily fill 16gb high setting
noticed lol tried editing post include vram end gb hopefully avoid confusion idk think im worried every computer ive gotten past always ended falling behind category whether vram investing good enough cpu getting monitor low refresh rate etc time around im hoping make beast computer getting recent cpu couple month ago getting 40xx 50xx series card etc saw card 32gb vram thought might need get future proof seems like 5080 16gb vram enough long time probably paranoid
wont find 5090 2000usd least year maybe two due scalper even itll probably closer 2500 third party model add another 1000 europe
yeah latest dlss4 new game coming needing ray tracing doesnt seem like good idea go amd right unless come something
doesnt want ray tracing 8gb 3070 turn rt game like cyberpunk eats vram yes dlss help really close thats setting reduced otherwise fps isnt good enough even dlss happy 30 fps play really high setting rt isnt enough vram 1440p
dont banking people buying 8gb 16gb limited theyll bank people realising 12 month time 8gb isnt enough buying new 16gb version
want ray tracing isnt exactly true alan wake 2 rt enabled almost unplayable anything less 16gb 50 series card game pretty much requires 15gb 1 gb free 1000 gpu playing 15 year old game absolutely certainly enough next couple year minimum ltt cover review httpsyoutubefbg7chsjmeat386 sure say dont use ray tracing isnt like one main reason buy nvidia card moment top new game starting require rt problem get worse worse time 16gb fine absolutely would say itll plenty enough many year come
fellow 3080 enjoyer see im 4k problem far
definitely future proof usable ultra setting 10 year probably 16gb dlss quality 1440p still good enoug least 5 year unless revolution video game graphic suddenly requires lot vram
game starting hit 16gb 3440x1440 let alone 4k resolution sure lower graphic use upscaling doesnt change fact premium gpu priced 1400 better
future proofing hopeless endeavor hardware always get behind speed planning upgrade path way go spare overspending thing trying make build last forever upgrade need also god forbid relearn lost art turning graphic setting happy visualsperformance
framegen feature us less vram far useful feature upscaler us slightly vram
7900xtx 24gb vram
hitting 15gb 1440p hogwarts legacy 3440x1440 maxed rt im 11ish 4k get high
run hogwarts rt 3080 fine stutter high setting though really need upgrade though 10gb use high instead ultra game
op talking video card memory ddr memory 16 vram enough graphic card
thats almost whole game rendered loading screen lol
7900xtx run cod ultra 24gb pretty much play fps game xtx great
plug vram stick gpu cant find mine
ur joking right lol
add
op asking vram ram
indiana jones 4k supreme pt go 16gb 4080 reducing texture high dlss help
nonsense lol 4080 super performs 7900 xtx 24gb vram 4090
uevr game max 4090 vram
bought 3090 came performance increase 3080 minimal wanted 24gbs ai model wanted run 16gbs enough gaming seems wild
like play halflife alyx gtx 1080
post budget people make pc factoring future proof concern
doubt visit steam hardware surveyhttpsstoresteampoweredcomhwsurvey majority gamers still running 8gb less vram 22 4gb less dont care running latest aaa game maxed setting 16 gb usable long time still
probably double tariff actually happen u
painfully correct cheapest 4090 could find go 2500e
nvidia always stay ahead ray tracing ray tracing huge concern op shouldnt consider amd dlss good fsr little behind seem work complaint time amd card driver instability year ago might even factor anymore
seems like game going mandatory ray tracing 5060 looking dead arrival
rinse repeat infinite money glitch
wouldnt call future proof game today use much sure 16gb good enough awhile especially ultra setting game today use 16gb definition longer future proof ram 32gb future proof anymore itll run game well enough long wouldnt call future proof game today use much
dont even remotely recall title thats hitting 16gb 3440x1440 know one article showcased
topic 1440
80 tier isnt premium tier youre thinking 5090 4090 still wan na run max setting want max gpu tier skimp buy tier youll tune gfx setting little
ive read us ever slightly vram upscaler
frame generation us vram dlss use vram quite literally lowering input resolution lower vram required easily test monitoring vram usage static scene turn dlss onoff
thats said
easier developer whole universe loaded whole time
oh definitely glitch issue mw3 directx err seems prevalent high end card
download vram
bad hehehe
diablo 4 max 4090 vram paper really allocates much
16gb enough 99 game one arent literally lower one two setting really big deal thats say important getting gpu wouldnt get one less 16gb ive perfectly happy 4080 using 3440x1440 monitor
take account even cheapest modern vr headset two 4k screen
get home work probably link custom pc currently mind set cyberpowerpc waiting 5080 go sale updating posting honestly might make new thread update see people would change budget generally around 3k go little need id like keep 4k
price go another 20 30 god forbid 100 one planet would able afford gpus computer anymore lol going hobby exclusive mega rich imagine 5000 gpus add component top shudder well least sony microsoft gon na veeeery happy welcome huge influx expc refugee next system lol
little behind generous amd considering dlss 4 transformer model dropped way better cnn model amd losing
game make raytracing mandatory nvidia dominating wont small issue anymore tho
admittedly 2 card ago amd setup horrible random game driver finicky switched gtx 1070ti havent looked back 3080 prob upgrade 5080 bc card 4 year old point im rambling nvidia driversstability amazing amd always gave trouble
apparently guy playing pavlov last night said crash every hour driver idk amd ever rx580 went nvidia havent issue since even overclocking amazing run 3030mhz 2000 mem smooth issue except cyberpunk overclock game always hated overclocks lol
32gb future proof youre taking definition future proof literally logic 1terabyte vram probably future proof either
know alan wake 2 rt enabled hit 16gb 4k sure 3440 x 1440 though doubt whole lot less
see op edited post
agreed still really hard justify spending much money something doesnt yield best result possible thing gone outrageously expensive last couple year 1080 bought back 2017ish didnt feel expensive
dlss use vram quite literally lowering input resolution lower vram required frame generation us vram
ik lol thats saying us much vram
wait 4080 super play like max everything want dont see vram getting capped
diablo 4 also work fine i7 6700k gtx 1080 32gb ddr4 running hdd window 7
12gb still enough 99 game 2560x1440p
3080 still run everything max resolution 60hz though bought one first ultrawides still using
game memory store stuff like texture file two 4k screen doesnt mean use twice memory memory need fast enough gpu process
even surely need one set texture loaded memory screen
like 1 4k total quest 3 resolution 2064 x 2208 per eye
cant speak quality prebuilt service generally people avoid review mixed bag save money personal assurance put together perfectly pcpartpicker far best website assembling conceptual pc depth compatibility system post desired monitor size top 5 game want play whether want rgb people happy put together list wont receive advice probably anything back link customized prebuilt
youre right generous dont enough experience fsr put like plus always hopefully next iteration big improvement
youre confusing ray tracing path tracing though amd handle ray tracing game pretty well long higher end card path tracing amd shit bed give
maybe thats reality right probably wont many year ive heard one single game thats announced require ray tracing cant even remember game
depends rt indiana jones builtin rt xtx run fine 4k supreme setting natively pt average gamer 30606600 type card wont alienate
depends detail needing ray tracing lowest setting amd work fine
7900 xt constantly adjust stuff software make run smoothly constantly issue fan going full 100 pretty much load wasnt completely miserable ive never dealt anything like 5 6 nvidia card
there always case team green red driver unstable one reason another ive nvidia amd card last 10 year driver issue nvidia amd ive also card nvidia would honestly say even driver stability experience take one really bad experience either way though put brand
least obvious nvidia employee look comment history
32gb ram literally recommended amount aaa game today considering price ddr5 ram aint exactly problem yes 32gb ram isnt future proof almost needed default system isnt budget category id say 24gb vram still futureproof even though there game today pushing close 16gb recommended today needed today future proof
thing gone outrageously expensive last couple year thank federal reserve circa 2020 combined neoliberal neoconservative economic policy bad
16gb scale game run great 12gb alloc usage arent ive seen alloc 22gb 24gb use 6gb go run texture setting 8gb gpu stutter
doesnt use double memory resolution still take toll vram look 1080p v 4k vram test frame buffer two image
got chance test 7900 xtx couple week decided ultimately 4080 super huge part upscaling 1440p 4k using upscaling basically nobrainer due similar dlss look native sometimes even better game poor taa go 60 teetering 50 4k max setting 90 comfortably quality level upscaling keep mind dlss 4 available fsr offered similar performance gain shimmering artifacting distracting im sure fsr 4 better look better based little theyve shown also gon na exclusive new card
ah okay wondering thank
indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow full time ray tracing require rx 6600 better play 7800 xt handle indiana jones 4k 60 fps ray tracing really concern latest amd card
yeah ive never issue either one ive really owned card maybe year changing maybe thats know time update driver game act weird update fine lol
wish lol im stay home dad like showing people want card em definitely worth bios flash em extra power
thought meant vram bro lol still 32gb future proof ram usage go linearly game visuals ram doesnt ram recommendation usually exponential like 6 year ago 8gb enough started recommending 16 started recommending 32 start recommending 64 year year away game still need 16gb even one recommend 32 work flawlessly 16
yeah ive played d4 4k 4070 laptop held 60 fps fine whilst using 8gb vram pc play 1440p see using 16gb lol
ill say run flawless 3080 10gb well likely need less even
sure let say computer rendering wall setting set high using high resolution texture wall texture file use memory larger course using higher resolution texture require ram store vr us 2 screen mean require significantly memory data used screen 90 level card needed good gaming performance
worry cyberpunk good example play fine 7800xt7900xt xtx ray tracing enabled moment touch path tracing though basically drop 20 fps opposed running 90120fps
ac shadow selective raytracing mode older gpus hideout forced software raytracing game released software raytracing avatar star war outlaw silent hill 2 game work non rt gpus everything rendered software indiana jones doom dark age hardware based raytracing mean take advantage hardware rtx rx 6000 series gpus
yeah ray tracing path tracing vastly different former fine latter
thats basically case example mine 4060 desktop v 4090 7900xtx among many othersgame dev qa lab stuff baseline game data source scaling
agree point there still lot calculation go render two perspective game processing need done two camera game engine post processing need done two image objective vram usage go
youre correct computing calculation definitely take space vram personally havent issue since started playing around vr oculus dk1 graphic card 4gbs vram instead going reddit rabbit hole ill admit valid point ill tip non existent hat take drink hope good day sir madam

ryzen 3000 cpu bottleneck going 3950x 14700k 6900xt got 1030 fps 3440x1440 re

pc rack rack take away lot space
look sliger rack case really quiet
thought youre gon na run cable said rack youre gon na use device
thanks input thats kind going rather 3 tower spread around one rack corner something
thanks tip
mind rack would somewhere desk really longer cable anything would require special solution like optical id keeping within distance limitation displayport
card strix extra aesthetic bigger cooler
context limited tell u isnt much cant identify problem dont give u detail happen game comparing game resolution using setting

happen game fps get fps get resolution playing
got average 220fps lowest 180 peak 300 got average 170 peak 230 lowest 120ish started benchmark identical setting 1080p temp normal gpu usage 98 mean gpu perform better max usage
running program background game mean situation performance better eliminate hardware issue
running riva statistic check temp game situation similar always get better stable performance squad44 example get better performance even though heavy single core cpu game cpu dont know gpu cpu problem point

theyre valid id probably go 9700x 2 fasterhttpsyoutuberlfthczbnnqt1136 6 price increase look overall system say 1k cost 20 2 pretty good
perform basically thats reflected price may well go w newer chip difference price minimal real alternative would something much cheaper like 7600 thats need gaming save money better gpu
resolution 1440p gpu 3070ti
updated comment still applies might better saving buck 7600x
alright cool thank going am5 650watt psu would pairing 7600x 3070ti require psu higher wattage okay paring
put build pc part picker look expected wattage zachs tech turf youtube recommends adding 30 wattage seems like good rule follow

absolutely correct trying figure get front mesh slide everything thought would easier work could remove entire panel
yes since game becoming hungry af maybe soon break 16gb actual needed vram barrier work lowering texture quality upscaling happens also wont run native 4k path tracing even 5090 still wonder dont give like 20gb guess ngreedia
im shoe
may small handful game ultra setting everything cranked need 16gb vram game next 5 year like 5080 beat 3090 like 99 time 4k edit 12gb enough setting httpsyoutubefbg7chsjmeat390httpsyoutubefbg7chsjmeat390 either 5080 beat 3090 100 time wont run get game demand 16gb vram perhaps resolution 4k multiple monitor maybe 5080 basically beat 3090 like 9999 time youd 5080 turn setting keep vram use 16gb 3090 would probably getting like 15fps situation game demand 16gb vram thats kind pointless play
im curious 1 3090 would win 5080
something think vram doomers miss benchmark arent realistic use case trying get objective performance actually gaming opposing dlss upscaling dlss quality would perform slightly worse 1440p native much better vram performance requirement 4k native benchmark meanwhile upscaling leader dlss usually trading blow yearold videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvo5bdqisyc depending game compared 4k native going get worse concern dlss metaphorical lipstick pig cover optimization devs dont see leaving 5080 owner saying literally cant play game tv id expect game running poorly outright flop performance issue
httpsyoutubefbg7chsjmeat390httpsyoutubefbg7chsjmeat390 1 likely high perhaps 1 time maybe like 12 game probably requires resolution 4k concern itd probably non ray traced game ultra setting may get game 16gb card cause fail certain setting like 12gb card couldnt handle test could name game 3090 beat 5080 exist perhaps doesnt even exist except ridiculous circumstance basically noone worry probably would require multi monitor setup 23 4k monitor

im around budget 1500 thats best current situation
why thanks

temperature nowhere near problematic doesnt seem issue solve
uhhh expect
dam bro really said hey pc isnt anywhere near thermal throttling ok
temperature incredible thing considered
idle temp higher used past mfgr realized could turn fan low even save electricity wear motor reduce noise
perfectly fine temp actually kinda want build
sound pretty damn normal think youre good
idle temp maybe degree higher would expect man full load temp good think reason worry point

depends power supply case something bought year ago support like low quality component time go power supply doesnt support new feature like 12vhpwr cable go case newer component might bigger hotter requiring bigger case better airflow design
depends part case power supply storage usually used im building new rig current one 5 year m2 drive 850w psu going new pc save decent chunk change use get even better component

like thing ever purchase pc part either die old age become obsolete use case gifted someone still use absolutely use used part generally dont old part new enough useful time putting together new system help someone else generally tell get used part someplace kind protection part bad otherwise get best deal new part reliable source buying used part looking old part ask would consider part new likely need different part
slowing often solved clean install o making sure ssds enough ram new game constraint different matter dont gaming happy use older hardware used server hardware particular amazing durable thing need newish graphic card screen really got lot bigger new video codecs use hardware acceleration

reuse whatever case probably around 20 year old oldest hdd approaching 15 id using psu well sadly doesnt cpu power connector new part require get relegated backup duty rest old system
ive bought plenty part 2nd hand worked well im also trying run aaa title whenever upgrade always pas older part younger nephew built computer scrap hand part also dont play demanding title sometime surprise upgrade oldest one 17 younger one 13 wich make proud uncle good way bond em since wife dont kid

neva new build new cable keyboard even desk
never literally hoard pc multi purpose always good multiple pc
something consider case case 7 year ago tend limited support aios best challenge using looking using aio youll want take consideration additionally newer case lot qualityoflife feature make building cable management much easier well better airflow going important cooling hot component day recently similar task upgrading gut nephew build old case fitting even 240mm aio challenge several month later swapped case new one much much easier came ease building easily supported 360mm aio psus depends psu wattage efficiency warranty enough wattage still warranty definitely consider continuing use psus 10 year warranty always upgrade later cash especially meet need time
paid flagship psu plan use 10 year warrantied lmao
reused psu case drive
case would say shouldnt issue long everything fit reason new case might nice want usb c port front something power supply something wouldnt reuse yes brand name high rated power supply good however important part computer additionally cause much damage like catch fire thats something id buy new one problem
past build everything new except used gpu hard drive moved everything else 7 year old figured surved useful life thought reusing case didnt modern io havent reformatted 7 year would recommend window tends get bloated
would reuse upgrading often much usefull stuff old pc gave previous pc parent give pc also previous one support window 11 take gpu though maybe use new pc buying 5080 5070 ti somehow broken though dont think sell
like joke current desktop thirty year old shipoftheseused way amd 386dx40 current i712700k every upgrade involved least one part sticking around even system drive getting kept around storage
nvmes upgrade everything get upgraded except m2
psu case though next rig change always pay bit psucase also storage brainer guess
depends need updating rarely put together completely new system part outlive build like psu psus die btw last one died 12 year work 3 build
depends long go build upgrading try keep using psu andor case long possible storage io device make sense keeping last upgrade cycle though many thing changed went full new build point keeping old hard drive old dvd drive nothing come physical dvd download everything nvme slot also recent development even old sata ssds dont make much sense move though still keep bottom line make sense reuse replace
want able sell current pc whenever build new one likely keeping storage 5tb wasnt selling id maybe keep power supply aio case personally nzxt h510 airflow isnt great also fuck nzxt
almost every time
yep originally reused old psu got horrid coil whine upgraded case wise really love mine could absolutely go something front panel usbc
good point never thought ill double check case psu thanks
nice thanks advice
good hear youre saving money im going try
ship pcus
upgraded mobocpu first time since 2015era x99 build recently switched am5 upgraded r9 290x 2060 last year
also hand approach brother get 2 generation
also use pc theseus strategy continuously upgraded main pc one part time since like 2008 fun think possible start i5 2500k stayed relevant long time needed new cpu much current gpu situation full rebuild im hoping 7600x3d last longer 9600k dont think anything worry
awesome glad youre able reuse old part
good know look like ill go tht route
thanks psu seven year old ill check get away new build
thank yougreat suggestion
thanks still window xp vista machine taking space
good point solve everyday task lagging think get newer cpugpu point aa game like laggy
nice need check case see bracket removed video card align new setup cant remember screwed ripped
7 year old power supply unless top quality psu would psu really fuck system better protect new hardware case issue compatibility new hardware
say single remark psu fairly high end unit 850w gold 2012 believe paid around 200 get platinum like 80120 crazy part became much attainable time
replacement screw bracket dirtcheap
thanks info psus expensive might play safe however case seem quite pricey
one httpsyoutubengy9tibrejesibuhloavudmknoxia
good luck getting 5090
dream
true
agree thought process either 7900 xtx probably best choice 4070 super isnt bad want save cash considering youre playing 4k wouldnt best 5year lifespan
probably want hold new amd gen see good value 9070 sound like rival 7900xtx lower price improved ray tracing cant wait 7900xtx 4070super probably best bet imo
7900 xtx hand seeing 5080 benchmark complete dumpsterfire care raytracing thing maybe 4080 super 4070 super pick go 7900xtx switched im done nvidia
9070 sound like rival 7900xtx get information amd graphhttpsimgurcomakblrkdy placing 9070xt level 7900xt
whats
list really expensive part good hmm im gon na go yes
mainly going used heavy gaming occasional video editing sometimes also enjoy self hosting minecraft server friend play suppose could use previous rig
understand going good im wondering there optimization could make
5080 basically priced 4080 super offer around 510 better performance take grain salt since dont detail yet youre happy 3070 ti there rush upgrade considering moving 4080 super year 5080 essentially equivalent term cost upgrading 3070 ti 5080 would solid performance jump hope make sense
boat 2080ti get 5080 rush settle
initial review im seeing im significantly less excited gaming doesnt seem like much improvement 40 series coming 30 series understandable though
wife plain jane 3070 probably going wait another gen 9900k30701440p still game well
disappointment shitwreck better thought would expecting 7 increase 1011 still garbage product dont expect buy 1000 usd msrp especially aib card aibs simply dont room make money price add limited quantity people paying 14001500 disappointment shitwreck 5080
wait rx 9070 xt could end like 90 5080 performance like half price
ill skipping 50 series entirely
dont know sure since hasnt reviewed assuming 15 faster 4080 case double current fps
yes make sense crazy one got hold asus tuf 4080s hasnt arrived yet paid 1150 also able put order local pc store 5080 1300 cancel 4080s order 5080 order
reviewed roughly 11 4k 4 1440p lmao
saw post youre pretty spot 14
lot benchmark got 5080 similar performance 4080 super check gamersnexus hardwareunboxed etc decide yoruself
wouldnt say waste money 150 difference get newer generation longer support gddr7 vram dlss 4 even youre particularly interested major feature worth 150 id say yes especially high end dont even see 5090 true gamer flagshipits luxury enthusiast like want latest greatest matter cost use dlss 5080 way go like friend mentioned check gamer nexus 4080 super v 5080 comparison detail
yeah im expecting 15 1440p well find tomorrow
use dlss 4080 super also good dlss 4 mfg thats much difference
honest 3x fps great feature everyone looking
certainly useful people mean isnt much different fg 4080 super already extension feature increase frame rate also degrades image quality latency like 4080 super support dlss performance mode 5080 add ultra performance mode
would say thats kinda average price people think 3080ti gold performance wise 3080 3080 ti close performance 12 go better though 3080 12 gb cheaper ti
ebay sold item local id expect pay like 10 9070 xt coming perhaps 550 march wait wait
maybe im biased picked asrock x670e pg lightning great issue least expensive x670e board available
motherboard go well support 99 am5 motherboards market thing cpu need motherboard work like
thx advice guy
amd radeon probably hundred different amd radeon card one specifically important
subreddit build pc name youre supposed buy part build getting prebuilt one
dont plan building forget sub go another reccomed part sutch full build go rbuildapcforme like one prebuilts unless youre willing build sub intent intimidate may sounded bit rough nice day
yeah 5700g apu list amd radeon graphic card im guessing board gpu cpu meaning actual physical graphic card pc wont run well game also 5700g am4 socket isnt necessarily bad outdated soon amd longer creating am4 processor said budget kind restricts am4 also id say 512gb storage isnt enough id want 1tb would well 32gb ram would much better 16gb without massive price difference personally budget 1000 cad there great deal could get new id say youre gon na buy pre built get second hand one price honestly really hard build pc use youtube video pretty much part process installation wouldnt even need video somebody part build one would best id go something like ryzen 5 5600 32gb ram maybe something like amd rx 6600 build would probably bit expensive prebuilt found 1 million percent better value would last longer said looking requirement one specific game guess pc found would work imho would buying ever
take look prebuilds subreddit information youre looking build fellow canadian field pretty bad prebuilds isnt much good price especially 1000 mark really want bang buck build pc look help building one httpscapcpartpickercomlistlqjm3w
try rbuildapcforme help give suggestion based need budget etc
sense looking get prebuilt would recommend looking ibuypower best prebuilts imo come graphic card said amd card issue didnt say card make assume based cpu price utilizing integrated graphic cpu rather dedicated graphic card dont know requirement flight sim stuff racing sim world definitely want decent graphic card 16 gb ram especially want run vr
probably integrated graphic price point 5700g technically apu amd advertisement
im sorry im element best buy website list graphic card amd radeon graphic dont id find proper model spec
apology couldnt find pc community thought fit looking buy prebuilt far element dont really know start subreddits would recommend
ok thank check sub even post people redirect helpful resource helpful thank pc world seem intimidating know something better knowledge
dont mention probably integrated vega 8 graphic 5700g counted value since come cpu also unremarkable performance httpscapcpartpickercomguide basic build including httpscapcpartpickercomguidentffrhentrylevelamdgamingbuild would eviscerate best buy hp pc game performance rsuggestapc would place go absolutely dont want build one
perspective see intimidating trust isnt like formula learn school eventually end using rest year first tough get know basic step get confident time mostly knowing whats market right building easy plus get help almighty google reddit issue afaik rbuildapcforme full list component assemble might nice info compare custom build prebuilt specially price performance custom basically destroys class willing pay morefor actually good crappy one prebuilts various reason like time excessive fear messing nice day
9800x3d terrible cpu gaming without dedicated gpu could probably play old game low resolution wouldnt recommend
pretty bad probably play game run toaster old game probably fine go gog start looking non demanding emulation probably fine give idea according test techpowerup 37x worse 1060
wouldnt recommend thought playing ps2 game
try see playing portal 2 medium setting fine wasnt ideal gaming experience worked
personally wouldnt enjoy play game reduced resolution terrible frame rate id rather something else game get gpu everybodys different though another commenter said always give shot see worth playing

check gpu even fit case
contemplating ryzen 7 5700x3d maybe 5800x3d think thats best could mobo thought difference would make
big difference good idea
cant get 5800x3d without paying nose one stopped producing back 5700x3d still widely available performance close 5800x3d unless already pretty decent heatsinkaio probably also upgrade x3d part run hotter nonx3d version ram fine since machine open drop 2tb nvme drive game big could spring youd squeeze 4090 going 7800x3d 9800x3d am5 thatll huge jump cost
appreciate tip 5700x3d ordered
motherboards fine am4 cpu 56005600x compatible bios update would recommend boot drive right hard drive yeah upgrade ssd already ssd boot drive maybe bigger one able store least commonly used game
5700x3d best option 99 5600x good deal

case support 390mm long card 335mm good there place mount 360mm aio cooler good plus product sitehttpswwwmsicompccasemagpanom100rpz even show aio mounted thats regarding case compatibility
thank im new wasnt sure looking
get 5700x3d
yeah couldnt find local store normally buy closest 3 hour drive one way settled 5700x 5700x3d still production wait till come back wait discount sale come back locally
lot people get aliexpress got mine amazon
okay refresher make x3d better x also wait sale decrease price buy manufactured least 1 year right
idea manufacturerd x3d new 3d vache like 3x cache base x version help immensely gaming
make sure extra l3 cache reduces minimum fps see less fps variation
improves minimum average fps overall increase
looked pcbenchmark showed 1 increase speed performed less aspect 5700x substantial price increase trying wrap head around
forgot mention play much fps game
standardheight slot standardheight card able fit without removing component link video image another site imgur
upload pic imgur link post
added vid ty
changed thank
httpsimgurcomrvlhovo remove screw
take cover thats interfering there screw back case put cover back pcie device installed
omg thank much seems simple
thankyou would stuck forever simple
sound like baller setup suggesting cost isnt big factor may well get 5090 able get good money current 4090 offset upgrade cost personally find trading pretty rewarding get something fasterbetter clean closet old stuff something value future trade year road
sure bro upgrade want
would say youre even reaching max fps cant go 120hz would need upgrade seems unnecessary 4090 nearly 5090 every way except price youre gaining essentially zero simultaneously stressing psu
yes usually let pas 3 4 generation buying new gpu honestly selling 4090 would let get latest powerful card cost 5070 im really tempted however money big problem dont like burn sake thats im pretty torn buying new gpu thanks opinion
maybe explained poorly screen 240hz screen 4090 limited 120hz doesnt display port 21 buying 5090 would unlock 240hz thanks new port therefore boot old game capable 240fps would actually use screen maximum potential 4090 regardless game limited 50 psu problem ive got 1200w im worried ive seen benchmark 5090 seems 30 faster raster 4k considering screen dual 4k probably 30 could come handy
tough call id probably find stuff sell offset cost needed sleep better get buying top end gear holding long time 3090 still little 3 year old work great still fully paid etherium mining late 2021 early 2022 feel got free likely sell summer pickup used 4090 5090 depending upgrade cost im waiting 5090 field tested make sure solid spend big 1080ti 4 year also great gpu initial reviewer saying 5090 overkill game foreseeable future much sound like 5 year card reason would really need 5090 today aiml work help walk back edge cliff
well case long dead right snag 5090 could pretty good upgrade price wont debate merit 4090 5090 price wise xx90 level youre super worried price case legitimate hardware reason upgrade personally id worried would sell 4090 miss opportunity buy 5090 leaving backup card money burning hole wallet
luckily ill sell 4090 ill able get 5090 guy who buying card friend friend therefore ability put condition ill try buy 5090 mrsp ill able get one ill sell 4090 otherwise ill stick happy thanks take matter
yup good luck hope youre successful
question fan need thermally throttled issue fan going full tiltat static speed time
sleeping electronics compartment bed dont want fan running 24hr day boat etc
wouldnt ramping ramping far annoying static noise simple fan controller manually adjust speed fan run inverter run
fan keeping awake concern pick inline resistor slow point theyd silenteffectively silent youre worried something 247 circuitry enable kind automatic adjustment would also turned time introduce complexity form automatic monitoring potentiometer system probably hobby board like raspberry piarduino would prone hazard always running fan would physical switch turn onoff would would complicate circuit setup simply find speed quiet enough bother night
inverter would used mostly day could throttle say 40 80 would best external 12 volt thermally controlled switch definitely exists outside application pc fan unit seem 4 pin one pin supposed regulate speed already believe
4 pin 12v ground tach pwm typically pc use 4th pwm pin regulate speed however still regulate fan regulating voltage aka 6v half speed work go speed fluctuation though would drive nut ignore static fan noise fine noise constantly changing becomes annoying noticeable
guess could take power ground run external temp switch forget throttling part sound simple
need gpu upgrade pick depends budget
notice performance different every game program application tell cpu gpu relationship isnt static universal one asking good combination entirely dependent workload use context provided combination hardware ideal someone depending situation
depends resolution even 1080p little bottleneck nothing massive upgrade
shouldnt bad however consider upgrading 5700x3d future
would recommend im thinking upgrading ryzen 7 5600x
ryzen 7 5700x
early coronacrypto boom way way worse paid 3000 eur 3090s 3d rendering need worse yet could forget budget mid range system full year right plenty decent value option available simply didnt exist back unless lucked simply want best always expensive especially card also bought professional could take chance hope ai bubble burst due deepseek hopefully suppressing price higher end nvidia model wouldnt count happening anytime soon
whats system right might thought around light upgrading waiting next couple year picked used 5800x3d cap am4 system im also less impressed upcoming card given leak rumour im planning squatting rtx 3080 longer
considering wd sn330 100 wd sn770 120 20 difference worth price
yes theyre plug play
buy 2 stick 64 gb kit dont try run 4 ddr5 stick clocked

thanks thinking well
speed need workload best subjective idea best referring aware gen5 pretty pointless people
hmm mostly use pc gaming also content creation nothing like complex render stuff like loading game moving around large footage file heard gen5 pretty limited standard person heard advantage especially large file thought id look
loading game irrelevant game dont noticeably benefit gen5 nvme compared gen3 even sata ssd situation transferring file one drive another going rely slower drive meaning single gen5 drive pointless drive slower unless sustained sequential workload niche requirement high amount throughput dont really see benefit gen5 really want gen5 would work fine isnt best since result also dont context component check gen5 m2 slot motherboard share lane gpu gen5 pushed market primarily widen margin wasnt implemented ideal manner platform
ahh right thanks def might change thing last part interested initially thinking worst case scenario gen5 ssd wouldnt worse gen4 one said gen5 sharing lane gpus make think might much trouble could tell im able check thatd fantastic thanks help
check motherboard spec page manual lane shared stated
worth cost id patient save money
old card died perfectly happy better card allow play game anything couldnt already doubt could spend money get tiny upgrade wait generation two get meaningful upgradewhen likely would need upgrade anyway say wait
love xt price got 25 year ago wouldnt invest 7000 series given amd already saying getting fsr4 edit also 2 week shouldnt matter purchase last year
may worth warranty
worth however use 300 2nd gpu use ai fg upscaling land 6800xt 7800xt used boom
already saying getting fsr4 thats half true said initially release new gen working backporting good possible older card card getting fsr 4 support itd xtx
thats possible tech doesnt exist
thats true accurate way put guess accurately dont like idea extending commitment product line idea maybe
oh doescheck app called lossless scaling choose gpu use render frame
thats good point
doesnt seem working reliably user even reported working specific mobos appropriate connectivity mixed result seems useful laptop user
game video fighting computer resource could try set priority browser process higher limit frame rate game lower watching video
thing happening game heavy impacting game dont got bored trying find right setting make work u go control panel make sure vsynch ur display rate second high thing like sorry cant proper help hopefully new gpu trick
well first thing check suddenly make system lag cpu ram gpu
thank replying even game like tft dont require lot resource still happens also pc supposed one thsinsould happen
im bit pc dummy lol
happens well game intel 10900k rtx 4090 game play run fast possible even way monitor refresh rate cause something bottleneck performance even game generally doesnt require lot resource could use lot running super high frame rate game run higher frame rate monitor refresh rate help improve latency unless youre playing competitive fps probably wont make difference point youd probably want avoid video secondary monitor reduce distraction anyway
need save money want budget option getting used part even better around 1000usd getting am5 build better opinion
thanks mate one question btw choose 1240012400f 5600 would choose mew build
cpu 5700x better 5600 planning buy 5700x3d best choise am4
id say doesnt really matter two cpu basically paper might upgrade r7 5700x3d got am4 motherboard performance upgrade big long term might matter much 12400 igpu cost probably however need get cheapest motherboard id go r5 5600 a320 a520 allows use xmpmemory profile ram h motherboard would actually decide motherboard price
usually check crystal disk info run benchmark
id wait new card see well fare also pcie gen irrelevant 5090 loses 14 performance pcie 3 v 5 doesnt matter
want upgrade amd gpus id recommend waiting till march see rx 9070 xt brings table
2080s still capable card 1440p dlss4 making balanced even quality preset quite decent resolution unless game make feel performance subpar id recommend waiting bit longer id wait 9070xt really want upgrade 7900xtx great card uncertain whether receive fsr4 support big improvement fsr23 even wont work well rdna4
right answer wait
go best amd gpu afford probably go 7900xt since abit cheaper
didnt know backwards compatible little there reason think thanks
thinking since right around corner see price new top model well hopefully still using pcie4 slot pcie5
bit struggling ark survival ascended everybody since really need optimizing bit human upgraded cpu ram havent tested new hardware im probably gon na end waiting new card seems general consensus thanks reply
always
wouldnt matter 5090 performance difference extremely minimal
get gpu riser maybe
either gpu riser riser tplink card riser cable connects pcie device slot
got nzxt h6 flow
9800x3d apparently back stock 480 msrp frequently u check rbuildapcsales get 6000cl30 ram 6400 still isnt guaranteed work box performance difference tiny practically nonexistent x3d cpu x670 choice motherboard especially price seems odd unless need lane get b850 pcie gen 50x16 x870 feel like spending oir b500 dont care pcie gen 50x16 psu overpriced equally solid 850w gold psus less id personally go cheaper phantom spirit nonevo preferably nonse smaller aio itll likely quiet time either
av1 encoding support good get streaming personally id wait rtx 50 series release
appreciate feedback
id upgrade old cpu instead 5070ti likely wont much uplift 4070ti anyways better get proper cpu upgrade
100 true going ryzen 7 7800x3d ryzen 7 9800x3d would better option
used 4090 priced right would better buying 5080 new less confirmed 4090 outperforms 5080 vram however youre playing 1440p might necessarily need 4090s power another option consider would used 4080s alternatively could consider 7900 xtx often available much cheaper price dont need ray tracing
honestly thats probably better idea even get 5090 launch
id also consider aoc q24g2e ip panel there q27g2e va panel q27g2s prefer ip want 27 specifically good mix pricecolour accuracy

civ overall performance likely barely change additional core typically useful resolving ai action game may faster term time needed resolve round fps likely wouldnt change enough make upgrade worthwhile also 13600k already pretty capable think early upgrade
wouldnt upgrade unless youre noticing performance issue know upgrade fix id also avoid intel 13th 14th gen cpu theyve serious issue would fry time
much money throw getting gpu also digital design software going use
tbh dont really want go 300 gpu im aware expensive gpu market could open spending 350 needed software adobe suite use
yeah likely outdated bios tested everything else bios flash work
got great ps also hot garbage psu youre looking recommendable country dont use 230v youre country 230v theyre ok great id probably still go corsair rmx silverstone psus personal go tos
montech titan gold made cwt reviewedtested really well appear discontinued showing stock anywhere find dont know much line
beginner build also really cpu dead platform 3060 isnt worth
think great start probably get bit oomph runway upgrade tweaking bit cpu old socket motherboard wanted upgrade year would need buy new motherboard cpu likely ram id recommend getting am5 platform something like ryzen 7600 asrock steel legend b650 32gbof gskill flare x5 6000 total would save bit give basically performance gaming intel would win bit productivity likely enough unless actual professional also come wraith cooler fine could easily replaced like thermal take peerless assassin phantom spirit saving would let pop extra 80100 gpu possible find used 7900 gre see 400450 otherwise maybe try find 7800xt could also try snag used 4000 series id try get 1216gb vram wait march new amd card might perfect idea pricing bit fiasco 9070 really 450 look like good choice
budget
old cpu much ram slow gpu needlessly fast likely overpriced nvme overpriced motherboard overpriced cooling get cpu make sense way overkill overpriced psu bad build gaming spending money everywhere doesnt matter id see rbuildapcforme help
im paying 250 3060
im going streamingvideo production thats im going intel cpu heard best
think great start get trying supportive honestly single component build worth keeping sake value performance
10001200
im getting cpu 289 gpu 279 ram 150
psu high year plan upgrading gpu
cant post reason
get am5 system ryzen 5 7600 youll easily afford 7800xt
8gb gpu ewaste 2025 need least 12gb year next year probably 16
intel quicksync advantage work video codecs supported gpu get video production professionally often
yeah great start itll build computer id probably go am5 get 7800xt use cheap air cooler grab decent 850w gold tier b get 2 cheaper nvme drive im sure need cpu learn video audio editing software youre learning unless youre massive amount productivity loss i9 7600x 7700 gon na like minute day aka bathroom break
mean save little needed hurry
spend money way better 30060 4yearold entry level gpu get 2x16gb ddr5 80 cheaper cpu thats platform thats dead save money part get good gpu u budget
professionally learning professional want spec
yeah great start itll build computer well standard fair enough p agree build suggestion otherwise caveat productivity
im real low paying job relying tip get pc go paycheck ill go debt rate im take year buy everything
im u budget around 10001200 im videomusic production gaming
fair enough probably add post mentioned gaming productivity ram core important 280 12900k solid deal productivitygaming build indeed need core videoaudio professionally hobby
audio hobby looking go professional know aiming high friend starting channel together he already pretty known
issue stick 16 youll fine
yes okay also brand matter speed youre good even speed pc run lowest speed stick
good question first depends platform dont know changed amd 7000 platform came using 4 dimm meant significant reduction data transfer rate something like 6000 3600 sometimes dont really care transfer rate need handle large file running multiple virtual machine far know intel didnt limitation intuition make sure pair channel usually using alternating slot system probably use worst timing two set time test memory test sometimes available directly bios analyze need going gaming 2x16 probably enough need data driven heavy workload go lot
vga mb lit
thanks
speed right
check gpu make sure fully plugged pcie slot correct power cable
picture brand different speed different timing
restart pc light gone okay
probably
im gon na upgrade ram put 16gb 4 make higher
mean add 2 higher ram
first use 2 monitor keep current one use lcd one schooldesktop stuff oled consuming content said current gen qdoled panel seem resistant burn monitor 32 oled pretty good pricing right u dell one particular cheap id see country httpswwwredditcomrbuildapcsalescomments1ib8efnmonitoralienwareaw3225qf324k240hzqdoled also look msi mag 321upx little budget least u sure better alternative want good current gen oled though
oh yea add want use new monitor 2 year hahaha
pretty much lot newer qd oled panel definitely resistant model basic way reduce burn use second monitor static productivity oled gamingwatching stuff
bought msi mag 274qrf qd e2 honestly couldnt happier color amazing usbc port charge laptop since monitor use work 180 hz enough play shooter mostly cost 250 27
bought gigabyte m27q time ago jump 1440p huge around 350 got find cheaper would recommend though might better option still think look looking rtings smart everyone good
4060 better 3060 full stop dont get 3060
yes without doubt
whats price 4060 better
4060 perfectly good card vacuum value sentiment mostly revolved around price release price performance compared option metric behind therefore good value nothing wrong card price went lot since absolutely better card 3060 simple decision cost arc b580 cost youre might also interesting option youre looking card around bracket
newer always better price brainer
budget 7800xt would work
first one would cpu 5700x3dmake sure update bios upgrading see performs apex cpu intensive game maybe thats need
around 700 72821 usdollar
wouldnt cpu bottleneck

yes would
httpsdepcpartpickercomlistyz6b4mhttpsdepcpartpickercomlistyz6b4m first upgrade cpu think need fps upgrade gpu 7700xt flex budget 7800xt worth gpu upgrade limited ryzen 5 3600 cpu priority
also tell watage psu rated
processor would recommend fit 7800xt
find
5700x3d best one get perfect 7800xt
open side panel say side might remove cable
general cpu recommendation amd dont risk hardware flaw intel 1314th gen amd x3d chip offer much gaming performance much lower heat level get full performance without watercooler overall idea leaving gpu later solid youll get performance cpu upgrade
there really point asking feedback purchasing use dont worry update bios latest version asap seller didnt prevent degredation stability issue cpu good choice good value imo monitor make somewhat ok least probably build something similarly priced 4090 5090 9800x3d instead
4200 seems high computer beast
appreciate feedback extra cash burning hole pocket oh well dont want build went easiest route either way im excited
considering monitor 900 retail im going assume actual pc around 3200 comparable amd build built 7900xtx came 3 year ago similar price 6tb storage bit expensive imo guess thats premium pay someone custom build im thrilled 1200 graphic card 16gb vram build run anything 4k 60fps highultra setting thats went amd 7950x3d 7900xtx 24gb vram gen personally probably wouldve waited till 5000 series nvidia card came couple month though since building new pc scratch also intel 13th 14th high end cpu reported oxidation issue intel claim fixed problem removed potential problem chip circulation nobody taking intels word aware start issue
personally would recommend latest microcode pick one around march microcode tune pc manually
there really point asking feedback purchasing use dont worry came comment exactly people ask buying stuff like looking gas station car gas
thats awesome thanks tip
yes good stuff send
far cpu id say get 9000 series new intel 200 series unless already cpu also cooler get nice 360mm watercooler corsair pretty good 1200 watt fine
bring psu 1000w ram 32gb spend difference getting 9800x3d cpu instead assuming strict budget dont go ahead get 9800x3d leave everything else there reason cpu anything less best tier everything else
need go aio cooling he getting fractal design torrent torrent excels air cooling built specifically
likely get away 750w would probably recommend undervolting 14900k anyway reduce temperature insane power consumption power limitingundervolting 4080s would also good idea thats important newer rm750e come 12vhpwr cable dont need adapter came gpu still get new psu go 850w atx30pcie50 get native connector
plug one 8 pin cable cpu freeing port gpu cable additional cpu power port irrelevant unless overclocking subambient cooling
come 16 pin dual 8 pin cable one youre referring would enough power gpu requiring use three 8 pin 8 pin cable
psu come two 8 pin 8 pin cable labelled cpu one 8 pin 8 pin cable labelled pcie one 8pin 2 8 pin splitter cable labelled pcie 4080 specifies use three separate 8pin 8 pin cable splitter cpu pcie cable interchangeable possible way think possible use 1 2 splitter cable labelled pcie cpu three others two 8 pin cpu single pcie 8 pin gpu doesnt seem right edit also come 16 pin dual 8 pin cable compatible gpu sure deliver power need gpu need three separate 8 pin cable
come 12 pin dual 8 pin cable one youre referring yeah thats one labeled 450w thats plenty power gpu three 8 pin cable required use adapter
use 16 pin cable enough
cant see 450w label look answer use cable gpu keep two 8 pin cpu cable cpu give try appreciate help
upgrade gpu cpu still good enough maybe get 7800 xt 4070s play 1440p reduce potential cpu bottleneck really need gpu 10 year old basically anything upgrade rasterization performance
1660 super theyll perform basically difference used cooler temp noise impacted model also factory overclocked doesnt really matter
standardized afaik previous matx motherboard fit matx board
think exact measure old one 244mmx228mm new one 244x244
matx like old matx
dont anything add want say sweet help son pc good day good luck maam
definitely beef ram others said window reset go along way solve lagginess older system well
replace gpu old good assuming 1050 thats
think game play help steer u upgrade look first said looked full spec pc 128gb ssd game fit there 1tb hdd drive slow console started coming ssds default game development moved assuming theyre going get type performance lot modern game choke trying run hard drive also mentioned new pc christmas let look upgrade carry new pc 1tb ssd pretty cost effective two type nvme ssd look like stick gum sata ssd 25 little box like half stack playing card size nvme drive significantly faster whereas sata ssd old tech still much faster hdd looked motherboard pc look like there 1 nvme slot pc upper right corner next big bundle cable power something rule using nvme ssd likely operating system require additional step hardware swap empty free game nvme slot use look lower right corner motherboard there metal plate inbetween plate giant cable attached motherboard two black plug l inside sata port one might use hard drive itll flat cable could add another sata ssd upgrade could also move new future pc probably best glowup give pc 20 add another 1x 8gb stick ddr4 ram two physical type one laptop desktop make sure get one desktop perfect world best pair kit get speedbrand eh worth use case without knowing plan future pc thats far id go new graphic card would wonder dont see much point getting one future pc one may one thats much better
like deadpool said upgrade ram window 10 burn ton memory add antivirus ect able buy 32 gig set memory less 150 even less go kingston dell unless son running heavy cpu task memory really make big difference deep dive registry clean garbage left behind deleted program stuff isnt used still take system memory
whole system lagging try running something like malwarebytes see malware running background also 3rd party antivirus running like norton use lot resource arent really necessary window defender also open task manager rightclick toolbar task manager go startup tab see there stuff loading window need speeding pc isnt super difficult take little bit work knowhow
know game play 8gb ram sound low little ram could result stutter far cheapest component get good upgrade
slightly different opion id say rather pouring money outdated system id suggest something like 250 modern cpu integrated gpu run lap around 74001050 play modern game already come 16gb ram well fast nvme ssd going suggestion upgrade first opened thread httpswwwamazoncomcomputerswindowsdisplaydesktopbluetoothdpb0bqhbwpyxhttpswwwamazoncomcomputerswindowsdisplaydesktopbluetoothdpb0bqhbwpyx
thank yeah original stuff want get new pc cant moment asking ram got wrong one ive since opened look know im dealing shortterm upgrade ill get new one christmas
yea get ram dirt cheap nowadays always buy second hand needed plus plug play dont need set anything ddr4 ram quick google search make sure put ram stick correct slot someall motherboards slot prefer 2 8gb stick ram enough ram game thats use play game problem
also dont mix ram type use exact model ram together
say max 32gb using google lens found exact ram thats would advise buying two new ram one exact
1 8gb stick would buy exact budget cheap buy
ye probably get something around 600 650w always good breathing room
plug spec pcpartpickercom see estimated wattage psu ideally 20 headroom
2013 due replacement psu failure bad part replacing anyways get bit wattage
replace would get least 650w psu
old underpowered would advise change even getting second hand psu 12 year life better next one used 10 year get 850 good brand new warranty super urgent lookout great deal
dont know power spike arent causing problem
time upgrade probably age capacity dont want wait psu die similar cpu even got 3070 upper limit though comfortable mindful plan future upgrade soon personally moved 750w upgraded am5
fair pc part picker peg max 530w
nope 2013 old psu better replacement
nope 2013 old psu better replacement
time 650w 750w unit
personally would get good 1440p 165180hz ip monitor pc would handle game resolution next couple year build new pc 5700x3d aint worth tbh
monitor also rx6700xt1440p fine almost everything fsr ultra quality 1440p look great
monitor
get cpu first later monitor really pick one
also need better card monitor 1440p resolution much demanding 1080p would upgrade would benefit start cpu gpu monitor end
get 1440p first get 5700x3d need upscaling 1080p
monitor unless get higher end gpu cpu limited game currently play cpu upgrade wont make enough difference justify cost
5700x3d still production easily acquired easy upgrade 5600 able sold offset cost try using radeons vsr see like people notice difference others swear close identical native higher resolution monitor basically render game higher monitor resolution downsamples monitor resolution get detail dsr nvidia equivalent software one best money subjective sound like lot people would prefer monitor would go cpu value higher 1 low using format common standard medium game well decade
1440p massive upgrade 1080p youd notice huge improvement
run 165hz 1440p monitor 5600x 6750xt

im gon na running rtx 5070 650w psu 4070 super 30 watt less 5070 ran fine returned card 850w enough
850 enough 1000 straight unnecessary
nvidia recommends minimum 650 watt total system power based pc configured ryzen 9 9950x processor rest component powerhungry normal need otherwise 650 watt enough less powerhungry cpu might even okay less 650 course get much want minimum recommended ive heard get psu 15x expect expect actual full load power consumption pcpartpicker tell theoretical maximum rough estimate example see techspots total system consumption measurement gaming httpswwwtechspotcomreview2793nvidiageforcertx4070tisuperpowerconsumptionhttpswwwtechspotcomreview2793nvidiageforcertx4070tisuperpowerconsumption
else system im still running seasonic focus platinum 850w power 5800x3d 4090 calculation peak draw around 675w total 3x ssd 1x hard drive 7 fan pump put 80 full load without stress test figure much lower find 120w cpu range 380400w gpu range normal gaming plenty overhead power supply make meaningful noise silence based pc even load said next rebuild include new power supply probably 1000w range want atx30 support feeling next gpu may equal higher power 4090

thank
4070s stronger 5070 lol
thank
see thank much ill using intel i9 14900k cpu alongside 5070 ill take look link provided seems agree 650w enough thanks help
similar focus gold 850w connect pc ups also synology ds916 4xhdd 38 monitor connected yet gaming see 600w load everything
top head plan intel i9 14900k cpu alongside rtx 5070 ram corsair vengeance 32gb ddr5 storage corsair 2tb something 600 core western digital blue something 1tb
u pixel count graph without frame gen average 5 faster 4070s
14900k powerhungry id say get 750 watt
thanks extra insight tend max review load component double check 20 overhead thermal really need get ups main pc
curious there specific reason 14900k ask gaming seem overkill wrong way lot data work make sense need data performance make sure latest bios patch degradation personally would recommend slight volt since seem really push early death 100w power usage id like see
alright ill look 750w 850w see price like there much difference ill go 850 safe otherwise ill definitely consider 750w supply
im going 14900k gaming pc also require run industry numerical cfd solver could running thousand calculation dozen flow condition
could elaborate meant volt push death
yes high possibility would work basic jedec speed
thats going work am5 motherboard ram least 200 cheapest possible cpu would 7500f aliexpress 150 4060 around 300 thats would already almost entire budget case storage psu cooler
sn770 go
try look sk hynix platinum p41 efficient fast high tbw 750 tbw 1 tb model
expensive 3 em tho would worth extra price influx
believe twice price current budget sir
faster version sn580 like 20 ill say stick sn580 never go wrong wd
list best sn580 one decent endurance
im inclined towards best price performance tho would extra buck worth getting ssd kinda im asking tbh
upgrading get get new gpu future 5600g might weak handle budget push 56006600 600usd
board might issue got cpu upgrade bios wan na go b450 rather look msi variant support bios flashback personally prefer a520 lineup offer full pcie 30 entire board fav one would gigabyte a520i ac itx board got solid vrm 2 hdmi 1 dp output asus tuf gaming a520mplus wifi would second choice still want keep support msi b550m provdh wifi board exactly cheapest get money least perspective need ram honestly would rather go 32gb share memory igpu ram speed 3600mhz benefit igpu performance running non igpu build either pico module 160 200 w fsp 200w sfx power supply got cheap work fine office highest got roughly 120w total consumption pushing thing limit
wont buy high end gpu probably something equovalent 3060
extremely sorry familiar much terminology used simple term explain motherboard good others mentioned thanks taking time
yea 6600 level push else 5600g kinda waste money
bios refers file need installed onto motherboard able use newer processor update bios need either access bios booting feature called bios flashback button use usb drive file update hideous process rather go newer board already support older board usually need supported processor installed get access bios many older board dont button said look msi motherboard want go bios update route b450 a520 refers chipset used mb newer b450 likely support 5600g box would looking passive cooled vrm voltage regulator module also us higher quality point think might better looking prebuilt system
suggest buying instead 5600g
56006600 budget allows

possibly problem slot motherboard youre putting gpus troubleshooting expensive dont extra part could find way try another mobo part could helpful
first built actually using gigabyte b650 board returned got msi board currently use year issue enabled setting bios fixed mostly past year also got different ram gpu getting msi board finding fix worked bit
also gpu power light fan spinning vga debug light cpu ram light
well tried another slot even though top x16 x4 slot worked immediately post figure want actually get x16 need new mobo order one rma decide screw let try top slot worked logical understanding would work x4 slot also x16 slot refuse work x16 slot begin far confusing frustrating build ive ever done
sound like slot bad connection isnt consistent solid youre warranty look replacing mobo mean could way fix beyond give advice troubleshoot find broken part solution replace
guess find extremely unlikely bad slot gigabyte board started one think ill hold replacing board rebuilding whole thing bit unless start keep acting
probably upgrade time
yeah probably
card state overall length case also state maximum length gpu fit regarding hdds mounting varies case layout look one dont interfere gpu area

ryzen 9950x3d dropped amd likely meet need one best production cpu 1000 one top gaming cpu extra l3 cache youll happy 4070ti super amazing card
9950x soon launched 9950x3d extra gaming perf dont get 4070ti super yet 5070ti launch msrp february
cheap different
9950x 9950x3d soon sure exactly guess max month
depending renderer quite require cuda limit nvidia card cpu look 7700x upwards
youre specific scale important say render 3d scene talking small room entire city quite relevant latter may want consider amd instead cost effectve choice vram important nvidia decent amount high end card asked simulation talking simple thing scale well 816cores talking demanding simulation best threadripper cpu want something complex simulation id argue youll looking towards 32 core threadripper 7970x cheaper 24core threadripper 7960x
much longer till drop sound really cool bit important something soon since need work
launch available msrp doubt snagging one wont easy
saying consider amd gpu instead nvidia better vram use maya occasionally tap unreal blender 3d scene maybe like medium large roomscene simulation like cloth hair fluid effect like fire water apologize vagueness unsure everything withs spec pc
couldnt tell exactly 7950x3d 9950x 9900x amd also really great alternative perform great gaming cpu well intel 14900k probably best performancegaming cpu controversy recently 13th 14th gen cpu rightly basically cooking death appears fixed issue youd make sure got new intel chip went route personally id avoid intel unless price lot better
well see 30 day
since quality psu four 62 pin likely fine getting second hand 4080 might better since performance upgrade likely quite small
live state need consider microcenters amd bundle price good ignore

well 9700x better gaming 12900k little better multimedia task 30 id get better gaming cpu plus am5 system room upgrade future 12900k intel already moved onto arrowlake cpu line dead 14th gen
5700x3d current mb much cost effective upgrade am5
update motherboard bios slap 5700x3d cost effective upgrade
cpu sure get deal
bought corsair 3500x amazing airflow buy argb version come 3 fan
check following case price range fractal design torrent lancool 207 lancool 216 antex flux pro fractal design north phanteks g500a g400a
went quiet pure base 501 airflow bought one additional fan looking solid case check montech air 903 max dont care glass panel thats probably best priceairflow ratio imo best looking

youre thinking single rank v dual rank usually indeed visible ram chip one two side frequency timing dual rank indeed faster allows rank interleaving difference ddr5 rather small compared ddr4 though saw video explaining basically surmised ddr5 really worth getting 64gb absolute nonsense 2x16gb fine difference small x3d cpu mitigate pretty much difference ram performance anyway need get 64gb unless need capacity uajajniwij28sn3njs
thank ill definitely look
thank much ill definitely change bit
thank much
oh thats good know thank yea didnt fully understand last sentence really decided sick thats saving right
click sound likely power supply current protection kicking would start post full spec list best
shouldnt want high speed value stability sell old kit get new 2x32gb 6000mt cl30 kit instead mixing ram kit make even harder run stable higher speed
still fixed heard sweetspot changed 6400mt newer chipsi 7900x
ive half dozen 9000 series chip come hand one could 6400 11 6000 sweet spot going change time soon isnt matter fixing nothing broken run default speed like theyre supposed
6400mt bit performanca easy get stable ryzen 7000 ryzen 9000 bit better 6400mt reliably achieved gear 1 huge performance jump id rather stick 6000mt stability
thought usually max ram timing improve platform matures thanks
9000 series incremental step imc really didnt change fact think new 800series board improved people getting better speed
ah ok see thanks lot

much complicated video editing much cheap without removing cpu core another note cpu cooler purpose
went list thanks reply 1 cpu 6 core count enough gaming wrt 14 core count core i5 2 motherboard thats good suggestion matx future proof 3 memory thats better suggestion 4 video card would much like buy gain performance lost amd processor
basic video editing mainly using davinci adding cpu cooler intentional doesnt add much cost anyway right
cpu 6 core count enough gaming wrt 14 core count core i5 cpu similar better i5 yes 6 core definitely enough plus upgrade ryzen 9 9900x ryzen 7 9800x3d later weak motherboard thats good suggestion matx future proof matx form factor case cheaper am5 socket better proofed lga 1700 video card would much like buy gain performance lost amd processor losing performance one suggestion wary teamgroup everything make super high quality
35 good air cooler 45 also want different paste
yeah doesnt add much cooling either planning cool cpu
okk yea ik form factor im little biased towards atx form team group isnt high quality better stick corsair right
region good cooler 20
sorry wasnt clear im adding cpu cooler sure didnt mention coz cooler bit cheaper region
ssd think get kingston ssds relatively cheap probably fine id check review decide
understand guy comment good build want keep 1400 usd cost probably downgrade gpu save money thats wish
ok ill look
would performance drop noticeable
depends much downgrade
youre 1080p 5070 5060ti minimal downgrade 40 series card since doubt youll able get 50 msrp
make sense ill look around
im fine 40 series card price drop new series launch there news 40 series production stopped
check comment
seems good
depends software youre running
fine
nah fine wont issue unless youre playing top end cpu gobbler
seems good already 5700x3d buying different kit ddr4 ram like considering might well go am5 dont cpu yet fine though minmaxing
may overkill 1080p get 1440p panel would actually able use 7900xt capable especially get 32gb ram
gaming
yew ryzen 5 3600 replaced cpu kept ram motherboard
kind gaming either way youll get 100 fps even heavy title run i3 12100f 4070 7900gre
country budget
indonesia budget 25000000 idr
buy different case install window use key think buying another company 110 cost work buy used gpu
suggest different case
able find cheaper one
thats agp pcie old wifi card lol wrong pci agp time lol knew agp
pci card pcie pci thats incompatible
pci need pcie completely incompatible
ddr4 ram dirt cheap right could probably get another 2x8gb model penny upgrade 32 gb unless motherboard 2 ram slot otherwise definitely gpu cpu still fine unless professional workflow requiring beefy cpu 1080 ti still bad mean first part setup become obsolete game require raytracing capability one notable game think indiana jones also new doom announced basically time trend upgrade cpu youd upgrade motherboard ram would big switch without really notable performance change gaming want upgrade anyway 2 year desperately want something point upgrading something gpu like 4070 super something willing wait 2 month 5070 new amd card bigger picture
1080ti goat time coming end hasnt ended already think probly best thing upgrade atm idk good wait new 5070 9070xt invidiaamd youre budget find b580 close msrp250 believe good upgrade guess want future proofing 1080p least dont mind spending 400ish something like 7800xt even 7700xtwhich serve im writing somewhat assumption youre u youre europe like prepare pay youd see smth like microcenter newegg vat bi dont think need cpu upgrade want one platform get 5700x3d
exactly looking thank yeah ive eyeing different gpus 4070 4070s 7800 7700xt im happy wait newer card either invest hope theyll drop cost card significantly oh ram thing ive drummed pc builder 4x slot worse replacing 2x slot quad channel way worse dual channel id much rather slap another 2x8gb claim overstated
feared might approaching day retire ye olde faithful 1080 ti youre right day numbered im sort budget im massively rush wait couple month see market go new card release hope drop price little shouldve clarified im uk yeah feel price consider 5700x3d time even still considering think realistically 5800x fine moboramcpu year
common misconception one fell victim cleared couple month ago normal consumer level main board indeed dont quadchannel support number stick number channel run two stick dual channel dual channel board board nowadays also run 4 stick dual channel mean 2 stick per channel quadchannel would running 4 stick separate channel quadchannel mostly found high end board mainly board designed server usage case whether use 4 stick 2 stick mostly irrelevant run dual channel either way make sure new ram similar current ram speed latency etc best buy stick already
hey im 5600 performance wise gaming tooo far behind 5800x running ff7 rebirth finewell see go allegedly optimized full launch mh wild xp important note devs develop console cpu ps5 3600 3700 equivalent unless get ps6 next year fine
thanks clarifying always something thats confused fair bit case think ill grab couple extra stick ram wait gpu release end month super soon im mistaken since theyre 30 couple ddr4s thank much help
til didnt realise console cpu want say substandard think thats bit harsh though make sense theyre top line cost implication seemingly cpuintensive scenario cause fps loss console
yeah funniest thing ps5 pro doesnt better cpu one ps5
listed two cpu cooler personally think thermalright better value option really comfortably best value cpu cooling solution would also suggest getting thermalright tl c12c case fan get 5 pack much cost one quiet fan personally otherwise comment im currently planning similar build similar budget weve made different decision certain place nothing cant put personal preference
asus expansive gpu would take oc one msi gigabyte good luck get better motherboard get would go x870 msi tomahawk example 2 cooler
oh forgot remove cooler master thermalright one planning buying thank tip regarding fan wasnt sure also dont know many need 3 enough found 3pack quite cheap
price arent yet 5080 placeholder dont know difference model ill likely go one cheaper one come motherboard one recommended 371 double one list worth yeah forgot remove one cooler fixed
plan 3x 120mm front intake 120mm back exhaust 120mm top exhaust id expect 2x intake front 1x exhaust back fine case may come case fan use well havent checked case key principle aim one intake fan exhaust fan give positive pressure help reduce dust build
would suggest gigabyte b850 aorus elite wifi7 im going dont need feature x870 board save bit money understanding research mobo picked ultimately fine though
yes expansive need future proof high end pc would go x870 otherwise motherboard good gigabyte x870 eagle wifi 7 cheaper need feature x870 worth look spec interested
thank good know case doesnt come fan could add 2 fan make 5 theyre pretty cheap
try rtings
google motherboards model qvl
yeah know ram stick qvl list saw someone motherboard got stick listed worked wondering someone knew
meant work together return ram
1060 saving new one rn played cyber punk week fairly low setting certainly rt probably getting average 55fps dont think youll getting high ultra new game especially new game far gpucpu heavy cant even play poe2 pc really suck try look benchmark test see anyone game interested good luck
dont recommend cant afford anything else gon na serviceable game 2023 youll getting like 40 fps though hit 60 lowering setting gon na well 40 series way better goal 30 series might serviceable rx 6600xt fine 6700xt6750xt find reasonable price ideal card 12gb vram gon na really rough soon enough
u definitely play high ultra sometimes even medium game demanding spiderman ac game u play get comfortably 60fps setting tweak atleast plan buy 2060 build new pc would recommend go recent one depending ur budget
high ultra unlikely like medium low
1080p good probably push 60fps ultra rt 1440p might need lower graphic handle 4k 2060 played 1080p upgrade 1440p get 3060 ti 4k monitor 4090 push 6090fps demanding game
context 2060 entry level card 3 generation ago already anemic ps5 generation console released really need temper expectation 2060 1080p 60fps type card likely need crank setting get decent framerate stable context rough gpu equivalent base ps5 amd 6700 using average timespy benchmark score get rough idea card compare nonraytraced game 6700 average score 10600 2060 average score 7400 mean base ps5 roughly 40 powerful 2060 game ps5 use listed medium option graphic setting compared pc setting mean cant enjoy game need adjust expectation capable hardware
maybe try get 2060 super extra vram yes 1080p lowmed setting even high somtimes youll good
still good using 1070
1060 6gb still good confirm definitely worth upgrading money though
thanks bro
ask youre planning upgrading
yes card listed 2x much close get 2060s 140 max used
got bro thanks
30 series 2025 bud
thanks bro ill checking th 30 series cuz 40 expensive
ask graphic push game high game title play
get job done game ive ever trouble poe2 endgame content unplayable
yeah thats good question im really sure def major upgrade tho bc want play 1440 max setting except rt max thinking 4070 ti super almost comedic upgrade id rather go big longevity go small useless 4 year game getting exponentially heavy hardware worth thinking may get 2060 45 year new aaa game come outwho know man like genuinely idk thats feel like gpu also trash fair
yep thats fair price vary lot region thats mentioned different thing country example nvidia always overpriced point 2060 similarly priced 6700xt
bad get job done depends exactly going
play fh5 ultramedium rt fh4 max 60fps time cpu bottleneck
make sense
think best 30 series 40 expensive
3090 would best priceperformance wise 3060ti 3070 3070 ti order 3070ti doe better base 4070 1440p gaming comparison personally recommend 4070ti price performance dont know 45 year good two year atleast u able play game best maybe also meet min req higher end aaa game may follow including gta6 ray tracing isnt big thing please look radeon card cheaper powerful check 40 series equivalent dont much knowledge exact comparison radeon nothing google search cant solve u
like one thats good next 4 5 year
im new pc gaming radeon card compatible intel intel core i7 12700
depends low standard
yes yes look bottleneck u finalize gpu see u might need upgrade cpu u prolly dont check
thanks bro
slightly slower nvme though samsung 870 evo performs close samsung pm991 think like 970 evo oem anyway big difference load time unless afford gen 5 high end gen 4 id go samsung 870 evo cause easy find im biased
5600 officially supported technically 6000 overclock basically cpu handle issue amd guarantee 5600
green oem stick obvious choice show beautiful chip dont matter cpu run whatever throw whatever sound better 6000mts c30 probably way go
look like solid budget build man nitpick id probably go bit credible ssd air cooler instead super cheap aio honestly nothing bad

mean extend budget little give less spend monitor im rebuilding whole setup also aio fan count
nah like said everything pretty solid air cooler get bit cheaper better quality cheap aio hence one crucial probably cheapest ssd credibility thats good good budget build around 1 intake ideal necessary deleted original fan comment one intake ideal actually would pull battery mount hot air 4 4 set good like said nitpick build solid
ssd brand matter long nvme2 like 1500 speed everyone get shit manufactured company basically gpu chip
yeah ill probably steal fan current pc need worry buying also good air cooler recommendation
thermalright phantom spirit 120 se
pc mum house cooling 5800x idle 50c 85c load still able keep 7600x
7500f see 64c full load peerless assassin 120 se previous version phantom spirit even better considering 7500f 7600 7600x cpu fine
right thank
standoff designed used air cooler pc shuts overheating
noted thank ill first admit im savvy stuff trying learn go would find cooler compatible standoff seem line fine thought purchased cooler said am4 compatible help appreciated
cooler compatible socket believe standoff problem creating much space cooler touch cpu use adjustable wrench unscrew cooler standoff remaining standoff mb cooler would compatible standoff one came
id probably take part lower spend extra real nice 1200w psu youre gon na want overhead dont see needing 96gb game yet workstation stuff sure could probably rock 64gb could also probably buy m2 less storage save way unsure atm im rocking 9800x3d im also aiming sweet 5090fe decided 64gb id also like say enjoy look aios could spring one instead weird air cooler usually recommend phantom spiritpeerless assassin air cooler job relatively cheap 14700k sure stand 9800
httpspcpartpickercomlistkdl8jn would probably go well known reviewed aio ram probably overkill doesnt really matter sat point price wise guess would run stability test make sure 6400mt work correctly gear1 ssd without heatsink would remove either motherboard ssd heatsink get one heatsink
would pick ddr56000 unless youre planning adjust setting manually
way need 96gb ram gaming already save 200 ram going 32gb 6000mhz cl30 best cpu
man went pc part picker clicked sort price high low threw top pick lol
need ssd without heatsink gon na take try ensure build stable insane horsepower dont high spec nothing thats 96 ram
would defeat highest spec purpose though
price big deal picking high end spec
need ssd without heatsink would get sdd without heatsink would use m2 heatsink thats motherboard
thats goal 128gb
youre trying get scammed yeah
well glad im actually making progress picking pc part making real good rig time thought would hopeless
possible many said never fill 4 ram slot
thing supposed insane high end spec dont think gon na cheap
im sure deep internet find 2x64 kit also possible use 4 slot usually dont use 4 slot overwhelm memory controller reduce performance goal highest spec
yeah high spec still maintaining stability hopefully find 64
game day becoming cpu intensive kind crazy massive jump change console generation allowed 3000 series amd cpu likely feeling pretty long tooth gaming point easiest way extend life system newer game swap cpu 5700x3d 3d cache great allowing higher smoother framerates game remember gpu side equation 6700xt slightly powerful base ps5
u reckon upgraded point like im getting around 150170 fps game like rainbow 6 siege
get much stronger gpu doubt ask reduce price 10 20 buck might price already fair 160 spend sure get used rx 6650 xt
thanks dont want spend really light 1080p gaming try another 10 discount
like 1080p upscaled

pc like leave 16h turn next day wont boot would work 17h yes would would probably work day long untill turned became cold start removing part 1 1 see one failed might something stupid like cmos battery start replace new one
well bit fiddling running perfect sure issue cmos feel like likely culprit ill probably start
rbuildapcforme
mate working keep saying must add attachment
there definitely something wrong pc cheap personally would try figure obligatory plugged monitor gpu motherboard right specifically i5 end building new pc would least try reusing definitely gpu probably psu case cooler stock one case fan find new pc isnt performing expected confident either psu gpu dying since component would reusing impact performance significantly
9800x3d current best gaming cpu 9950x3d also need productivity performance probably overkill occasional video editing though gpus youll probably looking 5080 want max budget 5090 would recommend making list ukpcpartpickercomhttpsukpcpartpickercom fit budget preference getting feedback go rbuildapcforme want full list made instead

hard give advice without knowing budget expected use general though assuming budget around 2600 id go back 32gb ram gskill 6000mhzcl30 need 64gb anyway invest better cpu like 7600x3d get one 7700x9600x9700x etc
httpsaupcpartpickercomlistfvp7v4httpsaupcpartpickercomlistfvp7v4 u get stock cooler cpu u really want market cooler least get dual tower cooler case u upgrade cpu future one u picked lame today 64gb waste gaming u said u play dc quick google search show minimum game 16gb recommended 32gb 99 game recommended 16gb rarely u see 32gb never saw game recommends 64gb cheaper mobo performance upgradability im fan non mesh case inferior airflow course u like one u picked stick 100w psu price tier personally would wait new nvidia gpus supposed available next month also im fan nvme review aint good dont see something close price region also would upgrade 2tb u region see crucial t500 teamgroup cardea a440 kingston kc3000 lexar nm790 think would go 1st 2nd one mentioned two considered equally good
plan playing dc mainly told 64gb ram highly recommended especially multiplayer would suggest differently
thank advice went 64gb ram suggested couple time id probably need dc think unnecessary really would like know problem waiting wont hard get im fine waiting little dont plan buying part right anyway eould 5070ti9070xt similar performance 4070ti super sorry thats silly question
main reason im getting pc play dc similar game suggested couple time 64gb ram suitable think unnecessary
build linked dont know anything im double triple checking help appreciated completely open people criticism advice cpu seems sore point people pointed cpu would suggest look pc something im fussed id rather work better thats mesh case
ram aswell something people suggested try go people sceptical continue looking save buck wont complain wont get something unnecessary
deleted
im familiar cant really suggest anything
went 64gb ram suggested couple time id probably need dc think unnecessary really would like know experience look really ram heavy quick search thats main game might worthwhile go 64gb problem waiting wont hard get im fine waiting little dont plan buying part right anyway eould 5070ti9070xt similar performance 4070ti super sorry thats silly question hard say availability stock itll probably better 5090 launch guess 5070ti 9070xt likely bit performance similar price point much thats really case confirmed independent review benchmark available
google dc yeah simulator game hog ram seems dc bad memory management though see several mention itll eat whatever ram saw someone mention using 90gb system seems 32gb still good enough particular game though see 64gb interesting case see mention use post still havent mentioned budget cant really say much else id still focus getting better cpu

thank ill keep build linked saved think ive convinced wait 5070ti instead getting 4070ti super would still compatible sorry thats silly question
worry got ta admit hard definitively recommend one cpu another since 7600non x pretty good performance cost confident youd happy said though x version slightly higher boost clock default give approx 57 higher performance average far tell x3d version even higher gaming x3d version excels single threaded gaming perform slightly worse typically multi threading sidenote typically x version cpu dont come cooler aware id recommend thermalright phantom spirit anyway id definitely look benchmark different cpu game play youtube great help decide apart depends much would willing put right youre thinking upgrading near ish future 7700x ive undervolted slightly performs 1020 better regular 7600 benchmark ive seen absolutely worth slightly higher cost
yeah compatible people may claim u better get mobo pcie gen5 yesterday proven 5090 gen4 v gen5 like 12 fps max absolutely nothing httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvl1npffrtzlot592shttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvl1npffrtzlot592s
ill remember someone try tell youve awesome man thank much
np also monitor u game maybe get 64gb ram really wan na couple week u blame 64gb xd u really need 64gb get httpsaupcpartpickercomproductl3cgxlcorsairvengeance48gb2x24gbddr56000cl30memorycmk48gx5m2b6000z30httpsaupcpartpickercomproductl3cgxlcorsairvengeance48gb2x24gbddr56000cl30memorycmk48gx5m2b6000z30 research much u need maybe ask game subreddit u need new budget monitor would get region httpsaupcpartpickercomproductmgwj7pasusrogstrixxg27acs2702560x1440180hzmonitorxg27acshttpsaupcpartpickercomproductmgwj7pasusrogstrixxg27acs2702560x1440180hzmonitorxg27acs
already monitor given unsure exact model asus run 1440p 144hz yeah research everything week atleast buying anything definately ask around ram
would wait especially everything happens life right amd nvidia going release new line better still upgrade gpu couple month therefore wait imo
youre eu would worry u tariff id go 7800 xt ray tracing isnt issue also always underclockundervolt card use less power performance impact
girlfriend expecting job security stable time dont upgrade period wont time play game anyway
thank yeah could im nervous everything going posibility able upgrade foreseable future ill try wait thanks
make sense ive heard undervolting must
nah much time gaming son born finished dark soul trilogy multiple time fallout 4 mostly home paternal leave take care wife son thing newborn dont really need much mostly sleep eat first month mostly go grocery make dinner cleanup change diaper change clothes thats baby start actually something yeah thats different thing
appreciate concern 1660 almost dead work pc im gon na need buy one anyway thats im undecided everything going nvidia new card coming tariff u possibly also affecting european market idk wanted help guidance opinion upgrading option
yeah thats fully understandable gaming probably one hobby important get sometimes away everything cool pressure always 500700 bank might help 1660 still viable option fullhd
actually need gpu work also use cpu onboard graphic

cant speak exact part since dont know whats available here thought good mobo pick dont see problem assume ram 2x16gb mean could upgrade 64gb future another set matching stick needed didnt say speed ram ddr5 go 9600mts incredibly expensive comparatively little performance increase get 7800 7200 way less cpu cooler 9800x3d powerful chip need either nice dual stack dual fan air cooler least 240mm watercooler
thanks man also yes ram 2x16
personal preference big
99 time purely aesthetic liquid cooler expensive introduce point failure rarely actually quieter air cooler good air cooler beat match best water cooler 12 price less kind like rgb get think look cool doesnt actually much impact performance
nope cpu need liquid cooler cooled chunky single tower dual tower anything 200 msrp get 20 single tower cooler heat output unless buying high end cpu want look waste money could put somewhere else
cooling aesthetic
well depends necessity vert mounted gpu room air cooler term cooling performance honestly probably better air cooler many case high end big aios really worth hottest cpu yesh space constraint issue aio solve
top line air cooler run 6075 give take aios asthetic anything tbh
depends want prioritise overclocking gaming performance still 1080ti new pc mandatory new graphic card
mean honestly depends processor youre getting wouldnt get air cooler cool 14900k

say unless strong enough cpu handle stronger gpu changing motherboard essentially building new pc might well especially still using ddr4

youre mainly gaming want stick budget grab ryzen 5 5600x put money better gpu swing ryzen 7 5700x3d without really cutting back gpu itll give setup thats futureproof flexible
am5 platform ryzen 5 7600 7600x even 7500f thank later
gpu im thinking putting rx 6750xt also want cpu bit balanced gpu thats im hard time choosing ryzen 5 5600x also like 140 euro cheaper
looked really like suggestion forgot clarify im looking building am4 system
x3d chip result higher 1 low fps give way smoother experience go 5700x3d mean dont cut back component play lot competitive shooter
going ryzen 5 5600x let spend gpu usually boost gaming performance smart move want best bang buck especially gaming main goal hand need pc stuff us core thread like video editing streaming stretch budget bit without skimping gpu ryzen 7 5700x3d might good option pure gaming performance ryzen 5 5600x rx 6750 xt fine
dead platform without possibility upgrade new cpu anymore back 2018 bought am4 board ddr4 ram ryzen 2600 cpu made sense buy 5700x3d already everything else building new system scratch make sense buy old platform am5 ddr5 logic suggestion
thanks suggestion im thinking spending less gpu
well ill mostly use gaming bit programming ig anything fine think
yeah youre right bit skeptical going am5 heard part expensive already tight budget honesty saw say looked decided go am5 since build came almost performance money yes im thinking getting ryzen 5 7500f suggested along rx 6750xt msi pro b650s wifi motherboard quiet pure power 750w kingston technology fury 16gb 5600 speed think
gaming bit programming ryzen 5 5600x solid pick performs well game handle regular programming task ease choosing cpu youll extra cash spend better gpu part really boost gaming experience pairing rx 6750 xt ryzen 5 5600x give fantastic gaming setup cpu handle programming fine combo great fit need without breaking bank
well yes am4 announced 2016 today 2025 enough said good build starter great potential future improvement cant go wrong sure
see thanks help appreciate
yes one best value cpu gpu depending pricing would consider option
definitely overkill 4080s certain game enable dlss get 100fps 1440p
httpspcpartpickercomlistfzyvb2 would get cpu aliexpresshttpswwwaliexpressusitem3256805676873344htmlspma2g0oproductlistmain55800yrruyrruilalgopvid290bbab8251a4515b1ecb7360958d1bfalgoexpid290bbab8251a4515b1ecb7360958d1bf2pdpextf7b22order223a222201222c22eval223a221227dpdpnpi440dis21usd212983521146672121212983521146672140211b430817381378430371146e4f09211200004345030586221sea21us21021abxcurpageloguidwohkloopqe6cutparamurlscene3asearch7cqueryfrom3a build like full white build less
performance increase huge yes probably older gamesi mean youll get fps sure
lol yeah im considering maybe 7800x3d 4070ti instead dont play anything crazy concerned longevity
dont difference 2 10 max get 7800x3d cheaper go
get 7800x3d 100 cheaper worth still pair 4080 super
yes whats rest build btw want proper review
httpspcpartpickercomlistfn3l4p mind micro center bundle price motherboard processor accurate also ram changeable cl 30 due bundle incompatibility
okay look good either 9800 7800 work good im fan aios thats personal preference
ive gone back forth aio obviously corsair refuse use 19 different apps control rgb save money considered 240ml fan variant however worried wont cool cpu well enough especially 9800x3d suggestion welcomed
oh got rid every rgb software good feeling ngl ye fact aios require extra sw irritates cool enough hot cpu id still go noctua nhd15 quiet dark rock 4 currently use
might honestly switch 240mm aio since cheaper wouldnt make cooling difference especially good airflow case
1 work much spend 2 work gpus price range 3 look review gpus hit fps want 4 buy gpu
dont need 5000 series play valorant highest setting 2080 super run game max graphic
built b850 steel legend 9800x3d seems great far also bought newegg great customer experience despite living way hawaii honored holiday extended return period x870 sl bought able get b850 instead dont need usb4 would rather additional m2 slot b850 suspect improvement b650 time tell front
install ram problem building 9600xbased system less upgrade problem getting gigabyte b650 mobo booting got light indicating dram error turn 2 stick ram install 2nd 4th slot outward cpu 1st 3rd vast majority board ive worked since ddr1 first came applies board well according manual doesnt help minimum viable configuration cpu installed 1 stick ram dimma2 monitor hooked onboard gpu add part one one cant boot anymore minimum config doesnt work attempt restoreupdate bios flashback feature howto described manual herehttpswwwasuscomsupportfaq1038568 addition board fan control bug fixed v3067 bios case update version performance improvement well way neither store actually way know bios installed unless board booted first updating bios reason still viable board run 9000 installed bios new enough doesnt mean board updated store
update bios
fan rgb light working turn check cable reinstall ram check whether psu working httpshelpcorsaircomhcenusarticles360025085372psuhowtotestapsupowersupplyunit psu fine part working dismantle computer install used use add new part one one eg bought new gpu remove old one install new gpu working mean part problem contact customer service fan psu working 1 turn monitor check cable socket 2 make sure plug video cable gpu instead motherboard 3 cable interface broken try another cable plug another interface 4 pc working contact customer service repairing gpu feel free ask anything
alredy updated support 9000 series
thanks answer helpful front fan working properly one working aio fan pump seem working properly test psu see problem 1 monitor message appears screen showing signal 2 monitor connected gpu 3 try another cable update
cpu gon na bottleneck new graphic card sure mean 500700 budget cpumotherboard also saying youre gon na keep i78700k 500700 upgrade cpumobo switch ddr5 ram opinion motherboard isnt gon na change much need get something compatible whatever cpu decide go get correct ram mobo ddr4ddr5 may able reuse old case depending used mine 11 year finally upgraded lol bought new fan cpu cooler psu dont skimp get least 750w 850w good future proofing future upgrade
ya know else massive
say didnt know worth upgrading i7 planned keeping fine gon na bottle neck yeah ill def upgrade recommendation ram pcpartpicker ddr5 wasnt showing turn due i7 selected lmao yeah ill probably go ddr5 new cpu motherboard yeah ill probably look see exactly need decide everything else get one bit harder recommend relies everything else actually got brand new case dad best friend birthday really birthday present talking upgrading 50 series come build pc fun gave new case late birthday present lot garage work perfectly since ive also like 1112years lol psu yeah thats aiming current 650 gon na upgrade nice margin 1000w picked first iteration building pc seems bit excessive im probably gon na go lower 100w
mom
e5 2680 v4 solid choice ram buy 4x16gb 2400 rdimm memory ecc overkill youd like sell 3 stick way take advantage quad channel rtx 2080 good little get 3060 ti 3070 would better choice gaming wiselets say need work low cpu frequency gaming though bad photoshopvideo editing ca think quite good im sure though since dont shouldnt big bottleneck anyway
experienced faster boot time 9950x non3d v 7950x3d confirm using setting 9th gen boot faster
7800x3d issue updated bios booting window used take 50 average 56s
kept old mainboard ram right kept setting upgraded cpu
mainboard using know asrock mcr pd enabled default b650 board certain bios version could reason people would fast boot time different manufacturer manufacturer
direct cpu swap twice confirm exact config
fresh system driver armouryexperienceadrenalin needed optional install like
ive read hardware wont detected without armoury crate kinda install thread ive read say suffer bad experience since installed
hardware wont detected without driver armoury download install driver
go 7700x bump gpu 7900xtx 1440p non issue even 7900xt able run anything 1440p
7700x 7900xt would fine know everyone recommends 7800x3d everything read basically invest extra 7800x3d good feel like except future proofing worth 1440p budget matter
really compare two 7800x3d much better look value per dollar youd getting value spending 200 better gpu
return psu get new one
elaborate little noob like one older part previous build cant return normal power supply suddenly start overheating year zero issue even 50 max wattage load
normal fan bearing broken get cooled
part fail time psu could take rest part go badly replace nothing fix
great point thank straight answer im thinking thing least 7 year old im going order new one play game meantime lol
good call
id say yes ddr4 system dead platform wont get new cpu amd committed support am5 platform least 2027
totally worth considering ddr5 day
afford dont dont youd avoid next gen version
ddr5 way
absolutely worth last longer hold value resale performs bit better good upgrade path get 300 dollar bundle ryzen 7600 motherboard 16gb ram kit microcenter get started live near one
dont build am4 system scratch thatd dumb eol
ddr5 way go youre building new rig extra 200 buck
ddr5 ddr4 old system new platform especially amd supporting ddr5 much cheaper nowadays compared 3 year ago definetly worth
yes long long doesnt cripple budget forcing get much weaker gpu example beside initial performance advantage 7600 v 5600 am5 mean much faster cpu upgrade needed future 9800x3d gaming possibly even faster one next gen cpu launched am5 well
access aliexpress could get 7400f 125 get b650mhm2 100 silicon power ddr5 6000 cl30 32gb 80 isnt much am4 would cost new
others would say id personally say get top spec 4 itll cheaper better midspec 5 everyone say bla bla dead gen 6 like 20278 play normal game 100 fps 1440p top gen 4 need last 2 year absolutely everyone say oh well cant upgrade wont need 5 boy wont able upgrade 2 year marketing advice lot get stuck wanting wasting money amount time iv upgraded part spent like 400 new part barely better context bought second rig ddr4 build uk 600 including peripheral 5700x3d 6700xt lot spending 3000 play 4k vr wont basically make top spec 4 maybe used part approved dealer 2027 go 6
ill second
current spec
honestly minecraft demanding hardware computer run smoothly dont need buy anything new need clean case cpu fun system optimization like closing automatic start process kill malwarevirus
try driver setting dont know name program amd nvidia nvidia control pannel see optimize minecraft lag system optimized least thats ive heard
powercolor 6650xt 5600x 16gb 3600mhz ddr4 ram
upgrade gpu r5 5600x still strong cpu
ive thinking upgrading 3080 anything better consider
technically minimum psu requirement 650 watt model
nvidia recommends least 650w long psu isnt poo tier fine
rtx 4070s draw 225w going fine
im sure top head u think corsair rm650
fine
less
oh sorry 200 less 4070 super
laptop 260hz monitor 260hz
hdmi 21 converter wouldnt change anything would still bottlenecked hdmi cable
first reset cmos see boot original cpu ram gpu get running update bios
whats best way took cmos battery replaced
check mobo manual jumper location need bridge
sata ssds directly replace hard drive use exact interface faster nvme ssds require motherboard support pc built last 56 year support
yes ssds faster less moving part noving part buy sata ssd replace hdd faster anyway read m2 able use mobo
ive learnt nvme ssds knew needed support wondering one thank find motherboard support slot
thank
know motherboard cpu
sorry late check tomorrow
would install latest chipset driver socket using ssd brand sound like something preventing properly working component would involved cpu thats said install latest chipset driver socket also might well install latest bios havent already
never experienced issue like said usually ssd vendor usb bootable utility apps maybe try see start seeing issue utility reading post made feel saga wishing successful troubleshooting would hate troubleshoot nvmem2 slot mobo one otherwise youre left sata ssds better hdds man welcome early 2010s might able find cheap identical replacement mobo ebay
mind numbing difficulty narrowing bsod issue 18 month period replaced ram cpu ssd constantly reloading window thinking something corrupt used without graphic card nothing fixed psu supplied cable marginally short reach motherboard purchased small extender cable 150mm long turn connector used cable making poor connection motherboard due poor quality pin construciton whenever heavy current load drawn power would flip cause bsod end constructed new power cable attach psu motherboard run perfect since
random hardware error reported various error motherboard keep setting regardless motherboard firmwarechipset firmwaremotherboard battery youve swapped attachable hardware confirmed error remain could take poke probably causing issue maybe summary well hint either mobo cpu cheapest testsolution new motherboard expensive solution error persist new cpu youre replacing motherboard inspect cpu socket bent burnt touching pin edit long shot defective underspecced power supply barely touching required power delivery youll get real wonky stuff time there small peak drain whatever reason edit2 make sure motherboard power connection attached dual 12v connect 2
similar system prime x370 pro ryzen 5950x rtx 3060 ti 32 gb ddr4 3600 c18 ram cant say ive issue bios reset usually mean failed boot possibly due failing memory training mean bios setting stable specific bios setting ive tweaked improve performance stability procodt 40 ohm cmd2t 1t maximum performance also try force 2t improve stability gear mode disabled try enabled improve stability power enabled disabled setting important without setting system would randomly crash 0very low cpu usage everything precision boost overdrive set auto equal pbo pbo board cause cpu run hot draw lot power performance gain default cpu limit fine unless want get overclockingundervolting
bios latest chipset driver updated yet recieved frequent whea bsod ssd brand old one silicon power new one kioxia friend adata
seems like worse fate come pc error space last 15 year still error never fail surprise sure try searching bootable utility app like im left many option ive already spent money new ssd doesnt work upcoming week im afraid ill shelling new mobo thinking msi b550 line b550 provdh wifi tomshardware rated good 5050 mixed review reddit
suspected might power supply thus occt custom stress test included cpu gpu ram test good amount time yet bsod friend ssd ssd bsods frequent sometimes streaming video even time nothing running hdd ofcourse ssd pulled past couple week zero issue watched movie downloaded stuff meeting zero bsod yesterday soon popped new ssd started different bsod error
yep either mobo cpu really dont feel cpu since ive done occt test full load everything fine new 5900x hardly year guess go warranty motherboard thinking going b450 since dont overclock something offer 2 m2 slot good enough vrm heatsink might run pbo thats im planning give ssd friend test system full occt today hdd attached last occt test friend ssd
super odd believe could slot since friend drive work perfectly fine try wiping clean install window using pc put see work motherboard doesnt idk go
could give good visual inspection maybe something lose touching thats visible rma
installed window new ssd attaching work pc test get home
dont buy 2 stick force ram run much slower speed buy whatever 2x kit ddr56000 cl30 ram like
c30 cl30 thing since 30 timing
im sure c30 refers exactly cl stand ca channel address strobe latency probably thing
chipset connects lot device share link back cpu cause slowdown ssd probably noticeable everyday use choice go one connects directly cpu
bit faster unless youre running database likely unnoticeable httpshothardwarecomnewsnvmessdcpuvschipsettesting
alternative option handle nvme device mobo
1 cpu m2 less hop cpu chipset m2 less hop fatser 2 cpu chipset typically 4x 8x link three 4x mvme drive sending data cpu example bottlenecked cpu chipset link thus nvme must slow non issue normal usage
well chipset connection cpu also x4 saturate m2 connection youd also saturating chipset connection result could cause connection issue chipsetconnected device usb network bluetooth etc however thats theory whether also able saturate practice depends drive use common run issue youve got 10gbe networking motherboard thats common added latency send data chipset instead direct connection cpu theory im sure whether youd notice practice
thanks
ah found doesnt warranty buy tray version still wondering think
old 3600 tray version worked completely fine never issue would go least tray cpu still warranty however cpu usually last longest component likely wont need warranty anyway
tray sold system builder warranty supposed provided system builder amd tray come said batch plastic tray get cooler box paper work kind cheaper oem system builder get volume pricing reputable site buyer protection get chance could used worst problematic cpu smaller builder trying get rid
picked one central 2 week ago running like dream ive gotten tray past issue whatsoever
shouldnt case tray option many sort thing parallel import saving bulk shipping box take space plastic tray thus allowing buy unit max shipping container space
warranty thats kinda
suck doesnt warranty 100 validchecked locally purchased tray cpu past always warranty difference come plastic protection cover box since provide oem certified tray bulk instead individually packed
mean come without paper box packaging
tray mean box stripped oem prebuilt something 5700x3d tray buy arrived plastic tray bottom clearly broken arrangement many tray cpu secured via single standard rubber band wrapped 2 time rolled bobble wrap sealed tape unimpressive packaging imagine work fine especially considering cpu pin perfect
seems store dependent tray cpu standard 3y warranty physical online store eeu country
friend built pc tray version 7700x save like 150200 using tray version cpu usually one leasterrorprone component system freak accident still happen case probably get seller warranty worse basically bet win save money cpu lose need spend money buy cpu say quite safe bet especially buy cpu motherboard seller help install cpu first motherboard make safer shipping
think warranty important unless price difference big give
doesnt warranty illegal
""
ended buying came 400 shipping stuff emailing store actually 3 year warranty im happy purchase cant wait get
thats mean mean literally ship tray meant used system builder manufacturer may warranty theyre taken prebuilts anything theyve never installed theyve never used dont retail packaging generally dont warranty warranty end user would supplied system builder intel amd honestly installed correctly ocd properly cooled properly functioning motherboard youd unlikely ever need use warranty thing fail processor one least likely
got 5700x3d tray cpu upgrade 3600 packaging pretty much described working great issue
box cpu 2 year tray 3 year got tray ryzen 7 7700 210
yep although bought couldnt find info ended buying anyway emailed 3 year warranty pretty happy purchase think
issue tray never know used people buy tray test good overclock return doesnt well
would explain brokenoff tray looking like broken set cpu tray kind like exactly like one gn use hold unused cpu storage
good deal 7700 comically overlooked price
feel like anything isint x3d currently overlooked matter price
bingo
would probably psu 850w one want stick corsair preferably rmx model 7800x3d likely overpriced 9800x3d isnt much would get instead could likely save money ssd make work look good otherwise
agree commenter 850w good idea peace mind reason chance power spike starving gpu power im glad see favorite bangforbuck ram kit list teamgroup tcreate expert kit hard beat 8590 plus like way look clean unobtrusive would also recommend trying get 9800x3d stock supposed improve soon use app site like hotstock alert stock got one newegg back november
anything bulldoze current cpu ryzen 7500f cheap serve well doubt spending 3 4x money maybe 30 performance make sense better upgrade sooner sell setup top range gpu low re setting
think 50 price difference worth newer zen5 architecture 7800x3d upgrading 78 year build part purchased except gpu aiming 5080 thursday release here link pcpart build 4k gaming aiming last many year also casual httpscapcpartpickercomlistbldl4p
7800x3d still second fastest gaming cpu market pair b650 motherboard 2x16 gb ddr56000 cl30 ram killer gaming pc
problem australia like 120 usd difference 2 lol
current price worth cost like 3x 7500fm faster price difference better save money upgrade sooner
look used market 850 get am5 platform mean got future upgrade
5700x3d usually way cheaper get aliexpress 150
honestly going 5800x3d route year wont hurt go am5
able get 5800x3d wouldnt bothered getting 9800x3d 3dvcache make cpu relevant long time
would get 5700x3d
setup 5600x 3080 thinking 3080 tad weak 1440p gaming without lot compromise boy wrong made jump 9800x3d regret 3080 running like new gpu get plus around 2030 fps heavier title suddelny max fps older competetive game like league legend heavy fps spike around 150 way 40 everything feel stable smooth good eversince upgraded granted dont know 5800x3d wouldnt big jump dont regret playing game feel lot better system general smooth fuck
5800x3d produced overpriced upgrade cpu maybe 5700x3d best value upgrading everything dictated gpu decide best value cpu keep resolution game better gpu first good cpu 5700x3d mostly enough save good upgrade
5800x3d pretty much bought get 5700x3d instead 9800x3d obviously much better either upgrading am5 isnt worth youre willing spend money check benchmark marvel rival 5700x3d 3080 4070 combo
nah get 5700x3d really close 5800x3d fraction price
honestly play 1440p 4k get used 5800x3d new 5700x3d cost 150200 buck depending get perform close instead playing stock roulette spending 1k marginal gain
9800x3d 4090 partner 5700x3d 3080 since say youll using marvel rival give number get around 200300fps marvel rival 1440p dlss35 performance 9800x3d get around 150200fps 1080p dlss35 balanced 5700x3d edit use everything low except texture model detail use ultra us high doesnt really affect fps depends vram
3080 5800x3d enough upgrade something like 5080 would wanting something like 7800x3d 5800x3d par 7600x lot game put perspective much faster am5 chip
maybe want future proof investment especially upgrading old hardware one 5800 doesnt support ddr5 pcie 50 depends use case would think demand hardware performance keep growing need ddr5 point
would upgrade gpu anything right 5900x along rtx 3080 upgrade gpu 5080 hold year full rebuild replacing cpu hopefully am6 released
increase 5700x3d5800x3d 7800x3d9800x3d much said get 5700x3d 200 would dont think jump performance would worth account need new mobo ram
5x00x3d going plenty cpu setup make sense paired 3080 cpu well balanced powerful gpus lot case said test make sure gpu bottleneck isnt horribly optimised ue5 game whats fps 1080p minimum setting think ive seen 5600x run high refresh afaik game hammer gpu high setting think might ray tracing think game us nanite lumen try dropping setting see actually gpu holding thing back online game competitive setting way go anyway
someone 4090 9800x3d alot cpu considering ur using 3080 upgraded 5800x3d ur going rock 3080 1440p id go 5800x3d cheaper amazing perf dollar upgraded legit use computer 8 hour day day 4090 240hz 1440p monitor made sense gg wallet tho
id keep 5600x tbh good couple year especially 1440p 4k
oversimplify incoming hopefully get basic idea across reason difference two cpu would significant higherend gpus lower resolution essentially given game cpu maximum framerate varies based whats happening game part element depend cpu arent easy scale gpudependent stuff whereas gpu much tweakable higher resolution higher texture postprocessing effect etc long gpus max output setting resolution use lower 5800x3d manage wont see much difference faster cpu say game 5800x3d manage 90fps 9800x3d 130 3080 80 5080 120 totally made number based real performance 5800x3d 3080 together get 80fps upgrading 9800x3d wouldnt much 5080 would get 90fps 5800x3d able full 120 9800x3d similarly game 3080 might able manage say 110fps lowered resolution case youd also see difference two cpu make sense
maybe 10 performance difference game 5800x3d v 9800x3d significantly less investment since would gut system replace mobo ram cpu playing 1440p even less likely notice difference max am4 board consider platform change year
play favorite game see whether cpu gpu max usage cpu need upgrade
cpu heavy game 9800x3d 40 faster 5800x3d based personal testing experience game matter arent dependant heavy cpu usage 5700x3d likely fine come play itd nice site benchmarked 5700x3d v 7800x3d v 9800x3d havent seen one 3
went 5800x3d 4070ti road never looked back ill stay setup till am6 come matter throw pc itll run anything smoothly 1440p suggest go 5800x3d skip am5 tbh am5 isnt really worth
reason extra super duper high refresh rate monitor 500hz want use
5600x bad day
yes upgrade performance upgrade nut least 30 uplift much worth upgrade
sorry similar question since everyone thought asking worth upgrading ryzen 7 7700x ryzen 7 9800x3d knowledge
5800x3d evga 3080 12gb also play marvel rival 1440p able get 150200 fps tinkering setting dont even like ultra setting much since confusing hell even happening 3 player use ult time lowered setting definitely better opinion plan skip am5 altogether maybe start am6 come around 5700x3d fine slower around 35 compared 5800x3d
5800x3d want 9800x3d
value main concern would upgrade anything setup next gen ie ryzen 10800x3d rtx 6080
similar past 5800x 5800x3d 9800x3d there obvious noticeable increase jump depend type application run run cpu heavy simulation type game often ask app requires run
doom requires 8 core cpu minimum graphic 5000 series may conservative
didnt x3d model recently upgraded 5950x 9800x3d rust game bumped 80120 fps around 160220 fps 1440p 4080 super worth
upgraded cpu 5900x 9800x3d also upgraded ram mobo plan upgrading gpu 3080 50805090 depending price upgrade ive done far im seeing 50 frame
went 5800x3d 9800x3d week ago feel major improvement game play right ive really tested tarkov bought poe2 high fps isnt much higher maybe 30 1 low feel best dont get stuttering anymore either game well worth money also paired evga 3080 honestly upgrade im second guessing need upgrade video card lol
see noticeable improvement game massive frame drop like marvel rival stalker 2 upgraded 9800x3d week ago frame drop tiny bit dr strange open portal im also finally able run rimworld kenshi without performance hit lag spike game 200 mod installed youll generally see large gain simulation strategy game everything cpu bound much framerate overall performance turn timer vast reduction frame drop stuttering
several point note 5800x 3d longer produced less qc make 5700x 3d zen 3 x 3d chip slower 12th gen modern ddr5 6400 mhz modern title due memory bandwidth ddr5 offer advantage thing play solely esportolder game zen 4 3d zen 5 3d got faster core ddr5 make far faster even beating 14th gen fast 5600x see much reason upgrade fps bump today game moment cpu extremely problematic 5700x 3d help much usually cache bottleneck game pushing much harder cpu
5800x3d 3080ti im planning go am5 anytime soon year ill upgrade gpu something like 6080
check benchmark game wan na play decide performance gain worth price
went 5600x 5800x3d tell newer game make difference world game like star citizen remnant 2 dying light 2 others saw around 20fps jump 2k remnant 2 nerud level went 25fps slideshow without fsr 35fps fsr 55fps native resolution going x3d part star citizen city orison went 30fps 50fps back 317318 patch game mentioned least saw smoother consistent fps number reduction stuttering let know get performance 5700x3d well many game listed tested initially older bios version supported x3d kept 34ghz max updated bios later version allowed boosting saw improvement 5fps game
5700x3d like 200 microcenter
talk spec day resolution upgrade path end day answer depends gpus tend important thing game performance day cpu holding back cpu starting give problem itll usually present really bad 1 low freeze hang ups depending game might see almost performance increase upgrading cpu game might benefit greatly really hard say without example think cpu starting show age going like 9800x3d would better upgrade youre worried running cyberpunk ultra setting higher framerate 5060 frame maybe flipping rt perhaps consider 5080 going 5700x3d think little juice cpu would help anyways dunno probably wouldnt miniscule upgrade cpu itll little boost youll probably underwhelmed maybe look trying overclocking
get am5 4 year install 11800x3d
get 9700x
5600 5700x3d 7600x3d 9800x3d yes point something asap youre u market shift new paradigm change view availability youre ocer constant gamer like friend gave old 3800x he extremely happy still dont need latest greatest need 26 year answer yes upgrade 7600x3d 7800x3d cheap avail get 9800x3d 5700x3d enough many game
yes really good jump 575800x3d series gpu would bottleneck allow get next gpu upgrade however plan skipping nvidia 5000 series better waiting amd 11800x3d since 9800x3d even bottle neck nvidia 5090
went am5 wanted ability upgrade road already am4 probably would gone 5700 5800 x3d variant get job done well
9800x3d way way way faster 5800x3d 5700x3d simply slotting 5700x3d existing machine way less change likely way cheaper good least couple year
didnt already 5800x3d id get 5700x3d pair 7800xt gpu motherboard 2017 lol honestly dont think im going upgrade year game like play run great 3440x1440
upgraded 98x3d 58x3d crazy performance gain cs2
probably worth
playing game rtx 4090 1080p1440p probably way youll see difference
cool dont know aliexpress delivers region never used ill check edit get 5700x3d 200 assuming seller legit lol
could find one reliable seller price id order lot closer 200 though seen lately
would make sense go 5800x 5700x3d would silly
really wish saw week ago ordered 5700x3d amazon third party seller paid 250 plus tax third party seller still hasnt shipped made order thursday cancel order amazon putting release ticket least show seller shipped damn cpu kicker also bought 4070 arrived amazing upgrade old 5700xt cpu gpu cpu cooler new na 10tb drive reloaded amazon gift balance full cost purchase cancel order third party seller need ship cpu balance would go back gift card balance need get refunded back debit card used purchase tldr dont like research site 5700x3d
ive looked oni ali 300
didnt find lower 195 one went 5700x 110
also get like 7500f though price even 7500f par 5700x3d new platform massive upgrade already ahead cpu people pc right great 144fps budget
yeah am4 op want am5
probably skip am5 go am6 5800x3d beast still
actually neither 5800x3dnor 5700x3d available anywhere region im naive ig think 5700x3d available 200
yes thats great upgrade especially upgrade gpu later
looking upgrade 5700x rx 6800 xt gaming 4k seeing upgrading would give fps boost doesnt seem worth yes playing lower resolution get lot fps console peasant deep like playing tv wrong one thinking eventually getting 5700x3d need skipping am5 entirely
upgraded 9800x3d 5600x 3080 10gb one thing noticed much stable system setting compared set 5600x many problem trying run ram expo set pbo probably 6 month longer bios mature enough asus x570 tuf gaming pro wifi motherboard running gigabyte x870e aorus master basically zero issue getting running except build error allowing boot set expo pbo ran stress test got number looked acceptable calling day
would 5700x3d able keep 5080
well make sense since 1080p cpu heavy 1440p obviously 4090 carry u big time
yes thats exactly im thinking time im sure much cpu actually hold back gpu maybe 5700x3d really enough even 5080 fututr gen gpus know
kinda yes alright day wouldnt buy since old soon outdated
depends youre playing resolution framerates youre targeting
worth weird word never worth wan na spend unesscary like 12 perfomance go ahead
depends game setting game play resolution etc upgraded 7800x3d 9800x3d got like 50 fps path exile 2 meanwhile game like helldivers 2 ive noticed zero difference
129 tax find deal
gpu
used computer hardware global 5700x3d aliexpress came little unmarked brown box issue cpu comet store also frequently mentioned user little search user recommendation
microcenter stock 212 pick stateside sure still sure anyone aliexpress sell profit around price fyi
upgraded 5600 5700x3d 3090 became bottleneck 1440p 9800x3d without upgrading gpu would waste money
ordered one 160 coupon get week next latest understand correctly sell oem one without cooler get bulk thats cheaper
get newopen box ebay well grabbed one 297 cad plus shipping
bought mine day ago spain seller leon laptop store already courier warehouse paid like 150 wont get taxed ship another eu country
depends 9800x3d roughly twice fast game
find reputable seller 200 let know price jumped way last month
5700x less 5600x comparable 5700x3d though
keep looking go sale every day got 140 week ago
7500f requires another 300 mobo ram good move want future upgrade am5 bad move want skip am5 together
never said want am5 asking stay am4 go am5
yeah im boat 5800x3d finger crossed getting 5080 hoping hold skip am5
got 5800x3d launch havent wanted upgrade im rocking high end superbly binned ram raid 0 multiple samsung 990s x16 slot m2 add card came godlike play fallout 4 witcher 3 get chance evga 3080ti cpu come nowhere close bottlenecked hit cyberpunk great wish steam return within 24h havent opened since felt 0 pressure upgrade work great 1440p ultrawide am6 probably switch dont really want get new gear zen6
am6 still way though amd confirmed zen 6 still am5 thats slated late 2026 early 2027 release am6 whatever socket use next still another two full year possibly personally id use chance go am5 two three year long time come computer motherboards andor ddr4 going get difficult annoying source time period anything need replacing upgrading
beast noticed much slack compared 9800x3d well even 4k dropping huge fps crowded area easily play 360fps 9800x3d whereas 5800x3d struggled 200240s
plan
5800x3d 4090 great 4090 never bottlenecked playing 4k 144hz capped 144 120 fps cant actually tell difference look like 5080 slightly 4090 term performance good fit need get 9800x3d unless want push extremely high fps smaller resolution
amd discontinued october price going ever since 5800x3d almost impossible get normal price month
yeah guess 4k still stability smoothness factor much fps gain
yes 4080 super 5700x3d problem keeping 5080 less 10 faster
100
depends re 1440p might bottleneck 210 game doesnt utilise 3d vcache well really something worry
upgraded 5700x3d saving 5080 hope push am4 system till am6 point im hoping hopscotch full build minus gpu reuse current gpu upgrade gpus purely due cost thing day
personally im concerned much performance security older cpu carry nasty vulnerability cant addressed without major performance impact im sure new cpu share problem unlikely something glaring zenbleed one
latest aaa game 1440 p 240hrz dont hit lol anything 90 fine im running 3070 fine might upgrade
got thanks info tried searching online couldnt find proper comparison
deal
68xt
thats interesting found user httpswwwaliexpresscomstore2665152spma2g0ndetail100001315c335885tk5l62pagepathindexhtm
always risk pay importcosts check package
amazon order also came box like reached support said give said get amd due shortage idea true kept cpu work fine sharing since sound like experience different retailer
theyre reselling chinesemarket cpu could afford cut price understanding amd ever check serial number rma probably deny warranty
im still seeing 5700x3ds local microcenter 220usd someone rbuildapcsales said still go sale 170usd
im currently running 9800x3d 2070 definitely noticeable performance increase i5 9600k maybe 10 framerate boost also 10c cooler due temp within case dont worry 2070 built system last week im waiting 9070xt
huh im running 5600x 3090 right tempting especially game like anno 1800 civ 7
idk think upgrading step bad idea always bottleneck upgrading whole system always pain as way expensive upgrade creates notable performance uplift afford go
im considering move even though im 3060ti admittedly probably bottleneck im guessing might give little boost 200 buck cant say new powerful gpu im wondering lower max clock speed 5700x3d problem game
5700x3d doesnt come cooler anyways real difference
store order
please update receive looking seemed bit sketchy
want stay locked am4 alternative considering also going 9800x3d frankly common sense least get door am5 upgrade 11000 series ryzen cpu year know seeing am5 jo near finished even 5700x3d starting struggle modern game better option upgrade instead spending close 200 buck side grade rather upgrade plus could literally sell current stuff fund am5 entry point would serve significantly better long run also like 200 buck motherboard ram 300
b650 tomahawk wifi 180 120 r5 7500f ae 115 corsair vengeance 64 gb ddr5 600 cl30 400 am5 build perform 5700x3d 200 allow upgrade couple year am6 thing
whats gpu
ddr4 going get difficult annoying source time period anything need replacing upgrading bought 4 stick nzxt 3800cl14 running 3800 cl13 one died hit transistor fell hoping dont need extra one one dy itll one
think people aokay 200240 fps lol
game
curiosity graphic card thinking upgrading
yeah theyre asking 9800x3d even 7800x3d would improvement 5700x3d 4080 super would run lot thing much faster cpu upgrade might perceptably problem keeping youre probably leaving fair bit performance table 10
5090
sorry kind hijacking looking pc bottleneck site said 1080p 5700x3d slow even 4070 super site reliable
found secondhand 4090 asus tuf 1500 around expect 5080 end live worth pair 5700x3d sorry listing popping trying get better deal xd
6800xt thats kinda simimar gpu im dilemma tbh
150 package unlikely
im comparing 9800x3d old non x3d cpu im comparing 5700x3d
upgraded mostly cyberpunk getting 7075 fps rt moment activated rt couldnt get 45 fps even set every setting low get 6575 fps rt ultra
yeah better idea upgrade cpu gpu cpu motherboard ram still limited old gpu
thought would like 600mhz lower 5600x havent found single game performed worse
leonlaptops store suggest wait little bit receive cpu confirm everything fine
need remind 23 week people country bought cpu 1st january got like week ago gls really slow
100 ram anyone buying motherboard youre planning keeping 5 year eventually dropping 9800x3d 11800x3d isnt isnt buying 100 motherboard youre going youre thinking need last 5 year id better make sure ive got pci express 5 enough usb c port nvme slot better need good vrms price start racking quick
am5 guaranteed last 2027 iirc thats true people arent going need upgrade unless theyre really old hardware 5700x3d people fine 5700x3d run 1440p perfectly bottleneck gpu
please tell modern game 5700x3d struggling lol
totally honest im good 60 fps anything 100 fps really cant tell anything 60 terrible though ruined console
marvel rival bo6
4090 aforementioned fps marvel rival bo6 1440p
cpu limited scenario maybe ie 1080p ultra high refresh rate gaming difference miniscule 4k justify buying whole new platform
expensive
play 4k would worth play 1440p wouldnt recommend
cs2 get mote gain significant margin best metric base everything
want save money get bang buck go 5700x3d want absolute best gaming mean grab 9800x3d 2x162x242x32gb 60006400 memory decent timing
one thing much depends game play path exile 2 go 4060fps 120fps 5700x3d 9800x3d pc game notice zero difference
pay 17 euro 21 euro hat there always risk
super tempting
update receive
get something like asrock board like 110 buck acceptable vrm temp literally like 1 lost performance pcie 5 4 even 5090 talking less 5fps loss getting several hundred fps begin really 1 usb c enough need like oculus link pcvr something ideally whole point upgrading absolute top dont upgrade long time right end platform support elongate gap necessary upgrade op already 5700x3d 5800x3d would said nah point upgrading yet upgraded 5700x3d like 2 year ago really
completely agree though tell difference 60 100 fps big difference 60 wellanything 60 lol time consider needing upgrade performance drop 60 consistently
depends game ive seen data much 3040 increase card 4070ti super 1440p 4k difference cpu 5800x3d 7800x3d 9800x3d game zero difference see game video found quickly httpsyoutube52dot0spm0qsi6ebk4fl6dntwo37f game releasing recently anyways show obvious improvement better capable cpu space marine 2 one know scale faster cpu higher resolution
update seems stock right
two game video see increase greater 510 fps 4k new am5 chip definitely worth throwing current motherboard ram 5700x3d 200 7800x3d 9800x3d 350 upwards
thank
example god war result 100fps higher 1440p 4k game zero im trying convince upgrade prof cpu upgrade provide large increase performance gpu im pushing back assertion 4080 super able keep paired 5700x3d come qualifier good enough great like said depending youre playing could leaving way 10 performance table said access microcenter bundle deal make quite affordable switch am5 dont piece together make expensive
something wacky going gow benchmark youtuber done video isnt 100fps gap httpsyoutubemunkc7bmcwt638siq5608kbi044fmm httpsyoutubehepdss4o1uct649sihkezs7xs46lycqgt

work make sure buy 4 new stick dont try reuse existing one

im gon na honest thats lot money could prolly build pc amount going perform much better
ive seen jump high 120fps loading screen im running medium graphic setting
dont know recommendation part ancient need upgraded easiest way cheap bundle like one linked pick motherboard r5 5600
referring high fps part thing went ad looked economy route another posted put stuff cart 5500 b450
much 3060 great card especially 12gb
sure youre looking play new game double video memory access dlss definitely help get extra horsepower rt might question still least hardware grant access rthardware accelerated game like indiana jones turn rt setting minimum id shoe make sure test 3060 thoroughly purchase somebody could trying dump borked card doesnt show symptom right away id want testing first
definitely worth thats basically 160 3060
hope play game like indiana jones doom dark age need gpu ray tracing 3060 allow
testing make sure aint borked card im quite newbie term running test second hand stuff thanks advance
heavenvalley getting pretty old gpu repair place still use stability testing theyre good enough good enough theyre free httpsbenchmarkuniginecomheavenhttpsbenchmarkuniginecomheaven there benchmark button top left press complete full pas thats good sign would keep preset extreme use monitor max resolution actually second thought 1440p probably enough 4k display ideally would want run full suite test probably dont want spend day seller house vice versa yeah dont forget keep eye temperature right hand corner stats 80c isnt unusual heavy load though 90c could indicate cooling problem cooling problem solved though maybe need undervolt new fan curve really easy though maybe need repaste hard involved requires taking gpu apart choice want continue pop anyway hope thats help
ok used gpu maybe spend 100200 used 3090 3090 ti would significantly better choice running llm locally downgrade cpu 7600 get additional budget gpu
cuda support crucial important vram many case simply model either run poorly amd need find whether cuda needed may provide severe benefit
use computer
could buy am5 cpu motherboard ddr5 gpu gon na look outdated comparionsstill capable gpu btw advice try get hand 5700x3d focus remained budget towards graphic card upgrade
purely gaming editing
recommend purchasing new amd cpu first gpu vice versa
step 1 buy 5700x3d step 2 upgrade graphic card
thank much reply really appreciate help one final question curiosity sake would suggest upgrading cpu first ensure bottleneck simply 3900x older processor
3900x good processor heyday instantly see fps uplift better 1 low improvement
bottlenecking myth good serious note would prob buy 9800x3d go 5080 pc monster point go full crazy
mobo solid save like 20 going b650 pro r imo id stick got probably one better bang buck mobos anything 180 already cheaper side am5 mobos however youre gaming stick 76007600x easiest way trim fat 7700x barely better twice price
thats already pretty low end motherboard youre gaming going 7500f 7600 7600x best bet
second youre going able shave 20 downgrade chipset saving switching ryzen 5 even saving different gpu particular reason youre going 7900xt there good gpus half price
httpswwwtechspotcomreview2633amdb650motherboards right good review couple b650 chipset mobos easy link like 2 batch review definitely worth read become familiar need want a620 b850 though still relevant
im also video editing current motherboard sufficient

would like use pc video editing high performance game think might need 7900xt im sure mother board cpu bottleneck though
dont kind work cant say certain generally motherboard spec arent super important decisive piece build make sure enough usbsataplugin port need general review confirm reliable im wrong im sure someone else chime youre editing ramcpustorage matter understand
ok thank
also im video editing alongside gaming 7600 7700 better
imo still 7600x overall performance difference like less 5 however youre still unsure price point 7700x might well consider 9600x 9700x well 9700x cheaper 7700x amazon wo sale lol
every regular motherboard compatible whatever power supply might bottleneck mostly depends game youre looking kind setting youre using
see would doesnt mean take approach would downgrade list ryzen 5600x b550 motherboard 16gb ram save money wont make huge difference performance would spend money make pc good pc gpu something like 7700xt would make difference imo
hello notice youre missing cpu cooler would recommend thermalright peerless assassin 120 build list look good 1080p would consider powerful gpu better quality ssd anything hope help
gpu ssd would recommend
refer motherboards manual
mobo manual saids wifi wireless module preinstalled m2 keyeslot im sure mean supposed something m2 ssd explanation would much appreciated

always people looking cheaper build could even try find kid trying get pc gaming make killer deal upgraded ryzen 7 1700 build 3950x build moved plex pc built 7800x3d build moved 3950x build son gaming pcmy plex pc 1700 build went wife sims lol always us internally want keep sell full build facebook marketplace something
personally tend salvage carry much stuff possible new build usually cooler psu case tend always good side thing reusable go ssds im keeping rig secondary role htpc putting thing office business stuff really old give away charity digital divide arent old may try sell working pc whole add value
there definitely market put combo people may ask part consider combo isnt selling whole rhardwareswap offerup craigslist facebook marketplace
would say never sell hard drive especially flashcell based memory mined information bit overthetop crazy know know data data hdd hit dban first recently sold cpumoboramtower full thing get rid people like buy set combo
start combo one want split sold yesterday x570 5600 2x8 gb 3600 cl36 500 ssd also offer individual part price would
probably easier sell set used motherboards much less demand likely wont get much something better nothing feel like ebay even problem best place sell kind thing
turn plex server
set possible less hassle usually get money selling piece piece market absolutely stuff mobo cpu sell least 50100 buck piece ia absolutely worth money
last upgrade sold bundle made sense since thats everyone going put motherboard anyway older i7 16gb ddr3 ram
rhardwareswap
give friend
ever replace part sell old system
probably listed separately people bought everything motherboard
always keep hard drive eminently reusable cheap small m2 usb enclosure thing
always list set wind selling separate someone ultimately want 1 thing
personally give old stuff away son need upgrade friendsfriends kid would benefit time ill prob give mobocpuram partnmers brother skint pretty big upgrade generally keep m2 drivesssds usually mobocpuram
short answer many wouldnt sell extra motherboard cpu ram useful testing part future backup good upgrading friend pcbuilding someone cheap pc
nothing worth selling
thought making i79700k sort home server maybe put linux would work fine got case power supply storage dont really need reason spend money get missing component ive got enough project guess try listing facebook marketplace nothing lose
im keeping case larger m2 drive psu gpu new system wont working pc sell use motherboard cpu dram boot nvme question part dont run
cant effectively wipe m2 drive
would say never sell hard drive especially flashcell based memory mined information bit overthetop crazy know know data data hdd hit dban first dont give disk encryption password buyer dont disk encryption password well
list
list
also yes selling combo thing dont overcharge nobody paying 100 4th gen
yea originally plex pc running 20 case microcenter lol cheap storage psu spent maybe 80 buck total get running plexstorage pc
im boat currently 9600k build 7600x3d part sitting floor dont really need another pc maybe would nice one garage look stuff play music working car something idk dont even work garage often
see either try list bundle expect people ask maybe part eg maybe someone want motherboard fried rest system see cant move explode part
zeroing secureerasing drive make data unrecoverable anyone isnt able reverseengineer drive firmware andor desolder chip read directly secure erase properly implemented make data unrecoverable even way check secureerasing paying data recovery company using full disk encryption giving buyer password make data unrecoverable anyone hasnt compromised physical digital security advance acquiring drive window user data also recoverable microsoft anyone able compromise microsoft convince microsoft acting color law

modern ssd drive secure erase feature allows truly reset drive sending specific command generally need bios motherboards bootable usb stick running something like parted magic
major second hand marketplace site country also hw forum time sold forum sell section
ebay price fairly competitive sold listing
ship buyer
yep
ive also tried resetting cmos battery tried configuring ram every way possible didnt work
hello motherboard installed case already
tried messing around ram slot 2 4 cpu power plugged
yes
like really double check plugged plug like hidden behind heat sink know lot people completely missed
would try removing motherboard case try booting way may extra standoff somewhere creating short know pain motherboard bad youll remove anyway
well thing pc start every time running doesnt recognize cpu there signal monitor debug light took case id rewire everything
agree would removing variable help narrow issue better motherboard issue youll remove case anyway building pc always best practice boot pc outside case first specifically reason make troubleshooting way easier
took redid everything exact issue

look like solid pick youre willing little bit patient cpu msrp 100 less maybe try getting price budget cl30 ram technically faster realistically youre probably going notice huge difference around good build though dont one already get nice 1440p high refresh monitor youre good go
look overall good personally would make change httpspcpartpickercomlistw6l8jn cpu better price performance cooler solution enough 9800x3d affordable motherboard faster ram better ssd rx 7900xt sale slightly cheaper case 3 pre installed fan rgb version cost 10 buck slightly cheaper psu
thats great hear thanks lot saving ill probably wait little cpu ill definitely look cl30 ram 1440 monitor next list
thank much ill def swap like ram ssd budget really soft cap im sticking case really dont mind spending fan 7900 sale great find appreciate help
gpu planning getting 9800x3d build youll need lot power make full use 4k 240hz monitor

monitor absolutely reason compromise 9800x3d bust buying sort screen 5700x3d make sense
am5 future proof option still supported still getting new cpu ddr5 ram 4k need good gpu still enough budget left good gpu run 4k would say go am5
higher resolution load go gpu less cpu remeber test 9800x3d showed real difference 5800x3d 4k gpu big bottleneck many test resolution test want cpu bottleneck comparison advice play gpu heavy game 4k send stuff back get 5700x3d wait am6 overview 1440p4k test result httpshardforumcomthreadsmost9800x3dreviewslacked1440pand4kgamingbenchmarksbutifoundsome2037755

definitely stick 9800x3d afford
oddly relevant video popped feed right saw post lol httpsyoutubemajjc4xmbb0sikvvidovlixcr1l7a

get expensive 2019 build relatively steal compared
oh damn really interesting video thanks
whole setup minus gpu 2500 albeit high end part gpu alone cost half lol gpu market super shit

stated white motherboard price range didnt say wanted pcie gen 5 aesthetic
yes 9800x3d us less 100w 99 use case 7900xt 300w i914900ks rtx 5090 answer different
750w work well wont cause issue setup
youre paying 2500 favor get 1000w like 100 extra less dont want upgrade 2 thing future decide want new gpu psu provides requested energy case 1000 750 cost wise exactly one less thing worry year unless rtx 608090 like 800w would crazy
appreciate quick answer getting concerned bit haha
psu provides requested energy case 1000 750 cost wise exactly entirely read psu efficiency curve
hypothetically could upgrade way 14900ks chip degradation problem intel claim fixed
14600k would somewhat reasonable upgrade even hb series motherboard youll vrm limited high box turbo boost speed help gaming workload bios must updated prior installing new cpu
really reason update cpu imo possible performance gain isnt worth investment probably get put money higher end gpu
affected user id say less delay inevitable rather solves problem like loose bandage
dont want risk man 13th gen safer i5 13600kf available good price keep mobo ram get better cooler currently 212
degradation issue fixed msi b660ma good vrm
sure play 1440p
13th 14th gen issue could also get 12900k
dont wan na risk better go option opinion
14600k really afflicted either way need update bios latest installing contains newest microcode damage occurs run outdated bios likely affect 14600k first place since doesnt use much powervoltage i7i9 skus
used 3rd gen i5 last year game rely gpu especially want hit monitor refresh rate exception game build large city factory ton background calculation run simulation fine current cpu
check require psu upgrade currently corsair 650watt
good upgrade latest bios issue
untrue 12400f bottleneck 5070ti hard 1440p old 12500 even bottlenecking 3080ti
one rare time enthusiastically say buy 14600k upgrading existing motherboard make ton sense especially chip fire sale next gen intel chip barely faster getting am5 level performance ddr4 next 23 year
bottlenecking misused term cpu bottleneck would get exact fps 5070 4090 5080 isnt case yes fps game would improved upgrading cpu amount would invest per frame make bad investment spending money somewhere else would impact

shouldnt compatibility issue bottle necking likely highly depends youre gaming 4k cyberpunk highest setting yeah youll fine playing c 1080p yeah gpu waste money cpu holding back heavily
depends monitor 4k much gpu much work anyway start lowering resolution start bottlenecking 9800x3d powerful gaming cpu market rn bottleneck 1440 make fps 1080 typically 4k youre proobably overkill case plan upgrading doesnt matter get youre lucky upgrade watch gamers naxus hardware unboxed review see
compatability shouldnt problem assuming big enough power supply havent seen benchmark cpugpu combo cant say exactly much bottleneck youll
lot game wan na rt max plan getting 4k oled upgrading cpu well really play siege league rust cpu heavy game rust could use better cpu tbh every game 1440 144 solid
9800x3d cart amazon like line na lem get 5090 first thinking waiting till 9700x3d tbh phd machine learning stats 9950x3d work load gaming
might cop new power supply luckily theyre expensive gon na make sure fit current case
uh r6 siege league heavily cpu bound hello
r6 league already get stable 1440 144hz easy never issue drop like said rust game id consider upgrading cpu first wan na get 5090 play max tray traced game cyber punk minecraft crazy shaders portal rtx etc lot single player game ive saving land 5090 im also buying 4k 240hz oled monitor ill work comp game comp game fine 1440 144 want beautiful single player game though played red dead saw much missing stopped playing till get better gear im excited edit sound mad though hurt
u u hurt alrdy know everything dont ask advice u want advice dont bite hand trying help cya
dont know everyone asked compatibility issue checked part checker wanted see anyone experience tip offered rich af guess wouldnt asking
upgrade lga 1151 split 2 version compatible 6 7 8 9 cant put 9 6 board
socket determine compatibility motherboard bios cpu microcode supported hp board wont work cpu hp shipped model machine likely i56500t i76700t even 7000 series chip would otherwise supported non oem motherboards order use i79700 would need buy new motherboard case power supply minimum expensive old chip might well buy newer generation part prebuilt point

higher hz 1080p doesnt really make sense going play 60 fps 1440p monitor noticeably sharper 1080p dont think help badly implemented aa tho might also like extra screen space 27 inch monitor
1440p cant go wrong resolution plenty pixel multitask much sharper imagebut many pixel itll put tremendous strain gpu get best world
high refresh rate pointless plan 60fps get benefit sharpness clarity picture want higher resolution 1440p monitor sound like would ideal setup
define aaa gaming thats kind broad category youre looking best quality single player title dont require heavy ray tracing extreme quality 1440p youre gon na playing esports stuff like cod may benefit higher refresh rate 1080p 6750 great 1440p card sufficient 1080p heavy rt stuff turned really depends specific game youre
get least 120144hz monitor
buddy bought 1080p 27inch two week ago immediately bought another one 1440p cuz full hd fine 27 believe
save 20 buck get 144hz 1440p
mean u technically overclock 1440p monitor 110120hz
1080p dinosaur resolution day 1440p 144hz 27 minimum 34 ultrawide preferred changing computer many time often changing monitor dont skimp monitor get good deal demo model return got 400 monitor 200 tiny scratch cant even see another got 900 monitor 400 returned single defective pixel cant even see unless know exactly look
mean high quality single player graphically demanding title like final fantasy rebirth cyberpunk rdr2
1440p may turn setting wont able use thing like ultra ray tracing able handle game yes 1440p definitely look better 1080p youre right lot antialiasing setting suck may want search people opinion similar gpusystem every game reddit page google likely help find post discus best setting quality
thank help

anything recommend replace
great thank
whats budget
around 700800
still good totally outdated worth buying
head rbuildapcforme look pinned post good starting point
okay thanks
id little concerned 750w gold power supply know part picker estimating 600650 watt load im sure newegg thinking bit power money dumped 4080 7800x3d might bad idea get bit power aim platinum titanium rated supply always bit sketchy getting psu thats already near max capacity system suggestion id also consider 360mm ensure youre getting heat away x3d maximize cpu performance able mount 360mm front panel get exhaust top rear pull air another premium thing invested last build braided atx cable modular power supply yeah cost bit money route bit better stay really clean cable routing especially comb keep organized look really nice afterwards well lastly thermal paste thermal grizzly duronaut arctic mx6 definitely better thermal interface solution whatever come aio happy building
thank mate exactly stuff need know also hear there type bracket thats recommended mounting aio cpumotherboard called
hmmmmm didnt need gigabyte x570 master didnt need least dont remember anything aio cooler come mounting bracket attache mobo part come aio cooler got ekwb beat back went totally financially crazy hardware look like youre right track
one thing youre already getting 4080 super thought waiting trying get 5080 msrp similar 4080 super right sure release happening australia 5080 coming usa thursday youre spending money maybe get extra 1520 performance bump extra ai frame
good point check benchmarking see performance difference two released yet think au releasing 50 series tomorrow
review embargo 5080 ending tomorrow think start seeing review tomorrow msrp 1000 usd think thats 4080 super today definitely worth bit research youre gon na drop hefty coin gear imho
look cheer brother
seems fine
httpsmyoutubecomwatchvmho0m1ns0rw go talk fan setup quite detailed
ideally want exactly 0 intake fan bait want psu intake air beneth pc every fan exhaust want least 2 top case rest back dont need frontal
saw someone saying intake fan exhaust fan wondering get case capable fan
ideally sure help prevent dust build majority intake filtered fan mesh instead random hole slot practice doesnt matter much open pc periodically clear dust
oh people talking positive air pressure prevent dust case yes might stick h7 flow thanks
yes logic positive air pressure push air tiny hole instead sucking said tiny difference practice
youre life saver thanks
dont follow youre asking cpu isnt even bad
yikes thats workstation computer us xeon chip looking use computer
answer page 4
im wondering brand cpu compatible pc cpu thats right xeon silver 4114 10 core really outdated
itll work cpu listed pdf linked
xeon chip huh guess ill buy budget one performs okay
there another one thats going lot better youd need new motherboard depending nonstandard pc probably new thing well
drive show behaviour extreme extent others unusual p3 plus also loses significant speed filled
identical maybe manufacturer mixandmatch component product including drive probably httpswwwtechpowerupcom290339psakingstonnv1ssdcomeswithahardwarespeclotterytlcorqlcsmiorphison additionally many drive hit wall writing quickly around 25 full httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewkingstonnv11tb6html
know usually happens disk drive 7090 tho
thanks thats messed known wouldnt buy
youre going get better performance window 10 losing support youre going change o regardles switched linux avoid window 11 thats option window 11 kinda option
want security update much difference really window 11 used downgrade performance nowadays give sometimes better performance couple video tech tuber httpsyoutubeizqezmjtfumsitnq1dvfutxgxvrh httpsyoutubeabxkduesfkssi8nclqerjoe0dujo
worth sorta always us 20 ram need get 128gb see happens far bloated bit like forza im student im currently stuck highly recommend linux currently use
thing swapped linux got fed trying get new window install working frustration tried linux found even easier use window last year
window 10 lose support
asked another question opinion input help appreciated
october 14 microsoft offer extended security update 3 year cost one device 61 year 1 122 year 2 224 year 3 point window 10 100 unsupported
october
newer win 11 support end october iirc
downside going window 11 microsoft going nuclear spyware hard locking hardware level feature steam o release sometime soon want avoid window altogether
problem since pretty much choice upgrade bought window 10 oem key upgrade process buy another oem key window 11 continue without fucking anything
im pretty sure dont need another key upgrade system

nope wont work fastest cpu gaming motherboard support 5700x3d 7700x requires new motherboard ram
okay thank gpu good tho
yes
kind issue ram instability cause want sure always run memtest make sure ram working properly
try zero issue tested yet issue expo either turned almost immediately qflashing board take 9900x
hard beat power console cost thats price range may better console
id recommend steam deck price point
could get really cheap pc even steam deck connect tv use chiaki stream ps5
hop pcpartpicker see there build price range know get money could also check used rig come gta 6 might better getting ps5 im sure youd need decent pc run well might even drop pc launch
buy used part get close ps5 performance price
thing suck really dont play much compared average gamer feel want cheap one dont wan na pay 100 year play occasionally pc one time payment sit 6 month choose play waste half year membership hand dont wan na buy 2000 pc play hyper focus game wan na come home play work every day lol
reason dont want ps5 dont want pay monthly yearly play game online im also dumbass worried ill get virus computer lol

check motherboards manufacturer support site ram configuration depends product number part number ram stick validated 2 4 dimm configuration
use 4 stick 16gb ddr5 6000 cl40 issue ive game dont like overclock memory leave xmp turned go route use 4 exact stick best bet keep old ram buy 2 32gb plenty gaming task like uvettelstark91 said motherboard website ram compatible motherboard deviate manufacturer compatibility list
cpu 5200mhz pretty likely work four dimms mix 2x8 2x16gb speed timing xmp work otherwise manually set
unlikely cause usually explosion psu related though suppose also avoid hand grenade plastic explosive like well faulty vrms

yes however radiator normally come static pressure fan push radiator case fan normally air flow optimized less pressure
oh ok wouldnt problem temperature something like
using air flow fan radiator lead slightly higher temp
oh ok thanks well id rather use noctua improves temperature thats fine wanted aesthetic match color
raid 0 going speed raid 1 redundancy ive never ran m2 raid set sata ssds running raid 0 absolutely make difference
yes raid 1 improve read speed nothing write speed data written drive reading drive contains copy read half file one drive half cutting time half
httpsyoutubecvmzeqgd5ksiogghnl9dd4zcfxdv httpsyoutubenynnlfpklsasittnyp1nksh9lcmb httpsyoutube2tn5slkpwzmsiovwyiy0gl556btst
raid 1 wont meaningfully boost read speed modern nvme ssds designed data mirroring rather performance want raw speed dont care redundancy single highend gen5 ssd raid 0 setup would appropriate generally raid 1 redundancy performance gain
also speed isnt readwrite speed really talked latency speed discontinued intel optane drive amazing low latency even dont speed readwrite speed modern drive still beat lot modern drive latency httpswwwtomshardwarecomfeaturesssdbenchmarkshierarchysection1tbssdhierarchy look 95852 random iop even top drive 45k 50k iop random read generally gon na important game think us

raid 1 realy increasing read speed one drive busy io second drive handling next request time slow writing speed data must written twice
wouldnt raid 0 going raw performance would split 1 file onto two drive used mechanical drive ssd introduced became redundant performance gain
feel insane double read speed effectively 24000mbs isnt everyone
found admittedly didnt watch patience run thin video give second look though thank
thank first tech post reddit usually find need without asking help haha wasnt sure post question honest check also tell he wrong talked im confident doesnt need wanted understand thought something could help customer may future dont work hardcore gamers haha
raid 1 shouldnt slow write speed written twice two drive sharing work take approximately amount time 1 drive writing
im saying good plan raid 1 get improved read speed without risking data single drive failure
pcie 50 drive storage speed usually arent bottleneck anymore worth losing much capacity extra speed wasted customer computer
expensive people dont need read speed gen5 ssds already kind pointless consumer increased speed gen4 drive brings little benefit outside benchmark
pay 2 drive get one drive worth capacity read speed fast enough worth

future storage related question like said rdatahoarders great community topic
yep array must report completed writting possible drive done one drive may busy something else another read proceed array delay slowest operation time covering cache
also half capacity youre buying two drive getting capacity one dont care data integrity theyre better running raid 0 raid 1 least get capacity drive plus faster writes way
flight sim agree drive speed going biggest factor performance supporting article information read want understand
even pcie 30 doubt storage bottleneck anytime soon
thank much information seeing real world performance modern pc looking pretty much aligns expected pc behave still curious raid tech speed applicable professional consumer using nonserver setup like medium creation system
number 4 incorrect raid 1 number 5 outright wrong numerous software raid option available
raid 1
fair point
wow complete waste money make exactly zero difference game whatever money read httpsenmwikipediaorgwikistandardraidlevels
point 5 wrong motherboard need support raid otherwise wont able even set let alone use board doesnt raid support need dedicated raid controller however ive said motherboard today form basic raid setup least noticeable technically speaking raid software matter whats interpreting point 4 apply raid 1 specifically wasnt talking raid 1 rather raid 0 topic increasing speed via raid raid 1 doesnt actually increase speed fact bit slower fastest drive raid need speed increase concern data reliability parity mirroring use raid 0 point 4 applies main benefit raid 1 reduction latency request serviced drive especially noticeable spinning disk due way work unless specific filesystem andor raid controller optimization wont actually get faster read speed raid 1
raid 1 mirroring doesnt improve speed far know raid 6 hand requires 4 drive
zero difference agree waste money pair wd black ssds already pretty quick ssd unused got lab equipment work already spent money wasnt expecting much improvement damn loading time cyberpunk helldivers 2 roughly halved mean nobody really care 3 second 15 unless die lot make noticeable difference
okay im talking though ive read wikipedia bunch article following excerpt specifically wikipedia posted seeing directly support significant improvement read speed raid 1 array missing something read request serviced handled drive array thus depending nature io load random read performance raid 1 array may equal sum member performancea write performance remains level single disk however disk different speed used raid 1 array overall write performance equal speed slowest disk1415 synthetic benchmark show varying level performance improvement multiple hdds ssds used raid 1 setup compared singledrive performance however synthetic benchmark also show drop performance comparison
ngl pc built day overkill nice information arsenal 1 might apply
point 5 wrong motherboard need support raid otherwise wont able even set continue confidently incorrect dont need motherboard fakeraid support set software raid like mdadm storage space zfs etc raid 1 doesnt actually increase speed maybe google stuff make sure correct proclaiming reddit
thank explanation aligning understanding raid article link data read wikipedia preferably something released last year 10 year ago
explained first post raid 1 improve read speed
interesting wouldnt expect noticeable improvement speed ssds
random read performance raid 1 array may equal sum member performance sum member performance drive 1 read speed plus drive 2 read speed yeah important always going much depending whats read
x2
officially 7300mbs crystal disk mark say getting pretty close around low 7000s raid got 13350mbs sequential read random read didnt see much bump
okay make sense im embarrassingly bad math haha however article referencing 10 year old tech testing benchmark nowhere near speed current hardware know current research
2x 2 drive 3x 3 drive etc might less hypothetical number
hypothetical 2 drive scenario get significantly diminished return performance increased risk definitely worth
say side mean front intake
im air engineer doesnt sound like good idea sound like impact airflow bad way assuming youre talking back would front fan pulling air air need get travel back meet another intake fan hot air circulate little essentially 2 pull opposite side doesnt sound great im air professional idk might talking shit
dont post picture case give detail general yes bottom would intake top would exhaust number intake must equal greater exhaust would want maintain positive pressure inside case force hot air outside also affecting would cpu gpu fan positioned
front full 360mm intake pushpull bottom 420mm intake 420mm exhaust top 240mm exhaust back right side spot two fan one top one bottom havent installed two yet deciding orientation figure enough exhaust might much figure intake bottom right exhaust top right intake shouldnt affected exhaust top space figured would ask around see anyone experience knowledge area
whats spec possibly need bios update
make sure using correct ram slot also try using 1 stick time see help
amd ryzen 5 7600x amd radeon rx 7600 xt
two ram slot thats right cpu tried uninstalling one ram didnt work
long waited turning pc
probably 10 minute
experiment moving one top 120mm fan using rear exhaust temp improve answer
yes rear fan important
listed tier psu good rating cybernetics purchased one use one computer far seems fine honestly cant hear gpu system im certain fan ever come anyway

get 1tb m2 ssd motherboard slot clone system keep hdd storage
oh god yes get ssd really want window though get pain fresh window install use existing drive editas secondary youll still file hdd youll reinstall application
youre treat get ssd keep hdd like backup storage something dont nvme slot motherboard even 25 regular ssd colossal difference youre experiencing 1tb suffice brand like samsung crucial pretty good usually go crucial mx500 need get 25 ssd go sale frequently
ssd single best performance per dollar upgrade pc doesnt already one best single component upgrade regard performance price motherboard doesnt m2 slot still get sata ssd would hook way existing drive ideally youd set usb drive window installer remove existing drive replace empty ssd install window thumb drive could still use hard drive storage drive get enclosure use external drive

tried research able upgrade bios work hope research involved looking manufacturer cpu support listhttpswwwgigabytecommotherboardgaab350gaming3rev1xsupportsupportcpu answered definitively upgrade processor nothing else good enough play 60 fps whats gpu cpu usage gaming moment gpu already pegged 100 upgrading cpu wont help quick google search marvel rival gtx1060 turned uphttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvavq4qsgfakq ryzen 7 3700x gtx1060 6gb even hitting 60 fps 1080p lowest one 1060 3gb cpu limited 4790khttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfebsa5dwsn8 money gpu limited rather cpu limited upgrade 5800x wont make difference think something like rx 6650xt rx 6600 might different price used market may give looking said cpu minimum spec
yes 4k resolution gpu generally important cpu especially gaming however since youre focusing photo video editing cpu choice still matter video editing software like premiere pro davinci resolve rely heavily cpu performance task like rendering encoding timeline scrubbing ryzen 7700 solid choice workload includes heavy video editing color grading effect higherend cpu core like 12core option could offer better longterm performance depends budget
7700 like 300 yes 4k gpu bound still benefit better cpu time
cpu doesnt care resolution quality setting itll run game frame time regardless set note frame time frame rate long take execute single game update gpu hand care greatly resolution quality setting 4k especially hard render gpu take longer render frame cpu cpu waiting gpu frame rate thus whatever gpu current game gpu limited 4k getting 7600 v 9800x3d make little difference frame rate see legitimately game today still cpu limited 4k even 9800x3d assuming 4080 4090 likely game future well thats say shouldnt go 7700 game wont see benefit 7700 already excellent gaming cpu say 9800x3d isnt entirely pointless 4k id also say come am5 gaming real choice 7600 7600x 9600 9600x 7800x3d 9800x3d 7600 7700x gaming performance difference tiny single digit percentage difference enable pbo 7600 7700x perform functionally exactly 7600 7600x cheaper want use stock cooler x suffix version include 9600x faster gaming 7700x even pbo enabled 7700x 9600x less expensive kind logical step 9700x ever slightly faster still worth 100 price increase 7800x3d massive 2530 performance increase beyond 9600x 9800x3d another 2030 beyond 700x cpu add two core good system want additional multithreaded performance nongaming application gaming even gaming streaming really useful
4k like zero context info even 5090 cant run max setting several game mean need use upscaling jump decentgood frame rate mean lower internal render resolution mean cpu becomes important especially talking new dlss transformer model turned even performance mode actually usable
5700x3d pretty optimal 4k120 case notcompletelyinsane priced gpu 7600x better modern non x3d cpu going pretty good unless youre playing 4080 better youre going benefit much better cpu run optimised setting fps target even 3090 isnt going max 5800x3d case youre also pretty much line gpu wise youre running rt youre destroying image anyway much upscaling balance within budget optimise setting leave room growth dont go crazy buying performance youre going use might upgrade year midrange outpace whatever current high end option anyway say got 7700x 4k120 144hz display gpu actually afford thats going affect answer
needed since youre talking using money towards gpu mean youre buying 5090 probably gpu would actually matter rtx 4070 type card ryzen 7700 fine dont know 7700 150 though sound like scam
needed beneficial yes 9950x3d come march btw
nope performance gain 1080p pretty negligible go like 7600x take saving shove better gpu gpu always limiting factor 4k

sama 2351 black argb atx case 4 x 120mm argb fan plan shipping pc across world glasssided case seem good idea
going college youre likely going lot space considered itx build much easier move
depends much ship could put box case come check plane might cheaper shipping might even free need one suitcase international flight allow 2 checked item id probably remove gpu however bring separately suitcase carry
wait get set college
get college first may end tight living space full size pc would hard manage size wise itx build expensive build would use gaming laptop start also wait till get get feel budget making large purchase thing may pricier expected way didnt take account
looking option amount space tower case take itx doesnt seem significant also like look medium tower case biggest thing concerned price
probably use anti static foam well
money set aside purely pc ive saving dont think itx pc wont make much difference space wise concern based wouldnt able find similar pc price point
fair enough big deal either way keep gpu box much safer ship case aio fine leave installed bad idea take well
box case come already designed shipped foam protection need gpu thing really get damaged since graphic card big way mounted could stuff inside case bubble wrap something around gpu secure id advise removing trip safe foam outside case wouldnt worry static

complicated short answer long answer run four stick especially find 16gb enough may find cant run 3600 mt run four run config channel ie 8gb 16gb per channel whats rest system spec detail singlerank module xmp profile good chance work platform 8gbs running 3600 mt might see little performance improvement interleaving mix singlerank dualrank three rank per channel whether work less certain four rank per channel far harder run xmp speed wont hit xmp much question extra capacity offset loss performance
theyre speed there penalty running 4x stick ddr4 thats ddr5 high speed overclocked ddr5 specifically 2x8 2x16 work 48gb dual channel put alternating slot also fyi 2x32gb kit ddr4 like 90 2x16gb might overpaid
sure cpu price high australia buying one aliexpress would especially make sense getting aio 6core ryzen chip waste unless want aesthetic tower cooler easily cool trying find cl 30 ram sure price
long cpu updated bios
thermal paste would easy cheap one check similar thing going bought new cooler upon removing old one found old thermal paste crazy degraded probably would fine id repasted doesnt fix problem youre like 10 buck
ive since 2022 never updated bios
yeah good point thinking try thermal paste first replace cooler

compatability problem build youre wasting money suspect already know
dont see compatibility issue would probably go ahead get arctic liquid freezer 420 instead 360 since case support price similar id also use 140mm fan wherever supported know picked lot component much expensive need without providing much functionality using gaming

prob fun upgrade
hmm work 9000 series fine since mobo support cpu ddr5 checked make sure ram properly seated easy get quite way go unnoticed barely tell
also depend motherboard high quality z370z390 fwiw though difference 320034663600 small particularly intel set xmp reduce clock speed memory stability test call day
surprising ddr4 intel system run 4 stick 3600mts cl18 without problem curiosity still running old stick side note xmp make oc easier guaranty cpu motherboard combo actually hit xmp speed try increase ca 18 updating latest motherboard firmware
cpu doesnt need ram fast came 3600mhz wasnt super common like
combination motherboard memory controller cpu likely sure would want 3600 mt 8700k though 8th gen intel really doesnt benefit much fast ram
old 8700k ran four stick ddr43600 fine xmp speed highend z390 motherboard exception though rule cpu memory controller isnt snuff motherboards memory trace minutely imperfect ram wont work high speed run ddr43200 doesnt work 3600 difference academic especially since probably tighten timing quicker stock make difference
mentioned mobo model lower end z370 thats ie reduced speed 3400mhz tested game stability test later
confirm intel imcs good 13900ks blew running 4 stick ddr4 3600mt c34 12100 running 2 stick ddr4 5066mt c20
bios already updated old stick max 34003466 1820204042higher clock lower timing wont boot surprisingly high oc 2666 cl19 stick without heatsinks new stick unstable matter timing voltage
wanted keep stick future upgrade probably overclock possible
yeah entry level z board there chance itd work wouldnt spend much time memory tuning minefield gain miniscule youre gon na spend time tuning focus ocing snot cpu gpu
sorry dude everyone win silicon lottery
fine putting later make sure leave room routing fan cable dont forget get installed booting
need cpu cooler sort installed trying turn pc
id hop car drive nearest electronics store overpay allot tube cooling paste finish build lol
watching good tutorial tell install cooler easiest point reason people said later probably tricky dont try power pc without cooler youll fine though im sure
thank kind stranger
theyre closed lol
probably really simple figure id really appreciate second pair eye opinion thanks much taking time read

b850m differ b850i im getting ready purchase similar sff build
itx board lot smaller wont many io like m2 slot
oh gosh didnt even realize im sffpc sorry dumb question
idk kind laptop likely barely met minimum spec win 11 felt bad system fine really shouldnt take hour look tutorial switch yt
ive upgraded laptop win10 11 also using win11 pc mostly using device gaming experience aside uiux change nothing drastic still fine using win10 dont see reason got win11 aside newer o longer support period also bios tied mobo o tied storage upgrading win11 shouldnt brick mobo even somehow break win11 installation process restart beginning installing storage motherboard
dont brother buggy mess worse window 10
reinstalling window anyway current win10 install still stable performing well there need touch
stay win10 till win12 come soon
unfortunately window 10 loses support later year version upgrade likely order want continued support window made switch linux end running window 11 spare ssd rare occasion need option wont work people option
suck also fine mean get used like hour there nothing dealbreaking fwiw best fresh install upgrade time spent setting new pc software old pc copying file back etc depending complicated current system could take half hour day
thats pretty good system would handle window 11 problem wouldnt upgrade though broke try fix
wait move file setup give option carry
upgrade want keep everything sometimes issue arise eventually necessitate clean install involves totally wiping drive issue usually buggy behaviour device working properly issue sleepwake etc prefer skip step always fresh install save headache troubleshooting case best backup file externally either way try upgrade anything go wrong youre safe
3080 4070s prob wont work well psu think pull 4500 watt remember correctly think 6700xt low power draw
damn didnt know could draw much power older rtx card like 2080ti u think psu handle
never mind im dumb look like 4070super draw 180230 watt depending resolution wouldnt bother 1000 2000 series card since theyre 34 generation old afford 4070super recommend one youre looking itll last next 23 generation easily
m2 pcie slot bandwidth interaction boardspecific board interaction second m2 drive wont affect anything usually find specification part manufacturer page board
omg setup understanding cpu plenty pcie lane 24 gpu using 40 slot mobo m2 using gen 30 also issue intel setup apparently golden
performance loss kind using second m2 drive dont know youve seen thats complete bullshit m2 drive several time faster sata drive price essentially maybe even cheaper installing way easier suggest getting something 2tb larger best value capacity nowadays way easy blow 1tb like nothing large game gotten
ive running multiple m2 drive pc year change performance gpu decrease performance little unnoticeable
m2 sata ssd m2 gpu problem imo get sata difference speed might significant paper practice rather worth extra get 24 gb sata youll fine
even board drop gpu slot x8 would matter rx 7800xt gpu pcie4x8 enough gpu fact 4090 affected dropping 4x8 even percent
thank
board especially budget one share pcie lane second m2 slot gpu gpu normally run x16 slot put second m2 certain motherboards reduce functionality x8 slot instead
isnt b550 motherboard planet function like afaik go anything modern b450 b560 maybe maybe recycled piece shit msi mobo thats b550 board thats really updated b450 model function like thats edge case really b550 chipset borderline scam lol maybe absolute shit a620 model might frankly dont know buy b650 option arent really money time

4070super
perfectly fine gpu compatibility nearly universal nowadays consumer card last 10 year work fine modern system graphic driver
long socket compatible pretty easy required update bios power pc remove cooler clean cpu remove cpu put new cpu put paste cpu put cooler back power computer accept bios prompt new cpu done
6000 overclocking officially rated 5600 still pretty easy overclock little extra practically free performance time work loading expoxmp profile bios setup
super weird check power plan window set max performance changed anything bios ever first update latest version
solution increase long duration power limit 219 watt
based review 5080 v 4080 super think going around 35 performance upgrade mean 3080 ti 5080 5080 seems like 1015 faster 4080s something like terrible gpu vacuum lacking people expected compared previous gen need want new gpu buy one whether mean 5080 used 40804080s4090 depends entirely find much
yes
honestly dont good answer someone similar position plan riding gpu gen 5800x 3080 10g caught used 5800x3d good deal stuffed system cpu job 99 game stalker2 one make weep 1440p youre targeting 4k itll even better 5700x3d current option available retail cant find older chip used job best id grab used 40804080 super 50 jump raw raster 16gb vram dont personally think thats large enough jump performance worth investment effort sell old card make
id mix match current part build new rig wouldnt pair 7900xt 12400 example 1 cpu cooler overkill processor probably original cooler lying around use cpu cooler new build install stock cooler 2 850w psu overkill build buy cheaper 600w psu use build take 850w new build 3 generally secondary build usually smaller case maybe use atx case new build buy smaller case secondary
id definitely pas 3060ti 1080p60 system get something thatll pair better new monitor answer question 7900xt would great grab wanted push newer game youre waiting month two plan swap new gpus horizon could entice rtx 5070ti potentially rx 90709070xt around price range cpu would weaker side also socket thats seen new life breathed insocket upgrade option consider 13600k14600k could slide existing board id avoid i7 i9s vrm solution existing board little light might also need slightly beefier cooler new chip thats ok outgoing 12400f cooler sound like so pc half done handmedown part awesome exact thing

there report corsair rme unit coil whine manufacturing lottery normally quiet alternative case need like adata xpg cybercore super flower leadex iii gold quiet pure power 12
thank thats super helpful one last thing extra cautious looked manual corsair rm850x 2021 couldnt actually find anything regarding connector labeled cpupcie simply plug either cable cpu pcie gpu case meaning portshttpsiimgurcomhidol0kpng used cpugpu however see fit case labeling bit confusing connector actually specific either cpu pcie
reason get 3 instead 1 see site 24 tb one 440 httpspcpartpickercomproductpsyh99seagateexosx2424tb357200rpminternalharddrivest24000nm002h assume there big difference

oh quote didnt really see 3080 ti comparison 5080 based difference current review 5080 v 4080 super performance difference 3080ti 4080 super wouldnt say need gpu right want avoid much depreciation 3080ti use fund buy latest gpu
could work basically aside psu cpu cooler everything could go smaller case become secondary build id case psu cpu cooler primary build would need get everything else still went 7900xt would good cpumotherboard pair
thanks nvidia website amazon pay checkout ill make sure updated get home tonight ever make quicker nvidia hold card cart limited time also remember
wow thing actually black magic idea even yesterday worried screwed fan didnt know better would screwed haha pc like fully quiet jesus christ
go check thanks
jonsbo close aluminum silver colored tho jonsbo look cool admit xd

yes use either pcie cpu actually quite common psus two connector interchangeable cable however need cpu cable cpu connector motherboard pcie cable pcie connector gpu
thats hdd ssd thats slow drive usable need store large file long term maybe video server two 16tb hdds exactly would put modern game loading time would awful
7700x 1400p barely go 80 usage game depending pricing compare 7700x 9700x see better deal
4070s 720 one buy one
still went 7900xt would good cpumotherboard pair recent i5 am5 ryzen 5 would recommend going am5 get 7700x 9700x good price would recommendation
rubber make huge difference getting vibration noise normally decent fan vibrate much reuse rubber btw pull need change fan dont cut
alright great thank much
ok see thank
hdds also make lot noise especially large one 10 tb since homeuser interest hdds started dropping favor ssd nvme manufacturer focused mostly datacenters started removing hdd feature like low noise operation advanced power saving mode model filled helium somewhat quieter zero noise like ssd
look like solid build ive got b550 tomahawk treated well past four year
u price seem
might worth consider going am5 httpsaupcpartpickercomlistjbrnv4httpsaupcpartpickercomlistjbrnv4
im australia
ok thats price seemed everything look good dont think youre paying anything pretty good 1080p gaming rig
yes good make sure psu handle
youve snagged rx 7900 xtx great price want build upgrade topnotch gaming solid pick remember check whole system setup like cooling power need keep everything running smoothly everything fit go ahead grab
good price pull trigger 850w psu
shit question
750w low dont plan overclocking
always power limit necessary run xtx 10 power 15 lose 7 performance great ratio
current price point 7 performance worth buying new power supply
wouldnt rush could wait good sale 1000w wanted use next 10 year
7900 xt 700 also 750w enough xt
yes definitely xtx us significantly power xt xt probably top way 400w
setup look great work really well go well itll handle gaming work task nicely
thank man
like rt nvidia dont like rt amd dlss good shouldnt key point deciding simple also work need cuda whatever obviously go nvidia
would personally pay 818 dollar card 12 gig vram thats
4070 super
resolution less 4k go xt
im personally worried vram dlss4 performance preset good point itll match fsr3 quality youre considering 7800xt youre likely interested ray tracing youre interested rt 4070 super last pretty long 12gb rt usually us 2gb mean youre freeing vram argument 7800xt would money saving id personally wait rx 9070 nonxt youre looking amd cheaper 4070 super arrive large supply fsr4 might close enough dlss4 least dlss35 still get 16gb
personally id wait bit get 9070xt launch supposed rock
best price performance ratio 7800xt 4070 pc 12 expensive 5 better
depends dont care ray tracing want vram go rx 7800xt
rt cuda deciding factor
much better rt much better power efficiency plus undercoatingpower limiting make even better better upscaling nvidia better raster vram help future aaa title supporting underdog amd
hey man internal debate last week 7800 xt purchased saw good deal 4070 super 60usd 7800 xt bought ultimately came fact issue old amd gpu many year ago tearing hair switched 1060 time never single problem im sure amd much better bang buck always good simply trust nvidia card fwiw performance supposed similar two good luck
check 7900 gre well cheaper 4070 super country still ended going 4070 super tho
imho none really good positive really bad negative
find 4070 super right good price let know ive looking month got ta love america sarcastic patriotism noise
rtx
id recommend going amd sapphire nitro 7800 xt would better choice asrock challenger 2 cent
buy 5070 instead 4070 super personally 4070 super considering upgrading 5070 5070 ti
long wait 5070 seems like 4070 super probably wont stock however 9070 9070xt interedting amd could lot stock since already started shipping card retailer originally wanted launch month literally last minute ce decided hold back wait 5070 come
5070 549 msrp usd better performance 4070 super frame rate ai frame smooth smooth
get 7800 xt cheaper better non rt performance 16gb vram compared 4070s 12gb therefore future proof really care ray tracing better ai upscaling go 4070s
dlss4 great go nvidia
id recommend waiting new generation card point cant go 4070s sign current amd card going age horribly theyre undercutting enough really justify lack feature techpowerups average performance early 2024 note following 1440phttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewsapphireradeonrx7900grepulse32html 4070s 7 faster 7800xt 4070s 2 slower 7900gre here update last month bunch 2024 released titleshttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewgputestsystemupdatefor20252html 4070s 15 faster 7800xt 4070s 4 faster 7900gre 7 swing one year let go bigger 2024 title black myth wukonghttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewblackmythwukongfpsperformancebenchmark5html 4070s 26 faster 7800xt nearly fast 7900xt silent hill 2httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewsilenthill2fpsperformancebenchmark5html 4070s 44 faster 7800xt nearly fast 7900xtx dragon age veilguardhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewdragonagetheveilguardfpsperformancebenchmark5html 4070s 21 faster 7800xt star war outlawshttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewstarwarsoutlawsfpsperformancebenchmark5html 4070s 26 faster 7800xt there many game releasing use ue5rt cant turn almost like amd shifted tier compared nvidia already 7 average one year wheres going year especially game like sh2 even pure raster lack rt far bigger problem long term lack vram latter turn setting add fact rdna3 going dead end term feature wont support fsr 4 example theyre cheap enough recommend look way 4070s 15 ahead 7800xt using link op 20 expensive even pure priceperformance barely behind anymore
800 cad equivalent amd personally id rather better raster vram fake frame 800 equivalent 7900 xt better get instead
poay lot cpu intensive game like rival dota valorant good cpu 7800xt else 4070 ti super avoid 4070s less vram
goat helping people
dlss good shouldnt key point deciding dlss key point especially dlss 4 fact fsr 4 coming 7800xt
would also like add like amd cant handle ray tracing nvidia developed better technology like cant still use game fact 7800xt actually run quite well experience
dlss good shouldnt key point deciding would say depends target resolution often plan using upscaler dlss4 make wonder term image clarity available rtx card
honestly best answer fanboyism straight point answer
dlss one biggest factor modern gpus huge selling point considering amd intel arent even close
really read always choose nvidia
except rt dlss use decent chunk vram 12gb aint gon na enough u cant use due low vram go amd instead
cad still much tho agree 12 gb part
inshallah neither card cost much brother
run 7800xt 1920x1080 super resolution cant tell difference 4k average 178fps cyberpunk ultra
calculation work pure raster scenario stand 4070 super use upscaling often aggressively performance gap increase 20 many realistic scenario
gon na beat 4070s
smooth smooth really since frame gen introduces significant amount input lag basically smooth game already running smooth native
someone who used 5080 frame gen frame smooth also laggy youre really pushing limit
7800xt slower raster
post reason didnt pull trigger 7900gre nvidia driver newer game developed way made go hmmm waiting actual 5xxx review real pricing another year 1070
im seeing 7900 xt best buy 200 sale already 1000 cad
4070tis like double price lmao
bro pointing obvious hero wanted hero need
fsr 4 coming 7800xt yet amd exploring rdna3 support fsr 4 httpsengamegpucomironamdstudiespossibilityoffsr4supportforrdna3 nbsp realistically possible rdna3 due ai accelerator rdna 2 probably
idk ton people dont care upscaling much still see non factor
thats true sure amd generation behind come rt people wanting best ray tracing performance still probably prefer nvidia especially demanding title
much fps cp2077 path tracing
there also argument keep gpus long time ai upscaling go longer raster think disregarding dlss considering gpu silly thing part high cost nvidia card considered dlss impressed hell changed amd nvidia dont regret
people value price performance vram card amd provides end come whether prefer nvidias feature
youre kind person constantly replaying single player ray tracing game id probably say yes went amd genuinely play none ray traced game 99 time im missing feature
really doesnt ray tracing nice gimmick worth performance hit played high refresh rate decade value much ray tracing
really doesnt
far cyberpunk path tracing framegen dlss balanced 1440p doesnt exceed 12gbs
12gb plenty 99 game
really 12gbs vram 1440p non issue
click link op provided
checked card price last 24 hour theyre either stock skyrocketing
depends region cheapest 7800xt 569e cheapest 4070 super 750e 32 expensive even upscaling nvidia horrible value croatia
also frame gen lot game cause wicked ghosting particularly aiming cursor well sharp contrasting object edge screen game fine others creates extra cursor aiming around really leaf much desired
used long
honestly nvidia worth alone driver solid driver never run issue troubleshoot amd gpu constantly weird problem tried forever keep card lol ended return got 4070 super never another problem maybe luck going nvidia ended much better thing lol ill gladly pay little youre honestly getting
damn
basically mini 4080 us die
honestly sometimes regurgitating obvious best thing someone hear basically put layman term know key difference
amd exploring rdna3 support fsr 4 doesnt mean come sorry pessimistic rdna3 launch waited year till promised feature advertised rdna3 came
ai accelerator rdna3 amd rdna3 giving ability speed matrix calculation running wmma instruction
im talking frame gen upscaler think ton people dont care completely detached reality
well talk upscaling majority people use feature reddit echo chamber
path tracing also go nvidia 7900xtx ray tracing performance fine press path tracing button frame rate get big sad
none 7900xt aroun 310fps pt 4k
path tracing another league 4090 card run maxed path tracing somewhat smoothly
completely agree considering raster day long gone everyone realise considering state many aaa title come youre either forced use upscaling live suboptimal fps case unplayable dlss4 simply way superior option fsr deliver available rtx gpus pretty big win eye
here story falling amd vram trap rdna3 launch one singular case used 16gb 7900xt heavily moded skyrim
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvdx4en2pzou rt dlss 1440p since 1440p card id say
8 hour testing different game setting benchmark overall fine pushing thing limit alan wake cyberpunk 4k ultra setting input lag frustrating random artifact distracting turned thing felt lot better input lag still noticeable
true asf
thats literally ai accelerator
yeah 4070s 1440p high pt dlss balanced get around 45fps 90 frame gen game look incredible
resolution
sure want max everything use raytracing path tracing need extremely high end card want play game high setting ray tracing 12 plenty video showed couple game get close 12gb anyways played game video 8gb vram card run fine
literally compute unit run bunch new instruction specialized hardware amd ai accelerator called matrix coreshttpsgpuopencomlearnamdlabnotesamdlabnotesmatrixcoresreadme find cdna gpus
4k
good know people acting like 16gb isnt enough 4k high refresh rate
reality tough dont play every aaa title played heavy one like alan wake ii cyberpunk stalker 2 wasnt case vram limited also amd nvidia vram usage slightly different ive heard compression word 16gb card isnt end world
upgraded 16gb card bit concerned long would viable 1070ti definitely hitting limit even 1080p game two non aaa game play really push system ram video ram 7 day die rust havent tried yet newer card itll interesting see much use 1440p maxed 8gb 1080p

desktop pc youll find prebuilt big name like dell hp lenovo acer others
agree 13 custom seems like lot maybe number excludes enterprisebusiness purchase
laptop sold desktop
ah yeah make sense 13 desktop home user even still seems high lot reasonable
ai overview according current market trend significantly people buy laptop desktop data showing laptop sale vastly outpace desktop sale meaning much larger portion computer market currently dominated laptop purchase
yeah still seems high maybe additionally theyre talking 13 sale home pc market might believable considering custom build cross 10k day

possible third world country

god lol thing insane idea sorry youd likely get freight forwarder u
like steam deck im really sure looking
youre lga 1150 platform tbh already way door 2015 youll need new mobo ram cpu least avoid intel cpu like plague upgrading fine good luck finding b580 advertised price people keep uncharging card theyre trouble keeping stock also upgrading gpu b580 without replacing old ddr3 era platform awful idea intel gpus worst cpu overhead three gpu maker one thing im 100 sure intel cpu motherboards didnt get rebar support 10th gen highly doubt rebar enabled 4th gen intel system without sort mod

additional 2x8 kit bought exact type first kit youre likely luck even exact kit sometimes hard get stable without lowering speed id recommend saving headache selling current ram buying 2x16 kit theyre pretty damn cheap day
make memtest86 boot drive test ram
opt return try switching around ram slot make sure place pair correct dual channel slot motherboard slot 1 3 2 4 may 1 2 3 4 instead check motherboard manual sure im running 4x8gb ram 2 different silicon power kit one sk hynix another samsung theyre working fine 3600 ryzen 5600 b450 sometimes get lucky work

exact kit lowered ram speed back default
yeah b450 doesnt memory support b550 qvl list hit miss sound like miss fwiw kit bought year apart even model number identical manufacturer change componentsspecs time dont change model number
still opt 2x16gb kit
yes
need ram
apart capable looking edit 4k future upraise ram
work likely slow
going cheaper part save 150 better gpu httpsaupcpartpickercomlist6tl3hw ssd sure replaced something know
get different cpu cooler everything else ok
dont believe cpu motherboard support drive ecc memory ecc mode even motherboard supported doesnt look intel kept serverworkstation desktop cpu platform pretty well separated ecc support consumer product amd way go
honestly many good monitor youll probably happy monitor choose would recommend find one price willing pay look third party review youre planning playing game watching occasional movie dont need anything crazy also go place like best buy microcenter youre near one monitor display use get feel like

ive never owned 4070 ti super 4090 7900 xtx since sold 4090 last month kept 7900 xtx mostly play game 4k native resolution without rt except game game force rt option turn observation gaming experience doesnt change much whether rt game like cyberpunk alan wake 2 horizon shine rt enabled though doesnt mean game bad without rtits personal taste also find dlss helpful bad people say especially since help reduce load gpu 10l sffpc formd t1 excessive heat enemy overall recommend 4070 ti super 7900 xtx reason mentioned upcoming aaa game likely force rt dlss useful upcoming 9070 expected significantly improve rt given situation better choose two option consider used 4080 super said cant go wrong either optioni love 7900 xtx served need well
owned sent back 7900xtx kept 4070 ti super fg game play xtx bad believe around 15 faster 4070 ti consume power care dlss rt important nvidia want raster vram go xtx
well multiplayer title shell similar experience card honestly major difference really going specific single player game like cyberpunk 4070ti super competent rt card dabble path tracing right combination dlss frame gen also access dlss 4 new transformer model proving make even performance level upscaling viable even saying practically match quality mode old cnn model feature make nvidia card enticing cyberpunk imo thats one game think cyberpunk gateway dive graphic intensiveheavy rt title could make stronger case card 7900xtx hand really powerhouse card term rasterized 1440p ultra gaming shed probably see 1020fps amd card depending game gap would likely grow enabled upscaling card generally speaking id say better 1440p card youre going heavy ray tracing notice quality drop using upscaling unfortunately still confirmed 7000 series card get access fsr 4 seems really closing gap fsr dlss eventually get could likely software based version similar xess nonintel card overall dont think youll go wrong either card case doubt girlfriend notice difference think shes really going fall love cyberpunk want best experience specific title 4070ti super probably better buy shes going play multiplayer game 90 time id lean toward 7900xtx
switched 4070ti rx 7900xtx id say xtx 15 better performance without using dlss fsr
atleast bought 7900 xtx think k worthy
4070 ti super day
1440p gamer fucking love 4070 ti super
4070ti super better raytracing thats 7900xtx simply much better situation unless really care rt much 1525 powerful game cant live without rt yeah go nvidia
xtx performance good model like nitromerctaichi new 5080 xd thing nvidia beat rt feature thats good two maybw three nvidia sponsored title rest suck ball even cyberpunk great everything always wet shimmer texture still awful quality shading complexity distance fall apart like bombed house 45
7900 xt amd equivalent 4070 ti 2 reason didnt go super card dont care rt skeptical 12vhpwr connector nbsp driver issue people amd either user error window messing around file nbsp window love trying overwrite driver oem crap unless disable option window driver timeouts time ive overclocked gpu much undervolted aggressively nbsp right running 3000 mhz core 2750 vram 5 power nbsp im rasterized game player play game like wow ff14 league legend
raw performance 7900xtx ray tracing 4070 ti
4070ti super upgraded dlss better rt go xtx cant stand two key feature
xtx 1000
price point cant get 5080
care rt better upscaling ai stuff nvidia sure even though slower raw performance vram way better rt ai stuff dlss upscaling way better
4070ti super powerful enough run anything isnt raytraced high enough fps raytracing better either way wont making mistake good card
went 7900xtx route nothing play focus rt mostly fps sim racing played single player game rt prominent id probably go nvidia far whether shed know difference see side side jump cyberpunk doesnt turn feature using amd card still going look good sure would look better shes got nothing compare shes got nothing upset
going exact situation right local computer store really good pricing 4070ti 7900xtx right next cost debating week post super helpful thanks putting post
position taking account minimal price difference id take 4070ti super went 7900xtx recently 200 cheaper 950 usd 1150usd far zero complaint though im happy choice
team 7900 xtx year old zero issue 2x 1440p 27144hz monitor besides ark ascended run everything may beyond fps bit noisy air cooled system 7950x3d phantom spirit 4 exhaust fan meh expected windy aio water cooled
definitely 4070ti super even competitive game there nvidia reflex soon nvidia reflex 2 make better card competitive gaming despite slightly slower also new dlss 4 resolution upscaling ridiculously good real world use case setting itll faster run way aggressive upscaling visual quality people already saying v dlss 38 already destroyed far performance mode previous quality mode yeah wash
youll like amd one day play game reason run poorly amd cardwhether due driver bad optimization something else friend nvidia card issue matter try wont able fix might lucky never experience could also unlucky experience ill never go amdits unpredictable new game underperform
1440p 16gb vram wont issue easy 4070 ti super dlss 4 great worth dont underrate dlss unlike someone else said dlss better rt performance big help cyberpunk also youre building someone else safer go nvidia less issue
dlss point 40 update insane essentially run 720p internal resolution look almost like native cyberpunk 1440p
would go 7900xtx everytime
xtx competes 4080 super xtx win pretty easily cant beat 20 faster avg httpswwwtechpowerupcomgpuspecsgeforcertx4070tisuperc4187
7900xtx dont look back
even competition 7900xtx easily buy gpus dlss fps
trust say 7900 xtx yes read whole post also dont overrate dlss fsr please
thing 4070tis might going xtx ray tracing performance critical factor weigh accordingly making decision though xtx easily powerful gpu cheaper according number choosing two given price list xtx would easy choice

markoni tommykay lol fan watching tommy last 5 year still youtube nonsub game fps futureproofing thanks large vram definetly 7900xtx want render something use gpu video editing cpu 4070ti super good luck video really liked hyped youtube viewer flame tommy comment funny would love something like maybe try flatter tommy
also plan playing cyberpunk 2077 ive seen enough get 4070 ti super gon na recommend 7900 xtx imo pure rasterized performance always priority cyberpunk 2077 title raytracing would pretty dumb get amd card try raytracing since nvidia mile better
raw performance major concern junky stability ray tracing frame gen low power consumption every thing better nvidia take 10 15 less performance buy one largest tech company world way eliminate second thought potential issue nobody would sad 3 year later card giving 50 fps raw xtx giving 60
played cyberpunk 2077 rtx 2060 still ton fun unless power consumptionefficiency concern europe wherever go 7900 xtx got much raw performance game probably even need fsr upscaling crutch next 5 year 7900 xtx still capable ray tracing still probably wouldnt dip 60 fps game extra vram 7900 xtx also big safety net future 4070 ti super doesnt
answered want wait month try get 5080 cant 4070tis
xtx 1440 resolution 4080 u ever want go 4k 4070 want regret frame gen pussy dont need alll setting ultra xtx vram cary
4070ti super happy
hi game 4k 144hz 6800 non xt mostly play 2k25 dota 2 beast mp title raw raster radeon beast fg readily available lossless scaling steam application dont like low vram affect visual fidelity performance higher resolution like 4k lossless scaling absolute magic especially title like bg3 100 fps steady act3 scaling 1440p 4k
wait 2 week fr rtx5000 series gpus come buy accordingly budget 5070ti way go 2 week
getting slated yes 5070ti simalar price going samesimalar speed better frame generation etc id certainly wait see real game benchmark chose
5070
card like xtx wont need dlss simple especially 1440p screen rt important card similar price go nvidia especially important cyberpunk since us ton rt honestly turn run fine xtx look benchmark game important xtx run cyberpunk fine dont expect performance rt setting 4070 ti super
7900xtx goated mp game
7900xtx faster lag behind ray tracing want good rt go 4070 ti
xtx day
7900xtx youre goin pro content creation
4070 ti super day
multiplayercompetetive game way better optimized thise single player game enough fps mutliplayer 4070 ti su wont nearly good experience singleplayer raytracing framegenration needed
7900xtx straight better card cheaper go 7900xtx dont look back
take 4070ti super got good
seriously dont understand people adamant 4070 ti super best choice 7900 xtx perform better every scenario significant margin outside want raytracing maybe personally finding raytracing extremely overrated contributes 7900 xtx outperform 4070 everywhere else additionally whole dlss fg argument bit wacky even cyber punk ultra run solid 120150 fps 7900 xtx without rt like youre forced use fsr often
short answer u want stream rendering 3d graphic video go rtx juast gaming go amd
7900xtx
7900 xtx guy cmon ti sper would nice virtual memory honestly power color got nice one w 24 gb u coin wait tomorrow new 5090 5080 1000 sound nice
went rtx 3090 7900 xtx didnt look back safely say wasnt regrettable move nothing issue 3090 one issue 7900 strong card yes rt isnt good nvidia however barely game need use kind dlss never needed since card performance great raw well im also running amd cpu
4070ti super 7600x cyberpunk beautiful mostly play cod warzone though
xtx done easy choice outperformingpacing nvidias brand new 5080 application
say get 4070ti super especially cyberpunk 2077 dlss 4 game look amazing also reflex 2 coming multiplayer title coming month amazing even dlss performance mode look really good cyberpunk title support 31 dlss version tested 4080 laptop 1440p absolutely amazing lol
generation make happy 7900xtx got cyber monday 2023 800 still raster performance similar 5080 vram good another couple year regarding frame gen need enough going 100 generated frame 120 generated frame significant difference matter low end maybe going 40fps smooth 60fps card give better raster may stronger considering demanding low frame rate scenario
7900 xtx month plus sent back got used 4070 ti super yes wont beat 7900 xtx raster dlss4 like deepseek ai totally disruptive amazing 4070 ti super running cp2077 3440x1440 dlss balanced fg full path tracing beyond crazy visual improvement close 100 fps compared 4090 prior latest update temporarily build 2 week returned 7900 xtx wanted try amd build 9800x3d glad back team green gpu side used 6950 xt playing prior 7900 xtx well amd done good thing adrenalin app actual graphic driver still behind nvidia even tried mod get better fsr fg going cp2077 even dlss35 comparable much less v dlss4 transformer model 7900 xtx isnt totally bad ray tracing bit behind 4070 ti super cant rely good upscaling really needed heavy ray tracing full path tracing also note amd card typically use 23gb vram top end v comparable nvidia card game setting 7900 xtx v 4090 24gb vram
amd lover would say probably go nvidia raytracing really nice relatively future proof
op make good point imo dlss im also pretty optimistic next couple year trust say used 4070 ti super youre going feel itch upgrade ur vram commenters agree 7900xtx superior pick believe xtx beat 4070tis despite nvidia technology behind said card pretty good though 7900xtx bigger beast gpu wouldnt blame op still sided 4070tis tldr id say u wait till u find killer deal either one card go
look comment see many people recommends xtx without explanation many recommends rtx real explanation
xtx day every day
wait 5070 ti 4080 used bad time buy gpu day new one used market change coming week
get nvidia card listed first anything 1440p
4070ti super better card
send back
could gotten lossless scaling kept 7900xtx
couldve downloaded lossless scaling frame gen every game xtx
thanks lot post super helpful totally agree mp game card really good issue come really start thinking cyberpunk 2077 game like gta future etc like think ray tracing noticed make like woooow playing doesnt even know ray tracing make experience lot better im insanely torn would 7900xtx like ray tracing also people always say dlss overrated really disagree honestly especially new dlss 40 stuff feel like scale card make work better longer doubt 16gb vram issue 5 year right anyways man amazing comment awesome thank taking time write goat
well thats point post know someone doesnt know ray tracing notice lot playing wowed experience
rt 4070 ti 1440p 144hz impossible
idea either want really good time wowed graphic thats hard choice personally would 7900xtx might rlly like ray tracing mind dlss
knowing go europe bad market especially expect 5080 far msrp like 1400 eur 900
he paying euro depending supply might pay 5080
yay problem man glad hear helped stuck quite bit legitimately tough question people commenting really helpful think wont make mistake either card tbh
true spitting fact honestly
ya dlss 40 look insane
quality frame rate dlssdlaa provides fsr garbage native taa implementation poor also like low input lag oh there reflex many game antilag 2 rt becoming ever common well ti super win keep dismissing invaluable feature though
answer trust dont elaborate say 7900 xtx besides saying nvidia overrated 6 taco earlier nicest taco bell ive ever would trust fart right
take account stability hassle free experience shes gamer primarily doesnt care pc stuff like want high end experience hassle free
ray tracing worth person never really really high end top line pc wont dlss matter possible lack vram next 5 year
hahhaha yes thats thanks lot man year og love bro youtube bois twitch monkey pc gf actually frontend web development dont think gpu matter line work want really good time stable experience hassle free would first time high end machine want like wooooow thanks lot support year man helping best man love brother
well idea go amd dont raytracing question raytracing noticeable would make like wooow playing untrained eye cool raytracing
really think game need like 20gb vram 1440p 5 year yeah really think dlss insanely good especially 40
op comment also 7900 xtx replaced 3080 past sold bought 4070 ti super like 7900 year didnt many issue one day couldnt stop driver update matter version except year old driver would cause constant driver crash game personally play wow ff14 path exile 2 random arpgs etc get raw fps case compared 4070 ti yes however say sucker ray tracing minecraft rtx water wet dream lol pretty ran issue vram would fix dont think ive ever really got above10 12gb usage game 5120x1440p a240hz monitor life gave ive tried dlss notice difference resolution monitor size 49 wont say sleep fsr amd good well polished dlss frame gen generation 50 series amazing wont person say fake fps isnt fps yet long quality latency acceptable society moving ai power many thing help continue expanding power consumption happy answer anything said returned 4070 ti super im gon na get 5080 price basically lol
note power heat fan noise
mainly better upgrading cpu 9800x3d getting gpu xtx us power fg work natively msfs primary game xtx use afmf2 make bunch change thing use outside msfs fantastic complaint honest id lying said tempted get another xtx anyway probably wontbut yeahit pro
problem man thought asked good question deserved good answer haha knew people would say one card ultimately isnt helpful regard question whether rt make experience better think bit tough question fact game still great even without ray tracing sometimes doesnt even necessarily improve game case even make slightly worse introducing artifacting said rt work well really make difference wow factor cyberpunk definitely good example rt especially path tracing really improving whole vibe game know card could use path tracing even upscaling like 4070ti super id definitely use cyberpunk look gorgeous game also think youre right dlss definitely worth people give credit time think ultimately people upset developer seem using crutch instead optimizing game end day tech really kind amazing especially new transformer model able kick upscaling without major downgrade visuals definitely allow card last longer current gen amd card imo please one grab pitch fork lol coming someone using 6950xt way im mean nvidia fan boy ive seen first hand difference dlss fsr enough know never use fsr performance mode hand new dlss performance look pretty damn good youve got amd nvidia card similar performance one use aggressive upscaling cant well obvious one use last longer somewhat controversial opinion reddit
2 cent made decision 7900xtx 4070 ti super month ago alongside 4k monitor ended upgrading rx 6800 rtx 4070 ti super main reason game like cp2077 ray tracing 4k benchmark 7900xtx really struggled rt ended going green prior always red gpu user never played 4k never played rt yeah made go woow im looking rt turn whatever play make game look much alive correct glass water effect shadow reflection everything 4k ultra setting dlss quality rt ultra pathtracing even without frame generation mostly got 5060 fps cyberpunk framegen 60fps stable finished tlou part 1 4k ultra native 5060 fps stable regret end decision
dlss4 made world difference cyberpunk actual playable ray tracing also vr skyrim mad god overhaul pbr lighting dlss4 made everything smooth butter weird moving line litteraly feel like real life insane
also people always say dlss overrated id bet never even tried dlss owned 7900 xtx 4080super tho experience 1440p resolution time difference huge im even talking dlss 4 yet fsr something id enable must dlss quality preset usually nobrainer dldsr dlss combined also pretty great stuff considering fsr 40 may really rx 9000 exclusive yea id rather take 4070 ti super even like 18 slower average rasterization also hdr capable monitor rtx hdr killer feature
one thing dlss feature like rt take vram overtime new dlss4 help capable model previous dlss fsr 4070 hardware specific stuff 50 series isnt getting feature framegen etc would say depends many raytraced title would play 5 year v title normally graphically memory intense cyberpunk title far really set apart
dont really play game rtx gf want full experience 4070 ti super would better choice dlss year ahead fsr anything else amd offer
httpswwwredditcomrbuildapcsipn75cqvie post give little answer 4070 ti super v 7900 xtx power
show video rt action like see want use tech go 4070 ti want fps possible 7900 xtx
struggle less amd turning playing 27 fps knowing wtf going asking build slow pc lol amd knowledgeable trouble shoot set game setting appropriately might annoying person new pc gaming
4070 super 90fps path tracing cyberpunk 1440p ray tracing 120 fps 4070ti super could 140
really depends game run
setting set
hardware unboxed made great video ray tracing ray tracing performance might help decide httpsyoutubedbnh0nyn8k8si1peskkbsieeeewmr personally value frame ray tracing
5070 ti
problem coming 2 day euro 1150 mean least try luck getting one cant evaluate option
amd doesnt need enable 3 feature win competitor gpu like nvidia keep swallowing jensen lie sure buy 5090 buy save game already hitting 12gb vram usage 3 year 4070ti wouldnt able start game native 7900xtx problem 6 year like low input lag also dont enable dlssfsr
7900xtx better 4080super game earth would even debate 7900xtx hand better card aspect besides ray tracing comparing 4070ti super honestly even care ray tracing right anyway
mean 7900xtx straight better card reasoning ill towards nvidia 5080 super 24gb vram come ill probably get thing 4070tis offer 7900xtx cant better rt even 4070tis take significant performance dip rt like 7900xtx raw performance really even close 7900xtx 1525 better situation
literally short suggestion want proof look benchmark 7900 xtx higher tier card competes regularly beat 4080 super next please reference exact part said nvidia overrated dont shit pant dude literally
ive got 7800xt slightly different card yeah way driver crash playing different game compared old 1060 different card nice spending less still running ultra 1440 isnt pc want game nvidia would probably worthwhile
nvidia rock solid practically never issue amd reliability high continues increase still quite par nvidia dont mind spending extra money nvidia worth
love 7900xtx much better value opinioni bought oc version sale even better model much cheaper basic 4080 brainer want hassle free plug play experience definitely go nvidia pay nvidia tax speak plug play dlss rt thing get thati dont care hold real value probably amd quirk learn avoid 90 driverstability issue xtx least phantom oc nice headroom overclocking undervoltinggot mine stable 1120mv probably go even lower got really usefull oc gave almost 20fps boost 4k tv got close 120hz refresh rate got rid frame dip need tinkering experimenting get card like opposite plug play tldr use case get nvidia would wait little try buy used possible thats another worm
dude care stability hassle free experience go nvidia hand even question amd need debug issue
already brake sometimes usually plug play install driver correctly misconception today nvidia work perfectly amd break fast look generall driver issue even security problem nvidia like last 2 year
single player game fps shooter game one spend time
ultimately say ray tracing absolutely worth dont forget lot game forcing eventually dlss also light year ahead fsr someone who owned 7900 xtx 4080 4080 far superior cant imagine 4070 ti super far behind
ray traceing joke never worth performance cost drop ray traceimg switch tech worth thinking xtx vram raster perfomance great
question raytracing noticeable would make like wooow playing experience ray tracing look great case look closely see difference varies game gamesome title look stunning ray tracing others impact barely noticeable also performance hit using raytracing huge like game ill get 144 fps soon turn raytracing itll tank 7080 untrained eye cool raytracing brutally honest though 95 time wont notice much might say look slightly better see difference end day subjectivebest solution show gf comparison youtube let decide
past couple year vram hysteric cry vram enough absolutely issue 12gbs 1440p running ptfg game game indiana went ultra high texture 0 iq difference time limited 16gbs 1440p gpu painfully slow anyways forget made non issue bullshit
ah stability issued amd side thats im worried cause gamer primarily pc enthusiast want high end experience hassle free game feel like ray tracing might wow impress even right long term also feel like dlss keep card year im torn doesnt know want im sure would better experience better 5 year gpu
yep 7900 xtx crashing wow real confirm find sollution turning advance graphic something like turned graphical option made wow look way better kinda unacceptable flagship model search reddit wow 7900 xtx crashing problem never got fixed either
even though main 6950xt right ive used dlss ton nvidia build ive seen difference fsr ill use quality upscaling absolutely must even ill opt xess instead available even dlss 2 3 quality mode felt like free fps 95 time pretty much reason use dlss 4 imagine people nvidia card probably kick upscaling automatically every title know would
3rd generation rt core along 3rd gen dlss would better game cyberpunk 2077
exactly want hassle free stable maybe im biased feel like nvidia better would amd gamer pc enthusiast
yeah sure
name one example
watched one yeah thanks
huh thats cheaper expected price similar cheapest 4080
oh really amd gpu competes 4090 5090 5080 right nothing barely even 4080 super competitor xtx amd isnt ahead slightly lower price one would buy otherwise still barely nvidia feature huge benefit amd trying hardest compete simply cant talking ti super 16gb 12gb upscaling also lower input lag doesnt increase youre thinking frame gen least clue youre talking start spouting nonsense
never heard upscaling
agreed went nitro 7900xtx strix 4080 super raw fps wise 1440p cod xtx kill think didnt like xtx high idle power never got fixed
remember there still bad bias amd card ive brand think great literal fact 7900xtx better 4070tis unless include rt
24gb 5080 super rumor likely happen
dont overrate dlss fsr please clearly directed nvidias dlss software seeing 100 suggesting 7900xtx get tho whole pure raster v frame gen saying elaborate little answer someone question start trust dont use word literally incorrectly abuse english language
guy went 7900xtx 4080 super id choose 4080 super 1010 time actually consider upgrade sure 7900xtx gave better frame cod bo6mw3 4080 super give id need anyways man rt dlss fg feature something cant believe missed dlss 4 going even better especially considering cant even use fsr4 7900xtx use dlss 4 new fg update 40 series brainer 7900xtx stuck last gen amd tech 40 series improving already better way id choose 7900xtx 4080 super id get 150200 cheaper indiana jones catalyst really changed mind fg also started getting vr difference performance cyberpunk 2077 7900xtx v 4080 super significant
exact opposite experience nowadays im linux go amd anyway since nvidia driver hassle generally also perform worse window counterpart even back window issue nvidia term driver update breaking thing gtx 980 broke due driver switched gtx 1070 later rx 6750xt amd 7900gre released germany didnt notice sort issue amd also consider amd adrenalin software way potent beginner friendly nvidias broken mess nvidia app window xp control panel nvidia worth extra money really onto cuda local ai stuff raytracing still isnt worth dlss optional red button amd still advantage fsr term delivering newer technology onto older card nvidia doesnt youre stuck current dlss version generation
fake news
yeah amd gpu spent least 30 hour trying fix wasnt fixable legit driver issue xfx support tech even gave contacted support im system admin work said issue wasnt card defective many driver version continue problem like recommended old stable one lose performance stabler want less issue personally id go nvidia driver lot stable less cruddy amd friend gamers dont dont wan na mess stuff return amd gpu people recommended addition dlss thing like almost like slight price increase likely better user experience isnt price per performance convo stability user friendly thing many people included even though tinker doesnt mean want time
raytracing might good reason go nvidea however ive xtx almost year whole amd drive issue far see long past ive zero issue personally run like charm
yeah people parrot amd gpus there reason nvidia vicegrip premium gpu market amd improves stability wise never catch nvidia wont reason lower price want amd intel better nvidia actual competition price go two cant compete premium top range card dont get wrong youre pc enthusiast comfortable regularly working amd kink save money instead spend time maintaining people want something regularly plug play machine nvidia stay top
5070 right around corner
yup single nvidia problem lol
buy amd shell dependent forever job security lol
yeah sure
minecraft
id rather sound like youre getting mad hostile cheerio mate
amd fan like cultist zealot never experienced group people completely touch mislead generally cluless super weird especially tech community
nvidia boner charging 1000 16 gb
yeah yeah 5080 problem 4080 see cant remember zotac someone else one aibs straight leaked card 24gb vram accident
correct use literally
people downplaying good dlss dlaa rt people huffing copium happy amd purchase wan na turn bell whistle modern day game need nvidia card unfortunate right
mean experience 11 9 year old nvidia gpus kind irrelevant today nvidia today like 78 gpu market steam user average person far less likely run issue nvidia driver given far gamers nvidia card devs know even theyre specifically developing nvidia card mind there thatll report bug glitch affect driver compared amd user also bringing linux make sense context op asking whats better card girlfriend who selfadmittedly gamer doesnt care pc stuff hassle free experience like lot linux offer come debugging random issue like quintessential linux experience definitely people arent tech savvy dont love tech dont want deal
ive built 60 pc people last year amd driver issue generally easily google well
okay still issue even 2025 man like yeah really dont want deal
hahahaha fair
minecraft run pice lemon stuck needle slice potato
dont get defencive literally write directly like wasnt intended sound rude anything like video card talk compared others emotional topic im generally curious
source trust bro
literally
well 2024 yeah lol really wish didnt issue really love 5700x3d cpu great rn gpus good amazing pricedollar pricedollar
ive amd 6900xt 7900xtx literally never issue people instability issue default system error message say driver timeout mean driver issue general fault saying something wrong could literally anything theyre right fsr need work ive literally amd card almost 5yrs zero problem outside personally overclocking messing thing people overblown driver issue
plenty amd user dont run nvidia card weird issue got friend prove often even fault window mess especially lately less stellar monthly update advice whatever card end choosing get clean install disable feature update security one long possible system stable need help window stuff recommend checking winutil plenty tutorial youtube
3 rig 3 amd gpus 5700 xt 6800 7900 xt theyre running fine ymmv cant confirm issue dont
deal gpu major issue nvidias driver past mostly game crashing due bad driver update needing make clean install even get temporarily banned online part game nvidia game ready driver issue making frequently crash counting time tech support friend pc nvidia amd bad driver may happen driver work well game dont sometimes shit happen install need ddu finally sometimes issue chair keyboard often ddu done gpu swap
take grain salt ive driver stability issue 6750xt still 2060 amd isnt really worse better nvidia according video ive watched topic pick whatever card best fit use case figure rest later driver stability thing really kind random chance thing youre right 7900xtxs vram likely isnt going really serve well since assume gf isnt machine learning lol 4070ti probably best option performance visuals
reverting driver take time nvidea issue know owned nvidia whole life currently also amd rig shit friend month old driver 4090 newer one give stutter xtx price brainer would take 4080
seems people might still hung something isnt issue anymore bought new system 7900xtx also read driver issue looking felt comfortable wasnt issue anymore previously stated regretted personally zero issue
honest reddit echo chamber youll pretty much get negative story completely fair driver failure rate extremely low company built othersowned many system sample size around 30 gpu nvidia radeon card except driver update halfed gtx970 performance monster hunter world rollback never encountered driver issue like horror story read time people dont really know even think 7900xtx equivalent 4080s personally one asrock phantom best friend one gigabyte gaming oc pretty happy issue free brother 7900gre recent build 7800xt nothing bad report end either almost year point
ive never driver issue past 4 card amd
ive 7900xtx month zero driver issue wouldnt say 2025 problem yet
answering q
look lmfao think 5080 sell good 8 better 4080 super ive got bad news lil bro literally 4080
6 taco earlier nicest taco bell ive ever would trust fart right dont shit pant dude literally look like fair use
unfortunately think experience vary lot amd ive running 7900xtx year bit think 4 maybe 5 time ive booted find something driver bugged big deal maybe 10 min uninstall ddu clean reinstall still pretty annoying ops gf isnt troubleshooter might worth potential hassle th minimal gain theyll get xtx
nope instability issue easy generalise wow issue well documented real amd even acknowledged released fix worked nobody crashing game even oc wow constant crash fix turning advanced graphical setting turned aa setting stuff made game look worse
fsr 4 looking insanely good theyd make work rdna3 amd doesnt market share pulling nvidia paywalling feature behind new generation product
personally problem doesnt mean issue overblown build pc business amd card cause lot problem
ive always heard youre gon na get amd gpu get amd cpu well avoid alot issue
thats also really fair point people comment complain likely issue rare exception
sorry hear man ive issue maybe prevalent different hardware configuration
entirely true one rig run 11900k rx 6800 fine
yeah know dont anything unusual though ryzen 7600x mainstream mobo could random piece software like said huge problem enough really annoying someone minimal troubleshooting experience

thank gpu would suggest cpu
ive started looking buildng pc week ago still learning load stuff like paring gpus cpu ill take look thank
best buy remainder budget
clarify installation iso cost nothing license key cost money need key addition installer dvdusb
would think could burn httpswwwelevenforumcomtdownloadofficialwindows11isofilefrommicrosoft1009httpswwwelevenforumcomtdownloadofficialwindows11isofilefrommicrosoft1009
yes window come optical medium
download official install m throw usb flash drive quicker install dont exact number hand remember dvd read speed close usb 20 speed modern usb speed multiple time higher neat novelty wouldnt recommend getting besides reason
usb version box copy sale well
well 119 dollar would hope come key
good choice still wont get full performance new gpus probably close enough well know benchmark come
yup make sense
theyre fine mobos case mostly personal preference
asrock b650 steel legend wifi fractal torrent youll happy person trust
thats probably fastest car get 400 buck new 6800 xt get 80 fps 1440p mix high ultra
definetely look used market buy trusted seller cant go wrong amd gpu likely wont die faster
rx6800 solid gpu 400 would give solid bump performance wait new gpus would need spending 5600 5070 9070 series unless want wait even longer 50609060 also got ta hope find new gpu stock may hard able spend 100 7800xt would excellent gpu
4090 way cheap 5090 30 less performance save lot money
upgrade 6800 great youll definitely notice itll last year newer game start putting lot stress considering already decent time thats expected honestly kind perfect setup readjust play game enjoy playing ps5 start playing graphically intense game since theyre optimized leave pc easy run game shooter like c r6 play keep steam deck whatever want thats suggestion tho actual upgrade like said 6800 great want wait find good price 7800 xt somewhere range itll last longer
probably buy trump gon na tariff taiwan thats chip get made price go im guessing
oh nice think 6800 hold id love upgrade another 23 year
fastest car probably clapped ford crown victoria cop car
ah word ive never gone used gpus tip finding solid seller
well 1440p 60fps quite 4 year old card tho get 7800xt used 400 would last 3 year easy 4070s used option
cant buy car 400 anymore thats like nice nice bicycle kind budget
lot good review definetely worth also try meet person scammer accept money never send package
lol youre right time
try uninstalling driver use ddu restart reinstall driver test think sound like need contact gigabyte assistance
already 980 pro ssd prior build youre buying new two ssds monitor poor choice speed rest system 5090 gpu really want 4k monitor mostly gaming 9800x3d faster rest look good
hi 2 ssd one entirely system document one game etc also thanks recommending monitor cpu
dont need two physically separate ssds simply create separate partition main drive
oh didnt knew thanks
getting 5700x3d would easier cheaper
would get 5700x3d hold till am6
everything great wait future future proof
5700x3d definitely way go find make sure good cooler oh dont worry pcie bandwitch gamers nexus test 5090 causing loss of1 fpshttpsyoutubel1npffrtzlosilsaqvvoh1maczves
5700x3d drop upgrade bios update need enough performance run anything market competently going am5 build worth option available save money next future upgrade
youre happy performance im much camp keeping hardware longer happy performance game want play
9900k old irrelevant 125 7500f way faster
9900k worth upgrade gpu see i5 cant keep youll go current gen processor
get 9900k maybe 40 free sure go new system
working recently symptom sound like bricked bios recognized hardware level software communication happening
motherboard window version similar problem 5700xt mobo old bios needed flashed uefi one also converted window 10 install mbr gpt bios ensured booting uefi also needed change pegx setting auto 1 got gpu work reference gigabyte gaz68apd3 rev 2
bought used microcenter physically look brand new plugged first time build dont computer around test card problem something else also mention bios would toggling bios switch card anything
z390 ud also fairly old cant check exact o version rn knowledge latest version 2021 10 ltsc support
sure possibly dont pc
tried nothing changed
part thinking without wed idea generally though get case based motherboard atx mobo mean atx case eatx mobo mean eatx case etc
12600k dont see gpu
thank pointing build two gpu gpu sapphire pulse rx6600 8gb two none ive edited post include gpu
least u rx6600 worth price difference two build
oooh helpful thank pointing ill make sure consider since price jump really feel slightly high recommended gpu worth buying 2nd hand
14700k update bios undervolt 7800x3d bundle 50 want upgradeable platform faster gaming cpu
7700x bundle 400
12900 even supposed fix would never trust 13th 14th gen intel chip
14700
yeah unless there specific software op use requires intel gaming rig 7800x3d like pick also really dont trust 13 14 even issue mitigatedresolved
undervolt
agreed save money could put something else would also strongly suggest getting ultra wide monitor instead dual monitor recently made change aesthetically functionally much better
14900kf bios update undervolting 0 issue literally 0 since thing 9 month ago
problem thing mostly productivity gaming
people still getting degrading 13th 14th gen i7 i9 cpu running 253w even theyre brand new rmad need undervolted rapidly degrade
id take 9700x bundle 30 bit faster newer draw less power save money
there still guarantee degradation issue solved never way find use wait prefer take gamble longevity pc part
believe thats undervolt fine undervolt look like stock setting still degrades dont
productivity task
degrading sorry question im bit fo newbie
curiosity rapid rapid decay
problem resolved bios update need undervolting
go bios make couple change sure problem still get 6 ghz speed
lot coding 3d modeling game dev maybe planning starting tech yt channel
wasnt people still getting degraded chip new cpu
7800x3d fine likely wont notice difference two people overestimate cpu need also using gpu 3d modeling
compare 14700k 7800x3d task see big enough difference go 14700k chart next page use list bottom jump need httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewintelcorei714700k7htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewintelcorei714700k7html
people link credential experienced zero problem since bios update friend everyone talk online including tech reviewer
yeah id like source beyond trust bro ive keeping ear tuned subject heard nothing new wasnt article repeating happened month ago someone buying used cpu discovering borked
gpu would recommend
thanks
pirate software team biggest example source trust brother source since pc shop tested degraded cpu brand new cpu brand new cpu undervolt 0x12b stress testing undervolted one fine 2 becoming unstable ofc small sample size time tell degrade id rather take afternoon undervolt
httpswwwredditcomrbuildapcswcwl0darq5 comment ive seen reddit post recently couldve normal rate failure id rather undervolt safer
depends entirely budget
listed budget would say around 1700 pc thinking 7900xt
although id usually recommend amd solely gaming nvidia may better option depending program youre using 3d model 3d modeling software benefit lot cuda dont
blender use
id consider getting 4070 ti super 5070 ti youre anything super complex 7900 xt still good
ok thanks help
four stick ddr5 unlikely run fast two stick without making adjustment raising voltage slowing speed loosening timing combination day recommended go four stick thats way get capacity need want buy four stick set come xmpexpo profile specifically four stick ideally one qvl motherboard return stick bought buy 2x32 set would better way get 64gb though little expensive fyi 6000 cl30 good hynix ram chip thats probably want ryzen dont mind experimenting could try running four stick 5600 5200 see got stable definitely use good memory test least couple hour like karhu occt ycruncher prime 95 tm5 see appear stable may want run slower speed wouldnt even stable
cpu using trouble 4 stick ddr5
xmpexpo stability box 4 stick ram iffy without manual tuning youre willing tune best bet would get 2 stick 32gb instead
try running new without old youll know whether actually bad ram likely motherboardcpu combination cant handle 4 stick 3000mhz
exact brand speed box id assume work tried using new stick v trying old stick obviously tried old new stick together new stick dont work thats answer id also turn xmp expo stuff work try turning back ram considered overclocked especially 6000 higher id assume there something wrong return try ordering new one forget entirely play everything 4k maxed never get remotely close using 32gb ram 4 stick isnt recommended amd
sound good appreciate insight
updated thread system spec gifemotefreeemotespackslightlysmiling
id willing tune knew thats case guess ill pick 2x32s
sound good im going run old set tomorrow see run issue swap new one verify stick bad entirely could cpumobo combo cant handle 4x stick usually research pc upgrade best saw good sale next day delivery said eh
havent tried using new stick ive told online apparently cpu doesnt like 4 stick ddr5 thats easy solve
yeah really shouldnt trying run 4 stick ram cpu
fairly involved know wouldnt really want lol moderately tedious process
yup look case digging apparently 7800 hate 4 stick ill go get 2x32s call day
ah think ill grab 2x32s shouldve done research slap ram newer system old ddr4 rig ran fine 4x4s lol low frequency
put part pcpartpickercom set canada take look
power cut around 50 done rip
motherboards new return window still open return otherwise go rma
shouldve backed first bios bmc flashereg flashback qflashplus revive maybe dual bios board need external flashing potentially even circuitso desoldering requires patching binary unless backupbecause bios update file arent direct rom image moral back bios
damn think sign get ups
yup done
nahh system 5 year old
would backing solve died midflash bios update file arent direct rom image umthey entire rom image though patch previous version
rip thank god macbook would fucked
rom backup restore external flasher firmware update file complete rom get backup dump procedure carrying certain patch configurationsand purging certain configuration serial number mac address carried update program bios updating tool even bmc flasher simple sending cap manufacturer site chip compared reflashing dump amount perpetual state carried image create complete image manufacturer binary alone vendor flashing tool quite good job backup complete rom let retry official way
thats good explanation didnt think boardspecific information thanks
rsffpc would prob helpful
posted well
size fan
theyre 120mm
best cpu could put pc 5700x3d thats budget
plan upgrading graphic card cpu first
5700x3d new graphic card maybe 32gb ram would really nice upgrade
im new computer upgrade ram
really easy probably easiest upgrade pc ram held two clip simply push pull old stick put new stick watch youtube video detail
thanks
ddr4 3600mhz ok
perfect ideally cl18
need new cpu cooler sorry dumb question lol im learning
depends currently stock amd cooler id recommend something like thermalright phantom spirit 120
also kind graphic card 3090
thats probably right choice whats budget graphic card
300600
maybe radeon rx 7800xt
looking rtx 4070 ti super think called
also good find one stock msrp
4080 still expensive lol downgrade bit
concern 4070 ti super production month supply drying push price higher
oh ok search number higher 3070 correct higher number better
exactly example 3080 faster 4060 look benchmark see true performance
3080 better 4070 super super
couldnt find 4070 super stock without 1k price asus dual radeontm rx 7800 xt oc edition 16gb gddr6 better 30703080
look benchmark game play
look benchmark
exactly google benchmark said game search bar
yes also include gpu youre interested
play world warcraft benchmark 4070 super decent awful price range
say go
also trouble finding 5700 x3d cpu

either fine wire run short enough matter getting custom cable better dont much extra cable jam case extension better cant accidentally order incorrect one fry component
lenovo r27qe really good price

get wd sn580 sn770 sn850 whichever cheapest theyre fast enough gaming theyre incredible value
alright thanks advice 40 x 4 would save buck plenty fast actually running teamgroup 30 x4 plenty fast reliable chose 990 highly recommended dont know thanks
oh thanks warning input would still recommend case overall could would use something else
one minor thing o11 basically dual chamber case theyre huge much larger people likely suspect theyre tall case massive footprint make sure space case size commit one
thanks taking time explain much currently looking 240300hz monitor currently sound like 5090 sure overkill cant say upset considering price tag attached definitely look storage drive go also psus kind seem looking kind chose one random reputable brand know pretty bad haha check quiet one sure
fyi comment isnt silly mate there almost reason go pcie 50 x2 theoretically provides amount bandwidth pcie 40 x4 fewer lane unless reason mobo another part need allocate bandwidth efficiently going cheaper option4 x4 better gaming literally couldnt matter less even going pcie 5 x4 waste money offer double amount bandwidth even though overkill could potentially worth investment 5 x2 waste money
look thanks
problem mate
would use anyway still good case
knew quite bit wider havent actually measured yet make sure measure space going dual chamber case luckily long desk dont think problem although run triple monitor still better sure earlier comment o11 vision definitely appealing worried airflow especially 50 series card vision side aio bottom three fan one exhaust seemed potentially problematic built vision noticed negative impact heat
990 evo plus currently less expensive several high end pcie 40 x4 ssds better performance first launched expensive 990 pro dumb perfectly valid option youre looking top performing ssd though said post dont actually recommend budget pcie 40 x4 ssds like sn770 suggested
ive built either case like look theyre way wide ever buy one using aio intake increase gpu temp v using aio exhaust 2c basically meaninglessly unless live hot location gpu always running thermal throttling big deal use aio intake said bottom intake fan o11 mostly aesthetic setup bottom intake side exhaust o11 vision gpu temp actually worse using aio intake single exhaust adding bottom fan intake aio intake mostly make case louder rather improving temp
look great head motherboard small chance needing bios update support ryzen 5000 say small built anytime soon box ready wasnt build recently may need update latest bios look like model flashback button though need older ryzen cpu update
budget system there nothing obvious wrong part selected minor tweak suggestion recommend motherboard id probably look spending little motherboard two m2 slot option adding storage future wo needing keep sata cable around asrock b450m pro4 example might decent option 89 also get 4 ram slot ram pretty safely go 16gb build class game even need generally using lot mod like skyrim minecraft otherwise lot user generated content vrchat 2x8gb 3200 cl16 need future easy enough buy another random 2x8gb 3200 cl16 similar kit get 32gb ryzen 5000 cpu work well 4 stick ram itll also help get back 600 upgraded motherboard ssd 1tb isnt lot day fill quickly modern game price point hard afford much motherboard least let upgrade little easier gpu 6650 xt decent enough gpu right rough time buying gpus used otherwise new midrange gpus due next month seems like used market going crazy combination people dumping higher end gpus cheap low end gpus insane price 180 pretty good amazing least absolutely insane one case psu job holding blowing air thing sending power nothing remarkable either price class thats probably good thing
thanks appreciate feedback
congrats quite upgrade performance
went 1080 merc 310 rx 7800 xtx fantastic merc 310 predecessor magnetic air iirc
dang thats nicelooking card also thats massive upgrade enjoy knowing game earth cant play smoothly
dont bother magnetic fan model dont provide performance benefit xfx provide replacement fan whatever reason ever break would save money buying xfx 7800 xt qick 319 model applying honeywell ptm7950 sell 4 aliexpress

thats decent plan 6700 xt midrange gpu 2021 expect itll good another 4 year considering gtx 1070 lasted till get good quality 650 watt psu go replace cpu motherboard youll also want 32gb ddr5 work well new cpu
great thank gpu issue im certain either way upgrading pc time whatever need priority come first uncertain part first purchased together answered thank

normal want gpu hitting close 100 often possible gaming youre streaming even reason want happening nvenc encoder taking already rendered frame frame buffer encode efficient format make easier stream hd quality without taking huge hit performance gpu take processing gpu die much negligible people used say lower gaming performance much 30 day youre likely even notice 5 reduction streaming nvenc encoder youre chasing solution problem doesnt actually exist
dont know much ob encoding cpu gpu
thanks lot reply hear clarify get around 150170 streaming close 300 streaming friend 4070 gpu still push fps exact setting inside ob still get around 2530 better performance normally want gpu use 70 90 gaming rest useful example streaming encoding totally wrong saying
gpu setting output encoder setting set nvidia nvenc

use 970 o game others well steam specify multiple drive install game without issue 4 nvme ssds 2 sata game installed
use nvme sata nvme o game large enough loading time thing old sata ssds thing performance difference unnoticeable
would use old drive also didnt would run 2 separate 2tb nvmes get single 4tb get additional performance ssd get internally parallelized larger something like raid 0 cost per gb go one less nvme slot use
windowsos doesnt need 1tb wouldnt use perfectly working ssd another use old ssd id fine 3tb
honestly would used 970 evo system drive backed 4tb nvme drive storage add another nvme later needed
dont buy new ssd unless 4tb keep using old one replace one 4tb 8tbs coming saw one 630 microcenter sale hit 300 im
keep mind nvme drive mtbf rating usually equates 5yrs higher end brand youre like 10yrs worth data writing 1yrbut samsung cool warranty replace upgrade use 4yr old nvme youre going able make use latest nvme tech may fail sooner want
make nice fast external drive nvme sell kit 10 buck
would use dont room pc fit another drive ill buy enclosure make external ssd
always 1 2tb drive delete game beat stop playing
use mix old ssdhdd still use date way back 08 09 include 640gb wd black till chugging along perfectly confirmed smart test relegated game storage mostly day game want play thrown onto ssd still use easy task
dont think im getting sata drive new pc though think im fine three m2 drive
damn dumb mistake buy new 2tb nvme wouldve gone single 4tb drive since storage want anyways cant return 2tb anymore im thinking using new 1tb window 2tb game old 1tb game medium whatever im wondering better way manage
rethink yes youre right already bought new 2tb nvme lol sure would best idea
wouldnt buy new sata ssd think there sense storage already accessible
odds old drive still better 90 life left use samsung magician check update firmware necessary use split steam gog humble bundle epic etc across 3
hindsight storage one thing generally reused new build
1gb nics would benefit performance unless current realtek nic issue
use gpu receiver earc monitor 541 atmos speaker setup hdmi signal digital also tried optical output motherboard sound card enough capacity support 71 able feed atmos signal
use optical cable pc receiver
correct
youre much better hdmi receiver

gaming advantage 48gb ram may even reduce overall system performance couple percent stick original plan sell old memory already buy new ram would possible get new ram faster already
mostly use gaming dont really run highly complex program think ill sell buy new ram already ddr4 3600mhz cl16
""
idk bought released 9 year ago would replace worth saving money
isnt one explode pretty old model regardless budget better modern 750w 850w look review site like hardware bustershttphwbusterscom would recommend getting one
bought 5 year ago
one better corsair cx750 bronze 80 euro quiet system power 10 750w bronze 80 euro seasonic b12 bc850 bronze 80 euro seasonic g12 gc750 psu gold 90 euro
think everything better currently four believe quiet one worst bunch 230 volt version model everything else pretty close seasonic unit maybe slightly better
okay thanks bought seasonic g12 gc750
command run exactly convert disk efi
mbr2gpt validate first came back fine used mbr2gpt convert thats error came
running command win10 o preboot environment advanced option
preboot environment advanced went trouble shooting get
ran issue certain command working properly issue ntfs file system fix would run chdsk command o drive boot verify file system corrupted also one drive connected also try running command win10 directly admin cmd prompt mbr2gpt convert allowfullos
go two drive one hold operating system c ssd drive give try admin cmd
since two drive need specify drive command well
like typing disk 0
look like info m websitehttpslearnmicrosoftcomenuswindowsdeploymentmbrtogpt dont specify disk system disk used would still run chdsk o drive verify file system good

source sure usbc youre plugging output video im using reverse adapterhttpswwwamazoncomdpb0by3vs8lf convert thunderbolt 4 usbc dock hdmi monitor work fine look like also usbcthunderbolt hdmi dongle end rather dock dongle cable monitor youre dock cable dongle monitor
dont see wouldnt feasible lot device connect usb c dock output hdmi even usb c hdmi cable usb c monitor
yes
work usbc dp display port charging usbc usbc cord
yes tried took mac book pro 2021 plugged new iphone usbc cable also tried long laptop usbc cable plug female end adapter plug hdmi male end adapter dell 32 inch 4k monitor 2022 work tried several computer different dell monitor well

questioning feasibility option available amazon zero available microcenter good see thing work ill post update tomorrow
got ta make sure usb c cable port pc support display output usb c altmode use thunderbolt 4 port thunderbolt cable otherwise get regular display cable plug display adaptor
need proper usbc cable capable transmitting sort data usbc cable dont support video high speed data
iirc iphone usbc cable usb 20 theyre going support thunderbolt dp long laptop usbc cable say exactly nothing need something like thishttpswwwamazoncomplugablethunderboltsupportscompatiblecertifieddpb07r43lpcx affiliation one fist hit amazon useful example look imho youre better dongle linked prior comment since hdmi cable standardizedeasier understand usbc cable
cable one came phone wont work one come iphones basically intended use charging cable implement power delivery usb 20 data pin iirc look inside male end see 6 pin side usb standard group absolutely dropped ball making sure easy tell usb cable capability
damn okay guess usbc 31 cable arent really shipping standard many product yet looked around house right even iphone pro cable cord mode a2795 usb 20
ill buy one report back
thats theyre meant much charging
sure bios update successful would try 1600x see post normally
make sure something plugged cpufan header motherboards dont boot without something plugged cpufan header usually caused plug aio positive am4 board require cpufan post one give cpu light dont think itd result orange cpu light monitor plugged gpu nonigpu cpu unsure tried cmos battery unplugged capacitor discharged remove cmos battery havent leave 10 second check ram resetting cmos time ive seen am4 ram issue really finnicky cmos especially asus board overly tightened cpu cause issue ive often heard described finger tight hand tight id unscrew cooler fully sound like plan testing old cpu anyways gen cpu safe post bios unscrewed cooler even without thermal paste recommend keeping rad aio top cpu question would whether 1600x still work id learn towards bios related doa cpu perhaps verify ram compatibility motherboard though work old cpu
99 sure guess im gon na change cpu see also im trying run pc without cpu issue beep code without cpu
1600x doesnt work anymore although forgot mention updated bios 1600x anything inside pc launched pc correclty window msi even gave amd chipset update driver window
cpu fan connected also removed cpu cooler still problem monitor connected normal gpu didnt remove whole battery yet put back old cpu pc doesnt work power button anything although old cpu literally sticked old cpu cooler maybe cause problem gon na try remove battery play ram tomorrow cause 1am thanks
alright plugging cpu fan didnt change anything monitor plugged normal gpu tried unplugging gpu change nothing remvoed cmos battery change nothing removed ram cleared cmos 1600x 5600x case ez debug cpu light first time 5600x anything else removed ram gave cpu ram led 1600x doesnt work anymore light ez debug cpu matter
pc never post without cpu ram make sense
ok unsticked cpu cooler pc start still problem ez debug led cpu white usb working

seems like great plan might also want consider 32gb ram
32 gb ram would help much
pcie30 totally fine youll probably lose 13fps less 1 however rtx5080 questionable choice seems worth price maybe wait bit longer dont rush initial release imo

trying mix ram jedec 3200 mt profile set xmp 3200 mt work automatically may able get 3200 mt manually specifying timing guarantee work would far better finding another set jedec 3200 mt ram
time learn manually overclock
sigh never mix ram let lesson future activate one xmp profile ram take setting issue profile might work well ram since speed need match also timing forcing ram run profile made cause issue like crash second mistake made mixing size ram work best dual channel mode run 8gb dual channel mode across 4 stick 2x8gb left 2x16gb running single mode lose performance activating one xmp profile set speed 3200 two stick try set everything manually hassle need stress test even run stable
need buy full matching set dont want run problem default edit incorrect
youre running four populated slot dualchannel memory board almost certainly limited default ddr speed ie xmp even matching set run higher speed using 4 slot likely run speed believe youll 2133mhz configuration 4 dimms
mismatched ram basically guaranteed never overclock together sometimes issue standard speed
yeah discovered seeing happened xmp said overclocking would get speed higher advertised packedge go idea try resell mor less paid get 3200 standart thanks help
would cool learn dont think time screw im totally fucked lol resell jjedec 32000
second mistake made mixing size ram work best dual channel mode run 8gb dual channel mode across 4 stick 2x8gb left 2x16gb running single mode lose performance incorrect 16gb 8gb dimm channel run everything dualchannel mixing size long done pair configuration channel perfectly ok activate one xmp profile ram take setting op one kit xmp ram lexar kit jedec 3200 mt xmp profile
xmp would problem obviously always better going single kit one information took attention researshing
absolute rubbish easy run four stick ddr4 xmp provided pay attention thing pretty much guaranteed work four identical singlerank stick work time dualrank stick singlerank stick per channel provided stick matching xmp profile
op one kit 3200 mt standard speed lexar jedec 3200 mt ram ops mistake buying set ram needed xmp 3200 mt
thats ram oc work set voltage rated voltage kit 125 135v cant remember say stick set speed target tweak timing machine crash undo 1 notch enjoy
complementing yeah dualchannel problem lexar xmp profile besides 4 working perfectly
right thanks correction

yes single fan header usually provide enough amp 5 typical case fan connect three splitter single header one fan provide tachometer signal back mb determine fan speed 3 fan speed managed one fan fine fan brand type pwm signal control speed
hey everyone wondering attach argb fan pwm artic fan hubhttpswwwarcticdeencasefanhubacfan00175a pwm fan splitter
diasy chain together need splitter gathered connect one fan mobo good enough
connector allow sure concept case thermaltake came 3 front fan already connected definitely using splitter cable also 3pin fan weird day age use dc voltage control versus pwm manage speed
thinking getting fan hub want fan future linking pretty sure fan daisy chainable 4 pin fan
problem older matx board guess planning people needing lot fan matx build using liquid cooler board single cpu fan single system fan header thats

285k great productivity cpu efficient 14900k
think thats thing 285k really good plus better connectivity storage option z890 older chipsets
youre going mostly productivity get 285k compute monster really good gaming youre planning gaming get 9950x
would try 9950x really want intel e would say 14900k buy new box get latest bios
thing thats like important used thing tho
thats figured based limited review wondering anyone 285k
game play arent demanding dota 2 cs2 believe anything better 3770 day
285k beat 9950x specific software otherwise would gone amd way afford going 14900k z790 loosing everything instability able find recent review
one friend work got one upgrading 5900x photo video editing love dont know exactly us far program though
285k zero problem running dota 2 cs2 also beat 9950x productivity would probably go
accordingly intel fixed problem rma extended 5 year look like already decided go 285k
yet actually getting z790 14900k cheapest option wondering rma would actually fix anything
itll keep safe youll receive money new processor intel lot thing normally honor contract used 13900k got money back get 9800x3d know said read intel 9 285k difference cinebench 20 point test youre sure dont want go amd
quiet intel instability wouldnt worry new build updated bios long thermal control probably require llc tuning running 14900ks since april 0 issue another pc house running 14700k also without issue build common vid vcore kept control thus good thermal day 1 also microcode bios update followed
thats good know actually sure chose two based youtube review blender premiere honestly cant make mind yet
cooler using bought arctic freezer iii 420 mm
worry intel lot cool tech help rendering problem 13 14 generation shame

depth review hardware canuck found dark rock pro 5 elite underperform am5httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvltndbgddlps specifically since didnt state purpose 9800x3d assume gaming motherboard overkill 64gb overkill unless need something gaming id get 6000cl30 6400cl32 still isnt guaranteed run am5 unless like ram tweaking performance benefit tiny even work especially x3d cpu psu seems badly priced 750w corsair e model also arent quietest low load reportedly
would definitely get higher watt psu go like 850 1000w future proofing spending much cou cooler could go aio roughly price also need case fan help cool everything well
oh didnt notice changed
good 1440p need 120fps max setting 4k fine youre ok turning stuff using fsr
similar issue recently built new pc got ryzen 7800x3d 7800xt struggling even get like 100 frame siege turn energy power plan set power saving mode lol idk set might case try changing back balanced see help

upgrade processor tell stay away 14th gen intel lot issue 14700k 14900k going bad son friend 14700k 14900k like 3rd rma run 13700k fine run board long pretty recent bios 12600k fine probably wouldnt need upgrade 17 year old 12600k computer 32 gb ram couple samsung nvme drive 4070 ti super corsair rm850x psu run anything fine new indiana jones game cyberpunk alan wake problem everything close max want upgrade board may want look amd am5 board one x3d processor am5 newer socket upgrade path future
yeah turned 13 got jacket grateful
helpful im trying avoid board upgrade put together last christmas almost broke mementally spiritually
imo fortnite cpu dominated game going 3060 5070ti would yield much result game far tell
know feeling built son birthday like 2 year ago 3060ti graphic card got 4070ti super christmas expensive might want check like 12700k 13700k something like upgraded 12500 13700k mine still noctua nhu12a cooler enough since dont overclock cooler 12600k liquid cooler maybe 12900k even 13900k make sure latest bios
youre five year late gpu crypto mining party
done
friend mostly gaming 1440p 1080p open amd gpus also dont necessarily need liquid cooler amd cpu since run relatively cool unless look
yeah gaming 1080p made small note post mentioning thank aio one really look regard gpus prefer nvidia ive already showed benchmark video theyre familiar nvidia would rather stay
case yeah 4060 plenty fine could step motherboard cpu save little unless specific feature needed either way solid build also could go slightly slower storage ssd going silicon power ud90 2tb assuming still sale
alright ill look little bit thank decided go 4070 super 2nd build due 12gb vram rather 8gb vram little budget work mobo cpu recomendations
get em live standard msi b650 board like 7600x amd cpu cheaper go 9600x basically price
much
better gpu buy new cpu later
id go 4070 probably people say new dlss model really nice 4070 much powerful b580 always upgrade cpu later need probably fine 1440p anyway
know little harder find mobos support rather impossible considering dont exist cpu motherboard ram need compatible one another use pcpartpickercomhttppcpartpickercom compatibility checking
ugh guess read carefully dumb ai said support said ai dumb let scroll first article mentioned motherboards support proposed future motherboards article 2022 thanks
think last time ever saw dualram motherboard switch sdr ddr first ddr even number mb 2 slot could use one gosh 2000 actually owned one board allowed migrate existing ram upgrade better ram later 25 year ago nothing like since

am4 much viable day 5700x3d one best cpu market gaming am4 would advisable upgrade am5 switch am5 would lot lot gain ryzen 5600 budget upgrade cpu budget would throw 5700x3d gpu choice point upgrade 32gb memory even budget 2k would still argue upgrade am5 wouldnt worth added cost
httpsukpcpartpickercomlist7qndxg better better cpu also pcie 40 support ssd gpu use full potential upgraded gpu better one pick want either rx 6650xt 7600 want pick choice price see performance difference benchmark youtube upgraded 32 gb recommended price difference big either also switched decent msi 650w 80 bronze psu recommended gpus switched ssd reliable one also faster mean little get lot better system dont confused 2 gpus put select

two ssds spend extra get single faster 990 evo plus 4tb less money otherwise look quite good im assuming microcenter near scoop 7600x3d
thanks reply sadly microcenter near lucky secure relatively cheap 7600x3d via ebay day ago agree ssd part samsung ssd leftover probably probably need 2 tb space future
oh got ya yeah good solid build regardless good luck getting 5080
thanks lot took away big part insecurity
basically decent size case futureproof case 14 year old still support latest hardware go whatever find look nicest
whichever find appealing
case since 2008 antec three hundred fancy gobble everything throw
youre looking future proof case spend bit get something like corsair 5000t thats lock future proof case thermaltake a500tg think paid around 250 far 5 year old seen 2 build ready another 5 420mm gpu length 168mm cooler tower clearance great still midtower space grey hard come

990 evo z690 ive happy large game gta v 400gb mod folder forza horizon 5 warzone etc pro wasnt worth price difference got there sale amazon 20 evo 2tb
sn850x
yeah might get one two 990 evo plus 1tbs co 2tb abt 100
bit expensive 990 evo plus
definitely recommend evo
go cheaper one youre tight budget big difference gaming
samsung generally better wd
hmm could get 4tb 990 evo plus 450 30 3 1tb drive id get extra tb 2 slot open perhaps would better
im gon na get 4tb
depends game generally speaking pixel need powered stronger gpu gpu game question game primarily cpu bound jump 1080p 1440p stress gpu cpu upgrading cpu could confer fps boost 1440p still get good idea look benchmark hardware
depends gpu type game
point upgrading since dont need upgrade get new monitor see need also pc part tend get cheaper time really reason upgrade
ive got 4070 atm
4070 really capable card game cpu bound upgrading likely increase fps even 1440p really depends game though
ah see thanks mean mostly play fortnite helldivers 2 story game 1080p monitored helldivers 2 noticed cpu bound guess upgrade i5 also one question think 550w psu would enough handle 4070 i5 12400f along lian li infinity fan around 56 strimer cable rgb 4070 tdp 200w i5 65w according google enough right need account anything else
enough would avoid overclocking isnt much headroom assuming system high load i5 draw around 120w max high load recommended psu wattage 4070 system 650w pushing 550w psu 80ish load degrade part time use quality psu something would prioritize bad psu damage part
ive got xpg pylon 550w ive heard quite decent im confused 4070 tdp 200w cpu 60w let say fan take 25w thats roughly 300w isnt still 250w remaining dumb
4070 spike higher wattage depending individual part cpu go 120w using boost clock essentially built overclock activates load psus lose efficiency undergo wear tear closer get 100 load around 50 load efficient typically less efficient psu running heat produce heat wear tear common advice want exceed 7580 load psu matter convention common advice though im electrical engineer cant advise much risk id avoid overclocking choose upgrade cybenetics test xpg pylon 550whttpswwwcybeneticscomevaluationspsus1780ch looking actually seems pretty good across operational range right 550w load
main difference b450 b550 b550 exception board support pcie gen 4 since youre going 7600 gpu 8 pcie lane id recommend b550 motherboard pick motherboard based price size featureset dont even bother looking crossfire sli support technology obsolete year
thank much ill take account
personally cant find fault isnt anything would change besides case thats preference look like awesome build thing powerhouse
literally middle putting together build like anticipation card confident width card work case look like length fine
thank looking get muchany feedback cause expensive build said case come personal preference think itll good fit new fe cooler design
ive seen 5080 fe size 5090 fe ive seen youtuber build 5090 fractal ridgehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmx7kz3es6laabchanneldevynjohnston since 2 slot card think itll fit
look pretty damn good would prefer 2tb ssd sheer size game day thats personal preference
oh okay combo amd ryzen 5 7600x sapphire pulse rx 7800 xt fine right
absolutely ryzen 76007800xt combo run excellent

cyberpower listed software install pc monitor ups usb connection pc ups documented product site linked along download information
oh see sorry use one costco site due diligence checking particular unit ok dont forget youll need battery every year expensive
better replacing pc haha yeah battery availability deciding factor
get 3 way pwm fan splitter plug motherboard nobody forcing use built header lf iii also would buy nfa12 instead f12s much better radiator
solid component 7600 7900xt great 1440p machine whether good buy depends local price assume u id try find thermalright phantom spirit peerless assassin arctic cooler bad choice board generally expensive get depends pay compared board country

yeah poland board would reccomend
mb get 7900xt around 900 rtx4070ti super 990 dont think wait first afraid scalper second idk price drop

current pc eligible probably need change couple setting bios could update bios recent version setup properly window 11 default
able use license build meet spec likely bios setting issue
believe microsoft really doesnt care im running window 11 based retail copy window 8 bought 10 year ago simple tip problem window install come activated go setting activation run activation troubleshooter course find nothing done option check box say essentially ive recently changed hardware thats work every time note must logged microsoft account window license tracked
would want leave nice stable o fast gaming performance utter abomination spyware ai garbage advertisement absolutely probably tpm bios booting csm mode instead uefi am4 build certainly capable upgrading 11 really wanted
yeah setting thats causing incompatibility window 11 tpm 20 guess isnt enabled im able enable bios would able install window 10 new cpumotherboard upgrade window 11
thanks tip hopefully wont need use good know
im super excited updating window 11 believe lol know microsoft ending security update window 10 october going wait holiday sale season end year upgrade pc update window 11 decided tariff jack pc price like crazy
yes know system tpm 20 enabled still issue install via window updatecheck compatibility tool happens may need manual downloadinstall work fine dont think even need use flash drive though believe require full o reinstall
theyve stopped upgrading license back november last year could verify googling find install window 11 homepro use fully minus desktop customization without license key pretty much forever maybe one day find decent license deal sell waaaay cheaper 140 long dont install something extra paste command line youre well know join u linux next week get together smores therapeutically sharing microsoft ptsd
certain pc continue receive window 10 security update esu cost 61 usd per year u want go route info found herehttpslearnmicrosoftcomenuswindowswhatsnewextendedsecurityupdates
probably need update bios make sure uefi mode get prompted automatically upgrade 11 benchmarking new cyberpunk 2077 patch today pc 4090 21 slower window 11 24h2 window 10 22h2 even core isolation totally stripped awful
lol ive considered tbh im mainly worried game compatibility linux tbh pretty big steam library would suck bunch game apps dont run linux
jeeeez awful bad enough theyre increasing price gpus every year got ta kneecap performance forcing everyone jump window 11
youre first person shooter camp surely cant seem taken seriously without kernel level anticheat check protondbcom connect steam account making steam library visible publicly browse steam rating might even surprised number game native 268 game steam 5 freebie 1 paid marked broken 680 duplicate platform way checking rating mass rarely ever run across something cant play maybe im writing someone else might pas know good luck endevours
upgrade yet
okay right shocked many game rated gold platinum proton even like random indie game definitely expecting compatible boy maybe make switch
lol new pc part havent even arrived yet im still considering switching linux
8 core best performing cpu gaming 8 core dont need youre work pc
8 core 8 core isnt enough youre ask fastest gaming cpu market 8 core
7600x next logical jump gaming would 7800x3d also perfectly fine keep using 9900k
recommend ryzen 7 9700x meet need
well cpu compatible thats even concern gaming would target r77800x3dvor r79800x3d reach r77700 minimum would go r57500f fine every game market rtx4070s intel side maybe core ultra 265k honestly would stay amd though
right bit worried current cpu may outdated close definitely help
oh really guess make sense didnt realise 8 core enough gaming 8 guess thats also good stuff like photoshop effect n
thats good know guess wont get new cpu
game older use 6 less core use 6 core growing alot cyberpunk battlefel us 812 core
certainly dont right away try 4070 super 9900k see go feel like 9900k cant keep cpu heavy andor competitive game consider upgrading aaa game high quality setting 9900k probably still totally fine
im running 4070 ti super less powerful bit fringe 3600 still worth expectation think 9900k would nobrainer would budget expecting replace least 2 year game would obviously run better cpu upgrade budget sinking gpu gave better average result split budget got lesser gpu cpu upgrade hit cpu intensive game like verylate game automation title cyberpunk due crowdsize setting may worse result make sure check psu lazy certain good old 750w across state line bought temporary psu several year ago one 600w group regulated 750w m12ii
ive since last year issue performance singleplayer game like red dead 2 ff7 rebirth etc ever consider upgrading new cpu may need 8 core gaming
corsair rm750x bought 4070 super brother helping since friend knowledge pc build etc
moment there little benefit 8 core perhaps really heavy title m flight sim cyberpunk rt bell whistle exception rule
interesting make sense
example httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99950x18htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99950x18html difference 7600 6 core 9950x 16 core less 6 probably mostly clock speed 9950x clocked higher core count

resource fairly novice friendly something like msi afterburner took 10 minute research find known stable underclocks 5700xt recently build friend case thermal limiting bit hotter id liked even 100 fan sadly didnt thermal pad time repaste entered provided voltage discussion post lucky stable remember equipment come factory equal work one person may work ie 5 people bottom 5 card dont like provide overclocking advice beyond couple thing go wrong enter unstable clock voltage given plenty information available id rather let determine something feel comfortable send people worked specific card key may troubleshoot way cant find information set first place dont think great idea tell input value doesnt set someone success bottom 5 issue tip add msi afterburner always running program need running overclock hold select start window set unstable underclock cause window boot loop usually fixed holding ctrl login screen sometimes requires troubleshooting tip dont start window stable underclock
want add also undervolt amd card amd driver well mentioned nvidia card mention also undervolt underclock performance loss though want major power saving undervolting underclocking way go

itx cheap bro
top line budget itx motherboard go together
yeah thinking since smaller motherboard would cheaper lol
post immediately contradicting statement
opposite
like triple paradox
basically depends model big enough go 8gb vram
5700xt used hope find one europe
really depends lucky get dlss getting pretty nice upgrade dlss 4 maybe 2060 super 5700xt bad choice either im also familiar local market could worse better
yup thats definitely possible 100
pretty beefy cpu maybe step 9700x go 7800xt gpu get amd smart access memory wombo combo
first thing first need set budget best keep budget youll feel like got money worth country live
dont list resolution monitor thats pretty important 1080 4070 almost certainly fine higher though may want look 4080 4070ti super mentioned
live u budget around 1800
httpspcpartpickercomlistqr6974 7900xtx performs well 4080super prefer nvidia substitute 4070 ti super found httpswwwwalmartcomipasustufgamingnvidiageforcertx4070tisuperoceditiongraphicscardpcie4016gbgddr6xhdmi21adisplayport14atufrtx4070tiso16ggaming5370865394 reason there price motherboard ram microcenter offer great bundle combo cpumoboram
im kinda new pc building iirc 4070s gpu doesnt 16 gb vram personally wouldnt even consider given option amd seems offer really good raw performance lack ray tracing nongaming application frame rate want maybe go 7900xt personally id go 4070ti super im little biased bc one

yeah thats high end go assume looking save money non performant part go value excellent choice given money appear object 299 psu 499 motherboard rather decadent say least though someone said wifi am5 mb trash x870 steel legend fly strix picked detachable antenna x870 tomahawk also run fantastic motherboard overall also one plastic antenna far worse chopstick sticking back cheaper x870 steel legend id plug cable either way thats option believe case come without case fan case youll want add intake
look good pretty much cant get better gaming rig could save money look want best best
fyi think o11 come case fan
5090 youll apparently wanting game 4k dont see gaining much expensive cpu maybe something else planned 600 amd chip
definitely planning making last several year think look another psu current pc use wifi time got cable plug necessary thanks think im gon na go lian li fan thinner led light like look need figure exactly need think controller least
yeah im going im hoping last many many year lol dont wan na sacrifice performance part unnecessarily expensive
thanks like look lian li fan ill probably go
many title 5090 4k push even 9800x3d even game still primarily dependent gpu youll want consistent frame pacing possible given current part selection place op could save money cpu would among last
definitely planning making last several year would hope p still specific choice motherboard wont aid necessarily though nothing wrong money object extremely premium board think look another psu wouldnt spend 300 platinum 1300w psu config 1000w part premium think im gon na go lian li fan thinner led light mount 3 140mm bottom 3 140mm side intake might want get reverse blade fan avoid looking frame going anyway might well
need big psu question try looking alternative httpshwbusterscombestpicksbestatxv3pcie5readypsuspickshardwarebustershttpshwbusterscombestpicksbestatxv3pcie5readypsuspickshardwarebusters
starter probably dont need 500 motherboard pcie 50 ssd
yeah others said pcie gen 5 ssds overkill wont boot game faster reduce loading time gen 4 drive much cheaper motherboard get something doesnt use shared lane gen 5 x16 slot might reduce 5090 performance dont know one selected something keep mind
psu way overkill 1000w gold atier community list fine must 1300w id go super flower leadex vii xg 1300w 80 gold 100 less newegg dont wan na sacrifice performance youll technically sacrificing onpaper performance id go either 2tb sn850x samsung 990 evo plus 100 less gen4 shouldnt really affect ingame performance fps practical perceivable way id also go midtier motherboard unless advanced overclocking drawback may number chafan header youll need check manual buying depending fan 6000mhz ram doesnt look like probably shave another 250 shave almost 450 lastly check fractal design north fractal design north xl like north
like particularly sl innifty plan making build exactly white realized o11 didnt fan wanted make sure got make mistake almost
dont plan 4k gaming maybe light work time time ive heard much good cpu tho feel like also good future thought mb
nothing past testing 4090 indicates cpu small role current game 4k resolution core usage part game need available cpu core
would hope p praying dont make expensive mistake build process p still specific choice motherboard wont aid necessarily though nothing wrong money object extremely premium board mean dont want spend money sake looking asus x870f well think thatd better fit wouldnt spend 300 platinum 1300w psu config 1000w part premium oh really think 1000w would enough according pcpp im already pushing 850w thought 250w expected draw
mean asus board x870 general yeah know went back forth whether go pcie 4 5 m2 guess think overkill
yes exactly love white build aesthetic gon na look damn clean hopefully get hand 50series reasonably soon lol
also mentioned post solid rather expensive certainly far youd need gaming experience itll offer performance hardly usable feature gaming system solid board cost third cpu great apparently sell frequently msrp 480
mean dont want spend money sake looking asus x870f well think thatd better fit also premium board work well cpugpu quality b850 would also fine cheaper x870 nothing wrong part selection pricey side oh really think 1000w would enough 850w worst case scenario hardware 100 granted gpu often 100 also plenty psus fall term price 1200w gold thermaltake greathttpspcpartpickercomproductcnymp6thermaltaketoughpowergf3ttpremium1200w80goldcertifiedfullymodularatxpowersupplypstpd1200fnfagu4 must higher rated psu also lianli edgehttpspcpartpickercomproductyykh99lianliedge1300w80platinumcertifiedfullymodularatxpowersupplyeg1300 make sure work particualr case
motherboard x870 usually overkill unless absolutely need usb 4 wifi7 also cheaper x870 board ssd barely application benefit pcie 40 let alone 50

definitely dont need atm current router wifi6 figured itd nice prepare eventual upgrade see thanks ill look pcie 4 drive instead

4070ti substantially faster card advantage 6800 16gb vram 320 good deal id personally go 4070ti price steal

9700x would likely fine 1440p gpus depends specific game httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewscpuhierarchy4312htmlhttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewscpuhierarchy4312html
okay great thank help appreciate ill take look link
1080p 60 fps 3070 dont need much could buy something like ryzen 7600 fine 7800x3d great choice afford
need know budget say id probably go am4 playing card right enough would recc getting 5600 instead 5500gt latter cpu integrated graphic slower 5600 seeing build already gpu needed
youre reusing bunch part 970 psu id continue use used part save extra money 970 fast modern integrated graphic youre upgrading gpu doesnt make sense anticipate future upgrade heavy investment am5 platform save 100 invest proper overhaul
think youll upgrading rig point am4 still good budget option definitely worth considering am5 little runway upgradability road 34 year want better cpu youll able buy something newer drop since am5 confirmed support till 2027 expect new gen cpu launch sold year date 10700x3d come would simple upgrade am4 offer already market probably dry point neither wrong depends see interest build going future 9 always chance might even interested computer 4 year
am5 unless budget overriding factor
budget would around 350 top since 9 year old getting digital drawing pc gaming reason going integrated graphic cpu would since know 970 somewhat dated would hate fail next need invest new gpu last minute
make sense would say 16gb 32gb make much difference kind budget am4 build said 970 fast modern integrated graphic mean 5500gt would give performance
well planning getting vr headset turn 11 told 8th birthday sister bought quest 2 birthday return due young make difference would say would like see mobocpuram give u performance lifespan old unit gave decade earlier would say mid teen end getting blender moho debut
ram level isnt going massive difference worth 3080 youd better spending exact amount gpu cpu upgrade im advising far gpu one particular worse dedicated gpu also irrelevant since already continue use upgrade get used set also feel like youre rushing upgrade gpu doesnt make sense upgrade cpu wait gpu dont ton knowledge running graphical software bunch type work youd get improvement w gpu upgrade id curious mentioned mobo might failing give impression
id probably say am5 route going give flexibility last longer am4 im still rocking am4 system buy today id definitely go am5
well scenario happened wife old intel i54570k build month back also built around 2014 started turning randomly eventually blue screen death redid thermal paste cleaning issue happened eventually got new cpumoboram
expected lifespan op want side ripe avocado am5 way go later line could upgrade another 65w tdp cpu quick upgrade current cpu isnt cutting a620 motherboard thinking doesnt handle higher tdp cpu well 65w tdp cpu perfectly fine
always try take apart clean everything including thermal paste totally crap sound like borrowed time dont know gpu health either there chance crap depending financial situation benefit going am4 capable majority gpus assuming youre keeping replacement gpu choose upgrade gpu cost am4 200 case usednew even upgrade line 7800xt4070 point feel like still run well mean say dont think youd missing 510 performance 5600 v 7600x cpu feel like youre trying get basic computer going question longevity investment current component limit upgradability 550w psu ancient mobo cpu gpu rapidly becoming phased minrequirement game setting genuinely obviously amd pushing new am4 cpu last year think am4 lot value adequate need
7700 xt definitely
7700xt 4060ti would probably upgrade orange man imposing tarrifs price could go new gpus coming soon higher end 100 drop price lower mid range card
dont budget ill wait
offense already answer ask lol
didnt like uncertain ppl tell 4060ti better thats
people dont eye look benchmark considering 4060ti 16gb one worth anything expensive way powerful 7800xt anyone say 4060ti better 7700xt 7800xt trying ragebait
current gpu unless youre getting cpu bottlenecking especially low re low quality setings high fps esports game like cs2 newer cpu gpu intensive game check cpu bottlenecking game play bad cpu upgrade may help 1440p probably minimal least worth cost new cpurammobo espcially inflated 9800x3d price httpswwwpcworldcomarticle1955495pcbottleneckscpuorcpulimitinggamingperformancehtmlhttpswwwpcworldcomarticle1955495pcbottleneckscpuorcpulimitinggamingperformancehtml

itll pretty huge upgrade move cpu thats 5 generation newer limitation gpu 3080 still damn good gpu
yes absolutely worth 10gb 3080 cpu im hitting cpu limitation reasonably often also playing 1440p slightly better gpu probably lessoverclocked cpu suspect youll hitting often obviously wont help turn setting game game lowering setting still doesnt get nice framerates new cpu definitely help im planning exact upgrade 9800x3ds ever become actually purchasable itll also leave perfectly positioned gpu upgrade next year
would say replace mb dont know symptom cpu failure maybe specific cpu didnt list spec go microcenter take psu see test cant really add much youve seemingly performed due diligence update post figure gots know
spec want lookhttpspcpartpickercomlistbzpzyd tried looking around see anyone similar spec issue seem luck pulling hair one month dissatisfied little feel know
would say yes long enough pcie connector 3080 ti wouldnt recommend buying one point though unless good deal 5600x may bottleneck especially high fps low quality setting esports type game lower resolution

yes refund sure also dont mix go xt ryzen always better since amd try make compatible kin
ok thanks shouldnt upgrade like better cpu like put 70 additional buck good one btw 7600x good like 7700xt
7500f
ok thanks advice going amd gpu btw cuz like idk
7600x good 7700xt get instead 7700x 280 point itd get better gpu cheapest 7800xt 489 80 also depends psu would least 750w

tldr
thats fair youre right forgot update part list havent bought gpu yet waiting 5080 try 5090 well
heyyyy part buddy thankfully didnt issue like everything detected correctly right away sn850x
actually paid 200 know 4tb ssds around 100 cause couldnt find one paid hear ram im sure thats much use use case v storage looking
lol basically man build computer share experience also pic
sound like already waited long build new pc another couple month wont hurt
could always build pc use igpu get thing setup
youre asking dumb pick component idea getting particular gpu near future dont think dumb see component sale good price might dumb buy also expect see decent price drop near future existing gpus performance rtx 5070 9070 end seem depends bit amd theyre incredibly good shooting foot horrible pricing launch quickly correcting month two hard know 9070 available sane price
dont know well 9070 perform much cost available release either wait find

hi corsair cv500 think good psu

ive done research everyone recommends least 550w one doubt also checked msi psu calculator say pc us least 497w rtx3060 havent wanted connect moment doubt want upgrade recommend one httpslatammsicompowersupplymaga600dnhttpslatammsicompowersupplymaga600dn also saw cx550 httpswwwcorsaircomusesppsucp9020277nacxseriescx550550watt80plusbronzeatxpowersupplycp9020277nasrsltidafmbooqz9g5ltvft2oi6acwqk2xz4aginbmh0l8yiw0qzg0rfqehk3rhttpswwwcorsaircomusesppsucp9020277nacxseriescx550550watt80plusbronzeatxpowersupplycp9020277nasrsltidafmbooqz9g5ltvft2oi6acwqk2xz4aginbmh0l8yiw0qzg0rfqehk3r
550w definitely preferable 500 people used 500 3060 online wattage calculator purposefully overestimate wattage stay safe side see upgrading future 600w even 650700w psu would good dont know anything specific one tho dont see upgrading higher tiered hardware 550w corsair good

marvel rival listed minimum 1060rx 580 30 powerful current gpu plus vram botleneck 4gib low best upgrade gpu followed cpu
rx 570 infinitely better integrated throw
rx570 quite weak today standard still infinitely better integrated graphic would throw 8700 system
would go 7500f alihttpswwwaliexpressusitem3256805676873344htmlspma2g0oproductlistmain15800jj4hjj4hbqalgopvid809d0fecfb904997b5dbaf359e5588d7algoexpid809d0fecfb904997b5dbaf359e5588d70pdpnpi440dis21usd212983521146672121212983521146672140211b807017380104898428495e2fe3211200004345030586221sea21us21021abxcurpageloguidf6qbfej9urqautparamurlscene3asearch7cqueryfrom3a 145 build like httpspcpartpickercomlistncwprm software us utilizes 12 core therefore faster core better 7500f5800x decent cooler decent b850 motherboard 32gb fast ram faster reliable ssd wouldnt recommend going older a770 arc b series either go b570 wait b580 psu enough overall better performance 50 buck less
already am4 mb try scrape 20 maybe getting cheaper mb get 5600 maybe 12400 decently faster worth extra money
r55500 fine rx580 course weak part maybe keep eye better gpu go cpu end course fine use
well gpu okay think thats important cs2 valorant think competitive game handle better powerful gpu look i512400f think handle better im sure
rx580 able run game may lower graphic resolution play smoothly used one played minecraft pretty ok 1080p high cs2 also ok 1080p fps often 100 sometimes dipped 60 cpu truly as buttcheeks like worse r5 1600x maybe upgrading first would good move
confirm am4 motherboard proceed upgrade update bios prior installing new cpu confirm mobo compatible new cpu possible go 56005600x
dont know ill look thanks ill look 12400
think 12400 good shot handle well modern game upgrading cpu id look intel edit cpu microprocessor good point forgot mentioned
thats meant earlier rx580 isnt enough modern game gpu upgrade expensive asf thats think cpu better op budget
yeah cpu truly bad mean dont remember last time played 1920x1080 always play stretched cause look better overclock monitor
yeah saw thats little bit better r5 amd cpu mobo put intel
found amd gpus way problematic hard use less feature versatility well thats id get nvidia never tried amd cpu
hw capable handling uw1440p drive mine alienware 34dwf 6800xt far handle thing decently well though im hoping get 5070ti decent price month imho 219 better format 169 gaming havent yet ran game doesnt support format playing cinematic game cp2077 witcher etc uw amazing even oled said recent game im playing deltaforce run 169 cant modify ui map ui info stuck side screen cs2 example allow move making harder use
work computer yeah ultrawides great
run 3440x1440p monitor great gaming work im looking keeping resolution upgrading oled panel
3440x1440 would never go back 169
ultrawide great work ok game id prefer regular aspect ratio game
oled sure assuming know risk burn comfortable uw preference completely personally dont like many people
ultrawide great work mostly play jrpgs strategy game support rarely big aaa support ultra wide
gotcha thanks advice
roger
gotcha could elaborate experience gaming
regular aspect ratio game game dont support aspect ratio ultrawides turning look various aspect side screen
know risk burn actually let look
excellent havent run single issue game supporting resolution rare exception sometimes cutscenes locked specific aspect ratio get temporary black bar cutscenes
there modern game dont support one dont usually esports title still play 219 vertical view cut bit play game 169 ive using ultrawide 7 year fantastic there little reason go back 169 even want play game 169 set game 169 work amazing downside oled amazing best upgrade ive ever made would probably go normal work unless youve got solid warranty cover burn get burned eventually prepare
many older game wont work ultrawide modern game black bar side including elden ring plague tale ultrawide also annoying game strategy game constantly move ui element located opposite side screen example civ end turn button tech tree located opposite corner making move mouse way across every single turn ultrawide fine ideal primary use gaming imho
a3 165mm cpu clearence forzn 160mm fine a3 glass panel doesnt great gpu airflow
thanks saw would clear spec wondering airflow planned sticking mesh side panel anyway case fan strategy bit mess trying maintain positive air pressure tight case
used a3 mesh side friend build 7800x3d cooled noctua u12 4080super gpu used 3 120 mm additional fan 2 exhaust mounted top side towards rear addition one come case rear side towards top 1 side intake situated towards front case blow air towards cpu cooler intake gpu doesnt seem need fan since intake easily bottom case also couldnt fit gpu bottom case enough room cpu temp pretty toasty still withing spec adding additional fan became much better
good know thanks side mount psu able fit side fan looking lian li edge psu
used offset mount mounted front case remember correctly used corsair rm750 psu 160mm length
might look psu think edge bit longer needed little connector offset
check lian li site pretty extensive guide psu size supported mounting offset use long one remember correctly
im sure get fit also fitting fan side bracket time ive watching ton build video pretty popular matx case youtube worst case scenario end case fan cant cram build end returning im trying real hard make sure positive pressure situation mesh terrible dust otherwise
gl
9900x lulz 9900k 9900x know lame joke ok ill see serious note depending price 7700 9700 8 core would already significantly faster current cpu also faster 12900 non core workload am5 likely allow upgrade cpu future model keep mb amd said theyll support platform 2027 though thats necessarily guarantee support next gen cpu maybe theyll 2 platform parallel though think thats unlikely
microcenter 9700x bundle would probably best bet 500 buck 7600x3d would obviously better pick pure gaming pc end lot video rendering go core instead cache
u somewhere else
whats budget

way platform dead 12400f
yes lga1700 platform intel 12 1314th gen dead meaning new cpu coming since intel replaced lga1851 new core ultra cpu
everything fine power supply timebomb disguise would recommend changing something isnt terrible asap
thank
idk change anything buy 600w 500
could 1000w 1500w still wouldnt use thermaltake smart unit awful
thank ill upgrade asap suggestion
id go asus pro art x870e assuming budget doesnt matter budget matter cheapest x870 available still beast
one x870e maybe gigabyte aorus msi tomahawk x870e unless need onboard dual ethernet feel carbon wifi overpriced ive bad experience asus others work cant say make bad motherboards
currently hesitating taichi tomahawk know ethernet port issue seems people experiencing ethernet issue 870 board
im sorry dont know x670e use wifi problem ethernet port initial setup beyond say
minecraft processor based would suggest stronger cpu perhaps weaker gpu assuming budget also would suggest ram cl3032
thanks
problem best luck pc
turn output fan around there almost reason exhaust fan modern case far sealed benefit bringing cool outside virtually always greater benefit pushing heated air get forced cooler air mesh opening anyway
case sits bookshelf behind im seated bottom shelf cut ducted would like push much fresh air possible 6 pushing radiator know power fan reversed argb
6 pushing radiator youre making aios inefficient possible using warmed case air instead fresh air outside bringing much air case possible pick rad want efficient whichever one going less heat producing component switch fan exhaust intake mine id try recording temp highest stress situation like occt psu test instance id turn fan intake record new reading see difference wasnt enough id try one aio fan exhaust intake way figure produce best result except esthetic reason there really reason buy reverse fan turn around whatever fan
yes aesthetic matter yes pushing air warmed case rad im aware im asking one know powerful fan
cheapest cpu upgrade gaming would 5700x3d largely depends playing game pushing hit 240fps similar high frame rate maxing visuals running lower fps maxing visuals gpu bound cpu upgrade wont change much
exactly problem specific instance trying game 4k could difficult system resulting low framerates
think best option buy either 5700x3d 5800x3d said didnt post monitor spec may matter 4k monitor thats 60hz
qvo great ssd throttle easier harder samsung nvme would using o drive doubt ever notice much also run game program fine long o drive second would cpu 5700x3d5800x3d would give 3090 better chance maximising fps am4 3900x always bit oddball 66 core setup bit half baked exactly went 3950x get 3080 upgrading time soon x3ds less brute multi core performance better single core power still pretty powerful system wont hold well 4090 9800x3d available 5090 9950x3d stomp ground given chance 3950x 3080 still plenty run professional program need well use gaming without feeling much upgrade urge year buying care somewhat small bottleneck
bottlenecking component time cpu gpu severely outdated compared piece build nothing bottlenecking anything
like max setting possible consistent 170fps thats current monitor run
find im unable run game maxed nowadays keeping consistently high frame even minecraft example struggle im running even basic shader average render distance less wondering would first component replace looking keep pc semi date replacing part every year
two monitor depending game im playing one 170hz 2k monitor 60hz 4k monitor part run 2k monitor like max many setting possible consistent 170fps
reason recommending 5700 etc mb am4 locked correct board different socket could push cpu trying understand work also would mb able run ddr5 ram would dated
fair enough guess question whats weakest link aka would want replace first replacing thing one one
gaming main use 5700x3d 5800x3d find one deal used market game see huge gain x3d cache gaming 5900x also valid drop check gpu helpful back ever game watching usage second monitor use task manager hwinfo64 etc one use overlay gpu usage make sure fps capped testing 90100 gpu usage everything good lower gpu helpful back reasonable amount lower
general 1440p transition area gpu start mattering cpu 4k little point upgrading cpu mostly gpu carrying load point since want 170fps id evaluating gpu specific game want play tell running cyberpunk 4k 4090 eye candy dlss 90110fps situation minecraft situation sound bit weird perhaps running process background dragging pc
locked bit weird term use literally way using another socket platform am4 socket am4 ddr5 locked platform like ddr4 dd3 am4 work ddr4 am5 work ddr5 1700 work ddr4 ddr5 motherboard either would get am5 motherboard need am5 cpu ddr5 yes cheapest upgrading within am4
thats really good know thank helpful answer already asked someone else reason 575800 youre recommending mb am4 locked correct
yea basically best gaming cpu drop motherboard without upgrading full platform 5800x3d5700x3d stuff gaming highest 5950x cheaper option 5900x far ram pretty maxed speed 3600 fast comfortably run 11 sync something check current set download zen timing see fclk showing 1800 manually set 1800 match 3600 mt money burn upgrade would 9800x3d am5 mobo x870e x670e set ddr5 6000cl30

oled get good 4k lcd monitor save 500 gpu upgrade doesnt make sense unless youre upgrading monitor anyways need fine upscalingframe gen 60fps experience 4k modern title though im sure exactly work resolution go cpu less potential bottleneck
higher resolution gpu used cpu generally get monitor
going 4k would make gpu bounded bottleneck there reason think youll one upscaling
higher resolution mean less bottleneck want game 4k get monitor want higher frame 1440p upgrade cpu
monitor wootcomhttpwootcom samsung g8 sale 799 32in 4k 240hrz oled web o tizen
frame cpu usage higher resolution gpu usage
setup wont see difference upgrading hardware youre already playing max setting oled change way see world though personally didnt get oled monitor thought gimmick much hassle got oled tv hooked ps5 man game completely different could believe needless say next monitor oled im sold
keep saving next full blown upgrade
wont upgrade next 5 year think oled monitor best option
hell youre good bit stellaris chug lategame system still capable 1080p gaming machine anything latest aaa game upgrade first depend need youre feeling performance slip newest aaa game punish entire system 1080p cpu weak point require new cpu motherboard likely ram get back speed youre picking older game want push 4k new monitor tv gpu need replaced enjoy new pc dude keep eye game dont meet expectation assess youd need make good experience
cpu must gpu run game 1080p cpu weakest point dont think need 4k monitor anything else 1440p upgrading cpu get budget 16gb ram enough aaa game 8gb would bit problematic okay
dont really play aaa probably console dont really anything less 10 year old im playing doubt play morrowind new vagas 4k anyway dont know im dont want break pc think worth upgrading
dont play aaa game wont playing anything 1080p mainly morrowind new vagas bit minecraft recommend good option could handle game better like city skyline wont better expensive clue look

there little point upgrading cpu fastest thing could upgrade would marginally benefit could potentially upgrade gpu there still cpu bedroom cod similar multiplayer title least beyond youre getting performance want game time new system
depends budget case definitely salvaged well ssd psu could also possibly saved decent enough watt potential upgrade cooler depends work new platform go am5 youll replace cpu motherboard ram money low could go am4 keep ddr4 ram
cpu upgrade going mean new cpumoboramcooler depending psu gpu upgrade could also mean gpupsu point weve replaced everything except ssd case 2tb nvme ssd drive terribly priced throw one youre left old case reason replace like one part away new build
careful using nvme slot motherboards lane sharing pci could reduce speed gpu pci slot make sure read manual buying mobo pci go 16x 8x shared certain nvme slot gigabyte x870 aorus elite wifi 7
32 gb fine dont build around cpu gpu wait till march amd gon na drop bomb mid range
32 enough gaming
go msi ram 32 fine look price see good deal 64 go 4 nvme absolute necessity buy pcie nvme adapter card dont limit selection mobos 4 nvme slot

alright ill tell situationsee post dor detailed info minor saving money decent pc doenst run like dogshit like actual 8yo laptop target 1000 total pc monitor ill ask keyboard like show money get parent pay want want since big issue pay 500 buck cause like summer trip group go spending money keyboard would drastically alter performance im edging 1440p territory 6700xt unless get better option current market stabilizes belive membrane keyboard im sure taste switch hate membrane slow unreliable anythings upgrade even tried dumpster clicky keyboard unfortunately key needed didnt work better mainly ergonomically since made self designed paltop stand lift monitor neck doesnt suffer laptop ergonomics tested like light tactiles dont want clickies linear fine gota get used never could cant say anything really preference ill use ill get basic mod ill get serviceable state im referencing hippios tech video best budget keyboard random name blue fade one like 20 buck modded bit fine ofc compared expensive stuff great come wont standard judging 100 keyboard 20 one think may understand situation bit better decided nice day ill take look brand mentioned
thanks really helpful u like say woots state show u flag idk applies spanish user anyway thank ill lookout sadly 30smth one switch tad heavy liking theyre great deal
ive seen doubleshot keycaps cheap one ofc one ate cheapest cheap matter buying cheap keycap set arent expensive need software mean need driver run im gon na macro dont care rgb need backlight keyboard tinker reach preffered setting since im keyboard im hard stuck membrane keyboard user think anything upgrade slow sometimes non registering keyboard prefer slight tactile probably used membrane still small bump like mx brown havei tested store want heavy stuff like see many writer want tactiles im light switch enjoyer5040g actuation force like really dont care mutch specific cheap keyboard cant ask much
honestly idea woot ship outside u havent even ordered see posted often
searched say isnt statecountryprovince listed ship internationally exception shirt woot currently ship outside contiguous 48 united state unlucky guess time look similar stuff spain ill also looking marketplace doubt keychron sutch people tend pc dumb fault theyre sold 70 1080p 27 monitor lot crap va crap ip 30 proper stuff seems expensive conparasion way better people seem actually research stuff care nice day

sure
buy whichever find stock sign point extremely limited supply 5090s
card 5080 5090 going sell second end ebay 3 time much time anyone get card msrp itll probably towards end year
honestly speaking wait till end year rush think point stock normalize
yeah rush buy asap since already 4090 want get better one
look fine
gpu board 1440p upgrading cpu wont much feeling lacking youre experiencing rx 6600 i3 12100f try sell i3 12100f buy used i7 12700f increase corethread count without upgrading rx 6600 youre going see much performance increase 1440p id recommend selling upgrading rx 6600 see performance increase selling already decrease cost upgrade best move little loss wallet
i7 12th gen get one good price
yeah fine
bought card reference version ebay mined three year later still going strong result may differ price right make sure date accompanying benchmark result
ability return defective test thing get sure run within spec without issue repaste heat sink ive purchased several used card year one bad case glad ability return
depends used taken care please make sure option return defective
think ok bought rtx3090 back late 2021 mine etherium changed became unprofitable stopped late spring 2022 5 month put game pc still work great even today undervolted mining minimize power draw im sure helped
tested three 3070s mined year theyre fine
even burned full wattage whole time still long life ahead usually profitable underpower card never get hot temp matter still test doesnt hit max heat put load could indicate paste died
change thermalpads paste
seller give 1 day guarantee guess enough time site im buying say isnt expecting issue 30 day return site popular site argentina live trust
soon get test doesnt run correctly start return

perform well youre using
well didnt test well html take time thing wanted know people use web developing
web development anything system modern youre fine
difficult imagine less demanding task capable running notepad displaying webpage already far powerful hardware youll ever need given youve posted reddit website say nothing worry
okay thanks worried complex html function get probably good peripheral
try open third slot case first hole smal pcie slot
seems third pic lined correct slot without third slot open gpu wont slide way fill two slot output port
course thats io wbax210 one better option around 50 usd
im assuming m2 port board already filled honestly isnt great plan secondary x16 slot board run pcie20 four lane allocated assuming youre going using pcie30 drive mean half bandwidth expects put pcie wifi card slot run x2 mode meaning pcie3 drive 25 expected bandwidth youre using pcie4 drive worse 125 expected bandwidth could would use usb wifi adapter avoid pcie slot running x2 mode isnt much difference folk running pcie3 pcie4 drive difference likely noticeable cut available bandwidth inhalf using pcie wifi card
done issue one probably consider available slot board except main graphic card slot pcie20 lane configuration 411 however use either x1 slot secondary slot x16 slot configured x4 drop x2 putting something like pcie3 drive m2 adapter youd already losing 50 bandwidth form pcie2 interface putting wifi adapter cut another 12 bandwidth
mentioned id 1 m2 hdd ssd slotted wouldnt case lose bandwidth would
thanks clarification suppose simply saying yup sure doesnt cut lol unsure op strictly using onboard m2 asking expansion card addition m2 though
im using one m2 onboard slot im planning get another one want pcie adapter still bad idea id use x1 slot beneath graphic card right
yes thats fine
wouldnt get whole lose bandwidth psimwork suggests one m2
unless there specsheet im missing pull bandwidth sata 56 leaving pcie lane unaffected
ahh okay cool thanks help really appreciate last question effected fact also hdd ssd plugged
would waste money
shouldnt matter wattage needed wont efficient psus run efficient 50 load
seen efficiency chart server unit maximum 5080 percent seen anything similar desktop server almost always operates capacity desktop gaming idle mode
assuming primary task gaming would actually look 7600x rather 7700x much different gaming 7700x choice cpu 7800x3d 7600xtough call honestly monitor resolution 1440p higher 7800x3d likely overkill could nice event youre trying achieve super high ie 180 fps situation however youre able something like downgrade 7600x use saving get upgrade elsewhere ie going 1tb ssd 2tb going crap power supply something good money would probably better allocated way see u difference 7600x 7800x3d 260 possible within difference 4070s 4070 ti honestly likely depending resolution game play 4070 ti 7800x3d upgrade
much extra wouldnt pay 200 extra 7800x3d also would probably go ryzen 7600 100 less unless need core work stuff
1080p 180hz monitor would get bottlenecked 7600x cpu heavy game tarkov
choose amd new build go intel u already lga 1700 mobo know youre
neither get amd
country
upgrading cpu building whole new system
game going okay 1440p 14400f 5060w tdp great cpu price
14600k sure upgrade 14900k line 14600k solid cpu last id personally recommend overclocking get 1520 extra performance know
neither cpu gpu cpu amd am5 way go 7600 example gpu wait february 5070 probably performance 4070ti super 550
14600k
""
less vram though looking 5070ti
also considered waiting 5070ti probably hard get one
vram cool paying 250 4gb extra vram far less cool pov everyone free please money obviously
recommending card lower spec one mentioned stupid thats corrected
ok buddy im glad 250 mean nothing take care
making personal trying help guy made post want gpu recommend worse one
6700 xt 6750 xt find one either 7600 xt b580
wary b580 recs card good must modern possible cpu properly utilize older chip loses performance something like 8600k looking easy 4050 less performance 4060 1080p resolution
nah bro dont listen honestly get ryzen 4070
planning using
6750xt 6700xt b580 7600xt order best best haha
depends whats cpu intel b580 great choice modern enough powerful enough cpu currently 750ti tell youre probably running 9800x3d nvidia 4060 around 300350 think modern support ray tracing dlss4 upscaling single frame frame generation buuuuuut got much vram amd 7600 price range support upto fsr31 released fsr4 upscaling fsr 3 good dlss almost example also amd card arent good ray tracing ray tracing becoming far prevalent game even game coming minimum requirement early day ray tracing gimmick im afraid low budget like youre probably better going second hand nvidia 3080 perform rather well across board amd 6800xt better perform slightly better 3080 older rasterised game 3080 perform lot better raytraced game depends want gpu going forward
lol literally google history last 3 day
3070 used 3080 got decent psu 750w
lol testing 750ti right would recommend rx 6600 used necessary
guy dont care cpu cpu old 750ti je definitely need new one
stretch bit rx 6750 xt 360390 euro best youll get price range
3080 ebay
either rx6600 190 usd b570 230 usd b580 250 usd find one say nvidia shouldnt even considered lower budget
able find 6800 350e better option 3070 vram
httpsdepcpartpickercomproductprqkhxacernitroocradeonrx7600xt16gbvideocarddpz3lwwp02 used rx6800xt
id look local used market see obviously going city dependent especially upgrade cycle like likely find good deal something budget range bought 3060ti month ago 300cad equivalent 200euro obviously different market worth shot
rx6700xt
try find 7800xti buy one 420efor 70e moreyou get card next 5y
honestly may need cpu upgrade since aint focus may able find b580 arent going pcvr price range
b580 competition find one msrp
intel arc b580 competition ups budget get awesome card
ebay easly find rx 6800 around 300400 rx 6800 xt 450 16gb vram excellent 1440p
7800xt
cant find b580 retail b570 also seems perform really well think change drastic doesnt really matter get
b580
rtx 5090
rtx 4060 330 amazon
many people blindly recommend specific brand simply fan focus actually plan pc choose hardware based need thats
4090 549 best budget gpu 2025 imo realistically speaking buy something better installment instead something like 6750 xt wait amd releasing gpu next month two first
attest got 6700xt two year ago point 300 second hand regret one caveat install adrenalin use display driver alone
using gaming would suggest ryzen 4070tix3d super
ztt leaking aha
750 ti cpu meant 750 ti need new cpu
yeah given he running 750ti depending cpu he gon na run driver overhead issue mean card absolutely brilliant price dont get wrong need somewhat modern cpu work
also dont really good cpu
4090 549 going 2000
whats wrong adrenaline
1 yes thats said quote previous comment currently 750ti tell youre probably running 9800x3d thats british gently sarcastic way saying probably dated cpu also need upgrade 2 time necessarily buddy guy budget clearly suitable cpu release 750ti hed 4770k yes wouldnt run 4770k buuuuuut h mightve upgraded cpumobo meantime even 1 generation newer 5930k suitable 3080 sure hed struggle bit modern title youd surprised 5930k still handle didnt upgrade 5930k 12th gen released one one game dropped 90fps first second race vr playing automobilista 2 lot first second race car bunched slightly choppy 5 second absolutely fine run physic vehicle screen one core every game still fine id hazard guess itd still absolutely fine overclocked course 46ghz running manually tuned quad channel ddr4 3200c13 originally 4400c19 slowed 3200 manually tightened timing c12c13 equivalent point op savvy hardware buyer could running 89 year old cpu newer isnt terribly useless today coupled 3080 6800xt would still rock although id personally go 3080 even though 6800xt better choice release rt back less prevalent soon become mandatory example indian jones minimum spec requires rt capability amd 6000 series gpus suck rt he running amd 3000 series 750ti year 750ti released lot people upgrade cycle cpu gpu cpu instead building one allnew pc outright he also going fine 30 series nvidia 6000 series gpu yes could also upgrade cpu 5700x3d 5800x3d 3600x oc fclk 1900mhz manually tuned 3800mts ram would still pretty sweet today also
youre totally right dont know went head certainly could affect performance wed need know cpu sure
hell related intel card weak cpu suffer card rather wont see performance increase

make game objectively worse build window kept trying override driver installed keep dduing also full screen stutter changing volume reason could never figure soon got rid adrenalin left driver place every single issue disappeared

go ahead drop link brother
thinking 3090 4090 still 1200
appreciate putting link mate thanks save
maybe universe timeline nvidia released 4090 549
httpsukpcpartpickercomlist4s7l4p better ram choice pretty slow ryzen work better faster ram 6000mt cl30 sweetspot 3000d greatest term build quality would recommend going 4000d 4000d frame instead save bit money psu cooler enough cpu yes easily enough aio would mainly aesthetic choice realise ssd strange choice upgrade happen already one sure thats fine budget would include nvme ssd get go would like know harder install type havent seen anyone installing ssd style yet nothing hard involves cable need sata data sata power also psu overkill 750w appropriately sized
cheer mate help lot
tried connecting hdmi cable motherboard gpu
first thing take breather u building pc first build black screened hot minute part experience help get ya accustomed troubleshooting second led indicator motherboard boot error example line led next ram cpu gpu etc lit trying boot give place start edit motherboard doesnt boot indicator checking see ram properly seated slot b correct ram slot often 2nd 4th slot good place start

yes
seen led indicator motherboard small light bios flashback

make bios update use different usb stick using correct usb port updating
ok probably doesnt tried reseating ram

good wan na clarify though there nothing wrong using kryonaut made long term stability kryo name relation ice less likely freeze using nitrogen
make lot sense thank
question good case look different get one like look
yeah thinking fit cpu cooler 5mm clearance dont know thats enough get bigger one like xl possibly lll 216
better buildingbuying low end am5 box least upgrade path pcpartpicker build guide adjust fit need
agree recommending am4 here slightly modded back pocket build keep around could probably fine 7600 cost need lowered httpsukpcpartpickercomlisttpkmwy
thanks might able fine tune one bit current price think keen white case think 7600x fine shes currently running i5 3570k main reason upgrading adobe stopped supporting pc
here similar one white httpsukpcpartpickercomlistpndwfd sure play around parametrics shop around
xmas time lol much canwill change
itll depend 3070 youre going get something like msi ventus would likely fit case size wouldnt count large card unless able remove drive bay could worth looking open case airflow
choose part closer time little point choosing
wouldnt worry picking part youre full year away building wait youre able build look dealsbundles see whats available
itd pc he getting part going air force
would zotac twinedge card fit
dont know dimension case since atx zotac doesnt extend beyond atx motherboard fit fine
look like solid machine dont think regret fyi change region pcpartpicker germany comparison shopping part ive seen mixed review well pcpp reflects pricing nonus country worth playing around
o free bro
jeah know left thinking easier people look sadly least atm arent great deal lot stuff really expensive
overall picture know limitied free thanks notice
assuming youre playing least 1440p gpu bottleneck large majority time 12900k 9900x would perform similarly reason 12900k doesnt double amount thread core core pcores performance core two thread per core ecores efficiency core one thread per core would still go 9900x though since consumes less power platform receive least one generation cpu future
gaming would still recommend going am5 7700x 9700x plenty 7600x3d would also good alternative arent thread always 2x multiple core 12900x 16 24 normally yes intel changed architecture performance efficiency core efficiency core dont multithreading 8 p core 2 8 e core 24 latest generation core ultra doesnt multithreading
using pc anything gaming
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19html efficiency core 12900k dont anything gaming plus beyond 8 performance core there littleno benefit sometimes even detrimental due ccdchiplet design am5 cpu
kind workstation task used 7900x workstationgaming pc originally found great dont see 9900x issue
9900x slightly faster single core matter gaming youre budget grab 12900k
would 12900k compare 9900x gaming pretty well 12900k beat 9900x difference evaporates 1440p 4k display resolution intel x2 core thread intel us performance economy core p core symmetric multi threading smt x2 thread capable e core smt amd ryzen single type core smt
want find person started bottlenecking hysteria beat death wet spaghetti 12900k o still 100 relevant need replaced ffs
yeah 1440p im gaming say platform supported one gen youre talking am5 supported one round cpu correct benefit would able upgrade cpu one gen requiring new motherboard somewhat subscribe upgrade philosophy build new system entirely 56 year future proofing isnt huge concern mine thanks bunch detailed response
thanks reply breakdown p core e core included original post itll also workstation pc game play cpu intensive like city skyline football manager etc im leaning towards 9 7
yeah also workstation pc also play cpu intensive game like city skyline football manager cs2 intensive still cpu bound game thats im leaning towards i9ryzen 9 7
interesting gamingwise basically 8 core 16 thread
dont directly anything gaming ensure voip stream encoding youre streaming browser etc dont run pcores positive benefit gaming
ryzen chip single core type budgetapu chip laptop chip c core zen 4c zen 5c unlike intels ecores still full sized core run lower voltage clock sharing cache resource per cluster instead per core theyre analagous e core dont use mainline desktop chip
yes mean am5 supported least one generation cpu isnt something youre interested mean go 12900k
simulation game want cache 3d cache far important core workstation use depends software software benefit cache others benefit core
city skyline 1 would work better x3d cpu core us 23 core city skyline 2 benefit core count better
lot game dont 8 core
pretty much unless lot multitasking video editingrendering
yup least foreseeable future perhaps 35 year game better optimized use core unlikely well see major way year next gen console release
actually work merely theoretical im trying combative ive seen proof actually happening scheduler assigning task according core type etc afaik obschromeetc want one p core take there sort deep dive work real world usage etc id love see
almost zero workstation software benefit 3d vcache architecture far determinative prefer amd prefer intel
1000w power supply probably overkill useful dual gpu setup still thing 850w would probably enough
could get 4080 psu
fell like 7900xtx overkill 1440p would see could get 7900gre pricing good right would wait newer gpus fully launch like amd 9000 gpus launch want get 50 series card nvidia
5070ti 5080 sound good incoming tariffsscalpers dont think theyll available quite
managed fix people looking answer flashed bios older version qflash option motherboard
welcome modern processor amd ryzen chip pack lot different feature behaviour keep chip performing well even idle higher expected voltage cpu keeping one core ready high power state clearing background work ondemand ping rest cpu sleep show big spike clock speed core job spike need lot voltage ryzen master differs reporting tool youre looking since aggregate core voltage instead reporting highest value core workload like cinebench stress test cpu need distribute available power limit core cpu keeping eye thermal result average decrease voltage since clock lower across whole chip bios power management preliminary state reporting showing cpu stuck since barely anything including power management everything described safe normal expected worry
thank much little calmer thing wonder concerned youtube video seen voltage lower processor cpu core voltage sv12 tfn drop 11 09 mine show 136v min 145v due something specific board factory behavior cpu thank much responding
without knowing setup youtube video hard tell bios version window version reporting tool preinstalled application running background etc etc etc impact system manages power idle state handled would focus hard
mobo graphic card seem way expensive would cheap much psu
id highly consider x670ea variant motherboard provides similar performance come 100 cheaper 260 main difference spec would two pcie 50 expansion slot one 40 slot versus one pcie 50 40 30 expansion slot three pcie 50 m2 slot one 40 m2 slot versus two pcie 50 m2 slot two 40 m2 slot two usb typec port 10 gig one typec port 20 gig versus one usb typec port 10 gig one typec port 20 gig slight bit usb 32 gen 2 port though whether like color preference asus rog strix x670ea gaming wifi sliver white
suggestion graphic card currently pick rtx 4070 ti psu currently pick around 850w thought good range psu watt
ahhh good point definitely save money thanks
think gpu list regular 4070 worth 700 closer 550 far get depends resolution game setting want play 850watt sufficient id get something fully modular higher quality maybe httpspcpartpickercomproductphvmp6thermaltaketoughpowergf3ttpremium850w80goldcertifiedfullymodularatxpowersupplypstpd0850fnfagu4

want install 3 m2 need look x870e motherboards msi x870e carbon awesome asrock nova also great gigabyte aorus master asus x870e gaming cant go wrong either lane like high way inside computer connect gpu usb4 nvme storage everything else cpu board lane shared example gpu ssd share lane cpu essentially half rate data transferred
bought x870e tomahawk work great
im building new pc msi x870e carbon wifi expensive side tho
say going rabbit hole recently real issue people need worry gen 5 x16 gpu slot potentially cut 5 x8 5x8 gaming purpose 4 x16 even put 5090 might lose 1 fps depending title gen 5 x4 end 4 x8 essentially similar m2 nvme ssd naming place gen 5x2 essentially gen 4x4 see expensive samsung 990 pro listing say gen 5 listing box say 4x4 thats speed practically speaking people though advantage
picked gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax ice microcenter built 9800x3d build last week working great
ive eying 650 taichi lite upcoming ryzen 9000 build
first recently made build play everything 4k epic setting wellstalker2 asrock x870e nova350 currently best newest motherboard market best value long shot also hardest part get buy subscription hotstock websiteauto monitorsnotifies stock online store autobuy featurehigher tier subscription give u earlier notification get immediately canceled subscription after10month min payment still use website without making account set autobuy option amazon ipad requires device open actively running app whole time setting notification phone let buy board msrp newegg work
whatever get strongly consider updating bios recently needed one get build unlike work 40series gpu even though 40 series relatively old board manufactured summer 2024
basically asrock x870 x870e want b series get b850 fully enable pcie output chip small increase price
im rocking asus x870e hero crosshair complaint
plan two nvme drive pcie4x4 board would best limitation would fine point
u mean get sound like u already everythingi personally got similar build like u day ago bought boardasus rog strix x870ee good fucking awesomealso everything bought cheap ever past 6 month marketwith price checker im happy usually u get board first build around compatability reasonsso watch whatever u get compatable especially cpuhow u gon na cool wouldnt use stock cooler gon na bottle neck sure defeat purpose
picked msi x870e tomahawk complaint far
needed io went x870ee personally
dont need crazy overbuilt vrm went gigabyte b650 gaming ax v2 finding ram qvl wasnt hard expensive case made sure qvl didnt need m2 populated didnt really worry pcie lane honestly dont think would need wanted ps2 daskeyboard 3 nkey roll didnt need buy new keyboard
take b650 ir b850 steel legend whichever go cheaper
fine get board allows connect device people complaining pcie lane dont know talking youd enterpriselevel user saturate pcie 40 lane
msi x870e carbon wifi question dm
build b650 two month problem
thank much posting 9800x3d currently motherboardless ive seen nothing conflicting information online
3 ssds get one storage 3 combined
slot 3 populated drop gpu lane x8
b850 riptide great value great feature
bought gigabyte x870 aorus elite wifi7 atx am5 motherboard issue based read
asrock b650i lightning issue except dremel backplane axp90x47 capacitor got way
probably article review youtube video watch get quick overview choice ive also catching need help someone build iirc popular one among x870 x870 msi tomahawk x870e asrock nova prob also highest reviewed respective class
imo thing really watch supported memory speed really wanted fancy could make sure pcie 50 m2 slot addition full x16 gen 5 graphic card unless trying build small form factor pc multi booting would get pcie m2 adapter card add build call day way choose wide selection cheaper motherboards
got asus x670ea motherboard connect something every connection time work without anything changing speed slowing disabled etc 3 pcie slot 4 m2 slot 4 sata slot etc nothing share lane also support ecc ram got bios update double max supported installed memory 128 gb 256 gb
couldve got b650 steel legend wouldve ended getting b650 tomahawk complaint edit add im running 3xm2 drive 7900xtx
nvme gen 5 check lane sharing run nvme maybe 2 gen 4
3 m2 ssds need x870e board doesnt share lane asrock nova taichi lite example
crazy common belief motherboards dont matter
pretty much look asrock conclusion im sure overall theyre fine went x870e wanted usb 4 bought asrock x870e nova got msrp hard get though think one popular board msi mag tomahawk
use one pc partpicker website helpful theyll tell component compatible useful detail
pricey best high end motherboard am5 msi mpg x670e carbon wifi 20 pcie lane

there short answer question pcie lane m2 lane shared reality also huge problem per se example gamers nexus tested 5090 pcie 5 v pcie 4 v pcie 3 found barely difference let say best gpu existence barely difference ie 12 youre looking depth review motherboards would reccomend guy httpsyoutubecomlaurentschoicesirc8nrqzvyra7q4
got msi x870 p wifi mine seemed pretty decent
oredered msi mpg b650 edge wifi cause 6xsata
recently bought asrock x870 r pro cheap everything need including usb4 important complaint lane swapping perfectly okay limitation 2 nvme ssds without swapping going dont need second pcie etc check review httpswwwyoutubecomwatchveqjsegd8mhmabchannelavronahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchveqjsegd8mhmabchannelavrona
internet decided motherboards divert 8 16 pcie lane gpu purpose like m2 drive bad could bottleneck gpu many case though good thing amd really doesnt provide enough pcie lane cutting gpus lane half virtually performance penalty less powerful gpu less effect 4090 take low single digit performance hit 8 opposed 16 pcie 40 lane maybe 4080 measurable difference know minimal 4090 less significant 4080 also likely nonissue pcie 50 card 8 lane 50 equivalent 16 lane 40 jayztwocents video 5090 httpsyoutubewwfjogzmrtosiz7uwhbnzajyiov remember though support pcie 50 put card strix b650ee filled m2 slot 8 lane go gpu would running equivalent 40 x 16 40 series card would running equivalent 30 x 16 actually 40 x 8 effectively point look little difference make limit nvidias flagship 30 x 16 know less expensive motherboard less likely pcie switch graphic lane think issue buy cheaper motherboard rest assured 16 lane hardwired graphic card try asrock b850 proa pro r avoid x870 probably use thunderbolt automatically lose 4 lane equivalent m2 thunderbolt aka usb4 controller want stick strix there always b650ef
gigabyte x870 elite ice
sorry borrow post dont really understand lane sharing 16x 8x implication asus b650e wifi good go newer b850 msi brand better 9800x3d 5080 2x nvme m2 gon na anything crazy
im rockring aorus x870e pro ice 9800x3d problem hand im building new pc every 10 year like future proof self httpsimgurcomagqv4yhj
asus x870 ee gaming bios update run flawless
aorus elite ax ice b650 good bad didnt even research lane sharing lol
got asrock b650 pg lightning 40 sale microcenter updated bios pcie5 im convinced want 50 card yet currently running 3060ti doesnt seem make significant difference review
here three question ask selecting chipset need extra pci slot something addition gpu need use 2x m2 drive want overclock significant degree answer question get b650b850 need extra pci slot use many m2 drive might need x670x870 really want push overlock might need x870e
built recently 9800x3d asrock b650 pg lightning need flash bios need usb stick old gen cpu work like charm
bought msi pro b650a plan get 7800x3d 9800x3d id love go 9800x3d dont know board strong enough

am5 chipsets seem limited number pcie lane available various port tradeoff seem get pcie50 x16 slot several m2 pcie50 time x16 slot downgraded x8 certain m2 slot used get pcie50 x16 slot several slower m2 pcie40 slot lane sharing think pcie40 slower slot go chipset bandwidth shared everything else going chipset unlikely problem unless youre really pushing limit
youre sure need extra pcie lane dont need extra pcie lane
asus b650ee fine setup despite people say 4080 super run full pcle 40 x16 speed youll enough lane m2 drive make sure put fastest ssd top slot want absolutely sure extra cash x670e board offer pcle 50 lane probably overkill people
avoid asus would go asrock right value feature
4080s 9800x3d cant afford high end motherboard x670e x870e lane
avoid gigabyte lineup shared pcie lane think x870 tomahawk doesnt share gpu pcie lane m2 slot used search msi website find specific model interested look manual reference
b850 650 would work mother board isnt important gaming gpu cpu
get b650 dont care pcie 50 need am5 board x870 want pcie 50 without worrying lane sharing b650e thing wouldnt recommend anything asus thats cause bios hardware always weird
wtf lane mentioned built last pc 2011 yes still running need build new one due win 10 sunsetting never heard lane
enjoy sub top reply idiot nothing question like one going chef sub asking recipe top reply would like food
doesnt cpu decide many lane
asus rog crosshair x670e gene
brother get fastest cpu planet clue pcie lane
im rocking asrock b650 none steel legend complaint either yes ive got pcie 5 support gpu ssd 1
went asrock nova due five m2 slot complaint far granted ive system built week far lol
literally doesnt answer op asking know 0 clue pcie lane christ
got asrock b850 r pro 9700x3d problem far didnt even need flash bios
rock asrock night long
good choice mobo good hard find stock
yeah x870e nova probably mvp mainboard gen though gigabyte make reasonable fallback
asrock x870e nova 400 though avoid lane sharing compared say b650 tomahawk
dose debug led like hero carbon etc ram ocexpo dose seem one better option boreds wish would 3 slot x16 slot make bottomto x16 x8x8 shared idk along someother easy life oc thing like led display bottons board io shield see backplate common etc
dont need x870 literally expensive feature set avoid lane sharing
dam bro put work gaming spreadsheet spreadsheet work im getting paid lol
got asus b650m prime computer melt
im stuck livemixer riptide livemixer bit cheaper norway
hey glad hear picked v2 version board 7600x wanted room future upgrade
x670e tomahawk shared lane 4th m2 slot 4th pci slot
x870 tomahawk lane sharing primary gpu pcie slot directly spec sheet usb 40gbps typec port back panel m22 slot share pcie 50 x4 bandwidth run pcie 50 x2 device installed m22 slot switch m22 pcie 50 x4 bios disable usb 40gbps typec port usb4 host controller support pcie 40 x4 pcie3 slot run x2 speed installing device m23 slot switch pcie3 slot x4 bios disable m23 slot tldr using 2nd m2 slot cut bandwidth usb c port back 20 gbps using 3rd m2 slot cut bandwidth last pcie slot half using two m2 drive use slot m2 slot 1 4 prevent lane sharing splitting however personally neither 2 split problem using four m2 fine source board researched extensively buying
put 3 m2 ssds problem without cutting speed
dont like acid color printing b650 tomahawk favorite looking am5 motherboard simple nice shade black
one m2 drive share lane rear usb 40 itll operate 50x2 unless disable usb 40 port bios another m2 always 40x2 50x2 40x2 always x4 great board run one workstation lane sharing op likely wont care
also x870e variant came
x870e normal one still lane sharing slow speed use 40 m2 50 fine speed even 2x enough yes use 50 drive normal x870 also fine
correct lane switched m22 usb4 controller either get 4 lane disabled split 2 lane m23 pcie3 similar arrangement except m23 cant get 4 lane 4 pcie3 m23 disabled 2 2 am5 really doesnt enough pcie lane modern platform course amd also requires usb4 controller x870 take 4 lane wont find decently featured x870 board doesnt switched pcie lane board like x870 tomahawk wont plain simple
usb4 port share bandwidth m22 5x4 run 5x2 m22 occupied x2 mode m22 set x4 bios usb4 port fully disabled m22 also disabled phoenix 2 cpu pcie3 4x4 share bandwidth m23 4x2 run 4x2 m23 occupied x2 mode pcie3 set x4 bios fully disable m23 source httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1nqhkdecgdpm34mns3c93k6sjobnuax9oy6hv8spseditgid755628141gid755628141httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1nqhkdecgdpm34mns3c93k6sjobnuax9oy6hv8spseditgid755628141gid755628141
thats mobo plan build pc unfortunately seems stock everywhere spain since day ago still stock time nvidia release gpus know price amd ill get x870 pro r seems mostly mobo usb4 dont even need 50 expensive
great spreadsheet info must google sheet dummy formatting bad hard read especially lot text vertical even horizontal lot text formatted right cell instead left
seems nova useful tachi unless wantneed bclk built dac
one recommend
mean b850 dont get something without 50
got wifi 7 version pretty excited put together
got board 9800x3d really happy well gigabyte b850 return cpu pcie slot close together gpu 1080 would touch noctua d15
give link info realtek lan issue x870 board
agreed got board unless want use multiple pcie device heavy overclocking use 3 m2 slot really dont need anything
want point complex something op care say op get motherboard pcie gen 5 x16 say pcie 4 gpu also say use one m2 port share bandwidth main x16 slot main x16 slot bumped x8 pcie gen 5 x8 bandwidth pcie gen 4 x16 big deal right well since ops graphic card gen 4 card slot pcie gen 5 mean nothing gpu essentially pcie gen 4 x8 connection fast pcie gen 3 x16 connection still big deal something people aware understand know theyre getting 1 3 difference isnt anything concerned true reversed pcie gen 4 motherboard pcie gen 5 gpu

watched video today
40 series card run pcie 40 x 8 case 50 x8
ive seen people suggesting avoid gigabyte asus motherboards whats issue curiosity
wtf didnt say anything able afford one need guidance one pick
x870e doesnt lane x870 extra chipset share lane device number lane cpu
x870 board lane sharing gpu pcie 5 twice bandwidth pcie 4 meaning run half speed without losing performance hence lane sharing edit isnt widely understood consumer yet hence downvotes
dont worry dont need use ssd slot
idc ssd speed honeslty want max speed gpu
x870 none tends lane sharing sata port secondary pcie slot
okay well care gpu getting full speed
pcie lane better start reading pcie lane sharing gigabyte x870 board
motherboard manufacturer chooses lane wired pcie 5 board wanted pcie 5 m2 slot one slot share lane gpu slot lane gpu get 16 lane unless certain m2 filled case get 8 lane 8 used m2 instead board gpu mean top pcie slot doesnt share lane anything else board manufacturer also chooses lane come cpu chipset except top pcie slot always use cpu lane since thats defacto gpu slot
got x870 steel legend board specifically m2drives dont take gpu lane working like champ
seconding running fantastic far
dont go beta bios 100
build well ended finding nova msrp installing 9800x3d get mb like asrock bios ive never owned mb asus msi go lane reason well
building mobocpu combo weekend flash bios beforehand
seems like best value board oc normal use
nova bios switch debugging led along display msi carbon an asus hero debug led well seem nice sure really dual bios
got x870 pro r also working fine
true newegg seems getting constant stock recently got mine need get app tell stock jump
got 300 rebate 350 normal price idk tomahawk nova nothing share lane gpu 5th m2 drive disable bottom pci slot
yeahhh could buy big as ssd price
yes seems good far
lol
seems like live mixer steel legend specced think mixer slightly better third pcie audio chip actually ordered cancelled picked riptide really came color scheme end within 5 prefer black build
7600x fine cpu good many year come
overclock 9800x3d memory x670e tomahawk bought 7800x3d bundle month ago didnt even consider ability overclock new gen stuff
got x670e tomahawk 9800x3d found board compatibility issue 4k pcie capture card card wont detected installed x4 slot
way
downside using slot 4 2 4 faster 2
yep though apparently second m2 slot second fastest gen 5
usb lane sharing doesnt matter 99 people good use case usb need two 40gbsecond device even sharing get max speed one usb4 device
people hugely overrestimate big difference lane sharing make mostly game pcie 5 board difference x16 x8 lane 01 matter storage go
u cant m22 cut usb 40 gig port half disable want full speed m2 m23 take pcie slot expansion slot equipped m24 isnt pcie 5
problem
drive pcie 4 3
want 3 nvme drive x4 speed need disable rear usb 40 port bios otherwise itll run 50x2 4th slot always run 40x2
m23 limited pcie 40 x2 youll want avoid slot m22 support 4 lane use 4 youll disable usb 4 controller id use samsung 990 evo plus support pcie 50 x2 performs like highend gen 4 drive slot want keep usb4 support caveat m21 m24 9800x3d motherboard choice crazy complicated yes
valid reason every single one device going full speed simultaneously paid speed waaah
literally released hopefully youll see stock soon
reading mobile chance look fine desktop
hell yeah new build past holiday season 9800x3d asrock x870 riptide gskill royal trident 32gb ddr56000cl28 radeon 6800 happy new build everything worked straight box run great ive building pc since 90 first time didnt go air cooler went aio instead really like clean open make build look

yes right point ill look b650m pro r example report back edit b650m pro r pcie lane cpu provide enough bandwidth 1 gen 4 x16 gpu 1 gen 5 x4 ssd remaining coming chipset
confirm x870e populated m2 slot gen 5 pcie x16 running x8 gpu show gen 4 x8 gpuz tell difference whatever
would recommend x870 chipset without e specifically msi mag x870 tomahawk wifi nice balance future proof cost example wont need pcie 50 slot 4080 super know may upgrade couple year line might nice 50 new graphic card whether going actually utilizing higher bandwidth another story msi motherboard primary m2 slot cpu first pci slot even use m2 cooler upgrade one later fit reasonable cooler first 2 m2 slot pcie 50 2 pcie 40 note 3rd pcie slot 3rd m2 slot share pcie lane install m2 pcie slot bandwidth reduced usually problem unless sort extension card network m2 expansion whatever anyway upgrade pcie 50 m2 boot device continue using old one data drive convenient local backup drive move bottom slot youll 4 m2 drive support 6000 mt ram generally recommend overclock ram beyond cpu speced 9800x3d speced ddr5 5600 overly cautious given ramcpu issue distant past gaming generally mean negligible loss frame benefit staying within spec power limit info httpsusmsicommotherboardmagx870tomahawkwifi make sure click specification research make sure work
ah yes correct even though still enough pcie anything 4090
people say avoid gigabyte
asus think rma everything honor duty fix problem
sorry didnt mean say gigabyte lol sorry typed way fast
chipset lane lane overall sure trying say
looking overclock asrock b850 ripetide might looking anything would work like said motherboard less important gaming speed cpu gpu make sure ram latency cl 30 want maximize speed using nvme instead ssd memory read speed gen 4 nvme 3 4 time faster ssd drive
b650 non e fine since 4080 super pcie 40
thats buy x370 taichi wont give 600 x870 taichi ahah
going x870 dont overclock wise choice im talking automatic oc bios dont wan na custom oc b650 card enough x870 mb share second m2 slot first pcie slot 3rd m2 slot sharing second pcie slot didnt look iteration x870 mb tho
mind ask bios using mine shipped 308 know fine use long nothing wrong experienced odd thing keyboard wake sleep powering keyboard mean need new keyboard anyway looking recent bios seems add stuff related 9800x3d series
put together week ago x870 steel legend 9800x3d 4080 super working perfectly issue
noted havent really touched bios yet enabling xmp profile ram
definitely different lol previous board asus well still learning everything much hated armory crate nice tool make sure driver etc date far sure asrock similar tool could wrong complaint extremely nit picky pretty much obsessed rog strix color scheme previous build havent able quite duplicate asrock currently rocking custom beach theme created ha
nope good go
debug led display cmos clear button bios flashback tho
nice know im america already running steel legend
exactly got mine couple day ago
ah ok got board sway pci slot m2 slow second gpu slot
led postcode
glad hear thanks reassurance im lucky enough close micro center price seems like great deal spec
yes board youre able previous poster said thing shared last slot filled 2nd gpu lane unless plan run dual gpus 2025 wont notice difference even use sound card something second gpu lane x4 youll able use edit 670e tomahawk 1 slot gen 5 rest 4 board different thing check board
didnt even consider ability overclock new gen stuff definitely oc 9800x3d dunno much difference make believe optimization 9000 series flash newest bios
overclocking x3d tricky impossible may work find stable overclock suitable ram ive read overclock ceiling bit lower non x3d cpu
slot 2 default pcie 50 x2 mode using m2 drive slot 2 make rear usb c port run 20 gb instead 40 gb disable rear 40 gb usb c port completely bios run pcie 50 x4 mode far know consumer pcie 50 4x drive market today surely point exist slot 4 pcie 40 4x work samsung 990 pro use slot along another slot 1 slot 1 pcie 50 4x doesnt bifurcate 990 pro pcie 40 drive anyways
however personally neither 2 split problem using four m2 fine swear anyone fucking read comment replying
pcie gen 50 wont matter 4080 point stand difference small
read answer believe sharing lane m22 usb4 controller reasonable solution problem unnecessarily created amd
4
never mind install brave maybe something extension look fine firefox
known cause fix really
similar problem reverse actually haha recently upgraded ryzen 9 9900x kinda disappointed motherboard market kinda felt op finally settled gigabyte x870e aorus pro 350 seemed pretty hefty feature much expensive board 2 lower pcie slot dedicated gen 4 x4 gen 3 x4 golden egg frequently use pcie card didnt want gpu getting less 16x could manage look old dual socket xeon server board 2013 lad got like 50 pcie lane hahah
ram issue avoided
think asus significantly worse value compared competitor low end product really bad way competitor match term badness
workload run high data rate several device downstream hub wont able use full bandwidth hubtodevice link hubtoprocessor link become bottleneck shouldnt affect game entire game installed one ssd basegame data file one drive mod different drive might possible construct configuration notice difference
chipset lane lane overall sure trying say chipset 4 pcie4 lane cpu chipset translates call device attached cpu call 4 lane somehow attached 1000 device chipset still would 4 lane 870e second chipset talk first chipset talk cpu first chipset talk cpu stead still 4 pcie4 lane
typing x370 taichi zen 3 cpu asrock customer life accidentally released zen 3 beta bios despite amd trying pull intel
several time seen people post nice spreadsheet break lane sharing well detail various motherboards helped make choice ended x870 steel legend know beyond need right hadnt bought motherboard 8 year wanted go ahead least get latest thing probably wont build anything new long
yea im asus rn new mb get also didnt mind armory crate much barely opened usually check driver update might know gotten id double check window update decide install wait window update version usually lan controller update research similar driver app called app shop people recommend downloading website instead
bios switch dual bios
youre spending money second gpu probably looking higher end board b650 tomahawk asrock board seem much favorable lane sharing limitation though b650e steel legend taichi lite awesome regard got taichi lite open box new egg price steel legend msrp keep eye open thing like definitely save build without skimping part
know whats really unfair 7600x3d exclusive germany dont know order country httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophpamdryzen57600x3d6x410ghzsoam5wof1574788html
unless plan run dual gpus 2025 wont notice difference even use sound card something second gpu lane x4 youll able use id argue reason run dual gpus big rendering machine want render card doesnt run display render two card case slower pci lane shouldnt impact performance enough care
exact drive putting slot 4 give best overall performance without sacrificing pci lane
using m22 doesnt cut usb4 bandwidth 20gbs reduces pcie link controller pcie 40 x2 effectively reducing max usb4 transfer 40gbs 32gbs keep mind intels discrete 40gb thunderboltusb4 controller us pcie 30 x 4 link also limit transfer 32gbs nobody problem asmedia introduced controller pcie 40 support m2 slot youll want samsung 990 evo plus thought gen 4 drive also support 50 x2 making ideal drive slot performs competitively premium gen 4 drive 4tb version drive attractively priced 250
thats actually unlikely whether 10 device chipset 1 long device faster chipset wont notice difference notice slowdown copying file one disk attached chipset since share lane common video editing
yeah bought asrock doubt trust earned respect quality 8 year running
yeah thats ive everything working great far posted first time issue temp 9800 havent crazy either seeing load temp 6070 custom loop
knowledge could wrong
oh wow x3d mc 120 ive heard great id rather spend money part
sli even stable enough nowadays warrant dual gpu setup thought basically abandoned
read comment
skipped evo drive samsung removed dram cache first time history evo type ssds cost cutting measure part
put samsung slot 2
notice slowdown copying file one disk attached chipset since share lane common video editing said workload run high data rate several device downstream hub
think pick 7600x3d later year finish build rx 7800 xt play pc stuff like arma squad budget 3d cpu great help performance
far im aware sli isnt even thing anymore softwarebased task assignment output rendering doesnt need care sli though apparently second gpu even used offload overhead using lossless scaling app saw article todayhttpswwwtomshardwarecomvideogamespcgamingoffloadinglosslessscalingframegentosecondarygpueliminatesoverhead seems like would probably pretty goofy second gpu though
rendering doesnt need sli used example afaik sli discontinued
using two m2 drive use slot m2 slot 1 4 prevent lane sharing splitting however personally neither 2 split problem using four m2 fine initial comment mentioned 2 990pro one slot 1 obviously slot 4 would give performance penalty see correctly
direction industry going pro series mlc 980 pro switched tlc performance 990 evo plus good better best gen 4 drive dram desktop workload unless constantly writing drive using application doesnt support hmb like ps5 great choice
basegame data file one drive mod different drive might possible construct configuration notice difference really much thing itd perform single drive use case game dont put enough stress nvme noticable
awesome right im using rx580 graphic card seem stock around right going see new card coming soon im mainly sim racing play bunch different game first build coming console gaming
sorry wasnt clear using two m2 drive use m2 slot 1 4 prevent lane sharing splitting mean use slot 1 slot 4 lane splitting happening slot best use first keep mind slot 1 4x pcie 50 slot 4 4x pcie 40 probably doesnt matter yet arent really many pcie 50 drive use today
didnt seem like great choice 990 pro performs better practically every metric available price place evo seems score win power efficiency slightly newer controller
thats didnt make stronger claim might possible
okay thx got right dont forget youre talking bunch mouth breathing ape regularly forget plastik cooler break tempered glass side panel include misread x670e ironically looked slot 4 sharing bandwith pcie 4
well yeah 990 pro win evo keep pace gen 4 drive 4tb good value 1 2 tb capacity close price pro
ahh ok yeah sorry comment specifically msi x870 tomahawk board pretty annoying generally different board vendor lane splitting different way mean nice choice reaalllyyyy make cumbersome average user figure manually research individual board want buy already
load see performs gaming x3d cpu desirable
thank try
configuration enable freesync monitor onscreen control suddenly work gsync control panel try
notice without gsyncfreesync
9900k best processor use current motherboard unlikely benefit much consider upgrading cpu motherboard maybe memory well something current
worth buying used nothing really come close price performance wise
3080ti would massive upgrade depends resolution running determine worth
right 1080 im looking buy 27 1440p soon upgrade gpu
3080ti perfect 1440p overkill 1080p keep mind new 5000 series coming soon get bang buck wait couple month
doubt therell better value offering month 50 series gpus going available msrp probably even close seeing theyre barely faster 40 series anyway much going change 400 3080 ti would close top tpu performance per dollar chart httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx5090astral34html
probably true regret getting 3080ti right 4080 came pay 1200 though haha im interested see price 5060 compare
found ebay goldmine run 50 release 408090s xtxs available great price due owner feeling need upgrade managed nab 4080 cheapest ive seen anywhere
ive never bought gpu ebay experience defective gpus ive rma gpu option quite nice
ive bought lot component gpu far interaction great fan ordered didnt enough postage pay extra extra refunded back seller really accommodating interaction collected one factor deal good didnt list delivery selling gpu someone claiming sent water bottle screwing ebay often side buyer ran couple benchmark even showed registered guarantee 2 year remaining whilst transferable get impression issue contacted would claim behalf general rule want picture show board pin power connector minimum bit step dark said ebays buyer protection really strong think ordering working gpu receive working gpu
gpu easiest 5070ti next month
quite low budget reason need replaced
well longer us laptop schoolwork play minecraftroblox server discord usually music playing well want upgrade
low budget tbh ryzen 8500g quite bad cpu plan pair gpu future ideal pick ram also bad one stick ideal sweetspot 6000mhz cl30 case seems closed box without air intake psu less quality one
8600g selected 8500g know budget low could set used am4 system specifically want able upgrade future am4 dead new cpu either way 8600gs onboard graphic going destroy whatever laptop isnt ideal adding gpu later work something could swap future single stick ram mainly ability add another 16gb stick later 4 stick ram cause issue general consensus 2 stick better 4 case threw case would picking budget case cooling important looking corsair cx750 didnt much digging power supply since low power pc start power draw settrip case fan 150w range absolute peak yes know better part yes know budget small im asking suggestion im sure option something like 7600x would better choice even without integrated graphic thats change made
perhaps help bit would pick least 2x16gb ram 6000mhz cl30 quality psu budget cpu cooler would hurt
intending getting monitor keyboard mouse im really opposed pitching bit computer im trying fit budget set
am5 little reason use ddr56000 cl30 memory yes 7500f enough general gaming relative budget
ive managed i52500k since 2013 upgraded ssd gtx 1060 3gb ram guess id manage 7500f better go corsair vengeance ddr5 6000 mhz 32 gt cl40 80 used wondering future proofing would sense make go powerful cpu see ill manage get new one 5 year
future proofing spending spend even later unless getting x3d cpu isnt much advantage better am5 cpu unless want core even gaming performance isnt much different simply put want ddr56000 cl30 possible cl40 wont lose much performance though
experience ddr5 4800 mhz finicky term motherboard compatibility return 6000 mhz kit bought common respected brand buy 4800 mhz kit found manufacturer compatibility list wouldnt really sweat difference much
unless youve knocked something loose changing sure youve placed fan correct way
take actual benchmark memory doesnt count
placed back exact way front three fan intake aswell 2 140s top aio rear exhaust temp still low utilization im sure couldve knocked loose anything
mightve tapped 4th stick ram would tap drop frame like ill try test game tonight
dont remember fully ive never ran benchmark cod horizon zero dawn never saved unfortunately
clear youve placed fan correct orientation actually push air case front cause issue like happen cpu isnt getting good enough cooling temp still seem ok cpu still thermal throttle giving performance drop
run one switch hardware back run rocket science
yes lined arrow triple checked wind direction panel cpu temp stick around 56
tried minecraft shaders im getting 150180fps used get 240
alright issue seems unrelated last time played cw
run actual benchmark real benchmarking tool say
played last night bouncing 160180fps
usually play gunfight theyre smaller map couldve sworn fps around 200230
tried minecraft shaders getting 140170fps used get 240fps
dont real benchmarking tool whats recommended one
ran horizon zero dawn benchmark avg fps 159 max 300 min 69
put old fan back marginal difference avg 160 max 309 min 72
playing cod old fan getting 190210fpa
think could power draw related know im running smaller side psu 650w
use real tool
think psychosomatic related
used horizon zero dawn benchmark
psychosomatic mean lol
mean head
look pretty good solid build might save couple less fancy ram kit 7600 instead 7600x really worth cooler like work would get whatever psu sale moment 750850w range 650w cost much comparatively
seems solid guess really depends country u microcenter near might able get good deal cpumbram bundle usa canada australia europe recommend finding similar part pcpartpicker compare pricing availability perfect good tool alternatively look build sticky rbuildapcforme build list based parametrics selects cheapest albeit always best part available database
would 650w also work case find discount one
yeah 650 plenty restrictive want upgrade later personally dont even look psus 1000w get top tier 1000w 139 tf would pay 99109 750w
model psu typically buy brand
go psu tier list hwbusterscybenetics psu database check whats sale example right get fantastic fsp hydro g 1000w 139 amazon vita gm 134 yeah buck use next 58 year anything cost 5060 generally home fire hazard wont trust hardware like buying sport car putting styrofoam tire
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d19html absolutely bottleneck average 5080 close enough 4090 use benchmark estimate slower still
always depends game would bottleneck general would say add another 16gb ram potentially 5700x3d would worth upgrading get good price want put money am4 honestly point would save am5 upgrade know youll great gpu larger platform upgrade later
eh let window thing giving enough memory dont come close limit need
thats memory work would beneficial
work youre describing issue process take much memory need memory occupied isnt bit slower
definetly see logic behind could say technically virtual machine similar thing allocate chunk memory use said real advantage approach personally see maybe slightly improved security
might able adjust memory usage application application support example rendering software let set memory usage java programming language let suggest much ram use like people said let window thing
thats im gon na end curiosity always get better call random shower thought lol
memory accessed would prevent possibility curiosity knowledge
memory still cheap get 3264gb download httpsdownloadmoreramcom
think drove thought random microsoft background process occasion max ram usage reason never last long cause really bad stuttering
would geared toward limitation maximum usage correct
get ive tried similar thing like using 2 gpus dividing task etc always way work way complicated seems doesnt end working way wantexpect
memory fast temporary storage used cpu pool usable space cpu us temporarily store retrieve data currently using segmenting assigning memory specific task nothing cpu still going place data pc already organizing said data memory anything trying intervene would make situation less ideal memory doesnt run separately begin im assuming youre missing
joke right way creating vram desktop
yeah thats interesting solution memory leak problem anyway thats normal lol probably memory leak shouldve fixed update though window giga debloated guess never issue even though saw many people
yeah thats right
work little benefit always rub little salt wound lol ya never know try first pc ive built since window xp day surprised much easier even though hardware complicated
could theory separated multiple pool temporary storage though achieve said task pool accessed depending program process running get may inefficient current process arent programmeddesigned hell itd probably murder cpu doubling task performed
100y joke
ive experienced laptop desktop think might need find good debloat guide remove unecessary process microsoft update cause problem fix seems
yeah fun play even doesnt go anywhere lol fwiw want optimize streaming second dedicated pc recordingencoding way go dont know insouts thats pro
literally already cominggoing place regardless arent helping cpu organizing information like im helping save time organize possession simply doesnt make sense arent anything already going store whatever data need run whatever program trying run arent saving time creating efficiency since nothing done differently already give table put belonging doesnt matter put stuff table ability access table doesnt change time take walk table regardless stuff said table organized thing matter table large enough possession called capacity
lol may late party least got invited
ive considering capture card purpose lose much 1520 fps running ob gpu heavy game like helldivers 2 max setting anyway im obsessed graphic appreciate advice ill look
gotcha thanks reply ill digging fundamental ram sound like answer probably fundamental process ram accessed
hi would try reseating ram cpu make sure properly inserted sometimes ram look like fully seated slightly sticking shouldnt bios issue mobo support cpu bios issue always bios flash downloading updated bios empty flash drive pressing bios flash button sure read upwatch video process proceeding regard cooler important plugged sometimes cause system boot doesnt detect cooler would personally put cooler keep safe long plugged boot shouldnt cause issue hope help
got done using thumb drive update bios made difference guess ill take everything apart tonight
basically want spend 18002200 10001100 card different league really comparable
personally 7900xtx day cant justify paying much money gpu buy 4090 want best gpu available concern money get 5090
4080 super obviously 4090 great around 25 raw performance even considering rt amount vram better upscaling price ridiculous
2 definitely 7900 xtx 4090 worth double cost especially 5000s releasing
personally would go amd cause would want spend much money gpu
sure available easy get even price country 5070 supposed similar 4090 cost around 550 600 usd getting even u probably difficult launch though would better wasting almost 2 grand 4090
79 like 4080 also like rt monitor 4k 1440 4k definitely 4090 1440 79 fine case would wait 5080 probably
4090 overpriced according nvidia 550 said yeah go 7900xtx best price performance
monitor matter gpu past certain point 7900xtxmonitor
bought 7900 xtx 1220 canada stock 4000 series drying 4070 super pricing remaining 4000 series lunch announced pricing 5090 50880 canada also want pay incoming trump tariff
xtx monitor much better option end day quality matter 20 extra frame
4090 significantly faster there contest
good point 4080 super 1500
difference would pick 4080 used dlss really really want also want great rt performance really care reducing heat power consumption 4080 efficient xtx great card one 500 doesnt make sense unless heavily care rt dlss may offer compromise 4070 ti super typically cheaper xtx decent bit 1015 weaker general 16gb vram dlss support significantly better rt performance really care nvidia goody dont really want spend lot money card may good alternative
never nvidia card dont know want rt badly plus get 7900xtx buy great monitor aswell money left buy 4090 tho save good monitor 4k montior
fuck dlss shit id rather save 400 get oled monitor instead dlss run game 1080p upscaled 1440p idk hell would anyone right mind pay 400 extra dlss lose 20 performance 8gb go get shitty dlss 4080 cost 1500 4070 ti super would cost xtx
highly recommend great monitor upgraded oled day ago found outlet oled website 460 complete gamechanger whole new experience highly recommend
dude get xtx nvidia fanboys dride dlss absolutely worth 400 rather get oled monitor price difference
24 gb useless speak xtx owner rust use around 135 14 gb rn game higher vram usage may change implement global render even amount people buying 24 gb card rust surely extremely low
thats exactly point youre spending 1k card youd want futureproof possible game already available using 1214gb wont take much time reach 16gb mark specially 4k extra vram would handy dlss future f

long youre using gaming 1440p fine
youre planning upgrade gpu soon aswell get 1440p youre planning keep 1060 year get 1080p monitor
thank card minimum
thank plan stay card 2 3 year
gaming 1440p
yes
depends game generally accepted answer recent aaa title rtx 4070 rx 7800xt
thank advice
personally would go 4070 ti super 4k capable card standard run demanding game high setting dlss 16gb vram obvious advantage 2 early benchmark show thats million mile away 5070ti though time tell true 1440p wise itll probably run anything worth extra money dont want worry gpu year
whichever afford 4070ti super 4070ti 4070 super would take 16gb route save till though
get expensive one afford might also want look amd gpus used market might give better performance price
pick three important game take note performance 1440p using three card game calculate performance improvement 4070 super base case apply improvement cost 4070 super see lessmore cost 4070ti 4070ti super stated take average cost calculation less higher card worth extra money well worse value 4070 super decide extra performance worth getting worse deal
id pick 4070ti 4070s 4070ti
get best 4070ti super worth long run since 16gb vram also faster 2
tough time buy gpu eh thanks
thanks commenting
thanks commenting ill definitely look
thanks advice definitely
like look fps low decide game like getting value monitor refresh rate
4070s 4070ti cost effectiveness
never easy cant afford absolute best money object decision made
4070 ti super upgrade 3080ti amazing dlss4 certain title gamechanger like instance skyrim vr use like weird shaking going line stuff object longer smooth clearer got back december 750 new bios flashed strix oc get 128 power limit run 3030mhz 2000 mem 1fps less 4080 game beat amazing value card
think got less mixed get idea basically get cost per frame gpus using game matter
yeah low matter well
yes marginal performance difference couple 13 money thing would pay extra point youre budget vram
price performance yes 4070s better ti using price gave ti cost 13 7 performance
see thats fun part decision made give damn headache everytime
yeah kinda got confused lmao thanks
gotcha helped lot
saved math stuff lol ill get 4070s price stay
daniel owen httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvldpr84dk7xqhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvldpr84dk7xq
bought 4070 ti june considering 4070s decided longevity even though currently cost effective card 4080s hundred dollar expensive diminishing return also 16gb vram still think day picking 4070 ti great middle ground great performance good longevity case would ask want spend another 70 dollar extra longevity 12gb vram might limiting factor lot sooner 16gb vram becomes limiting factor another 70 dollar worth extra year playing higher setting nice extra 4070 ti also stronger card performance ofc
bit unrelated think waiting getting new 5070 expected drop around 650 country much better 4070 series might well get one futureproof wise
hard say there availability would unwise get 5 series wait know sure manage get card first month release
thanks much man really really helped much

think got added
hard say first thought cable twisted bit much caused something fray inside causing short imagine hardware ok hard know sure try new case
get x870e mobo new 850w atx 31 psu also get 2x16 6000mhz 30cl rating
benefit x870 thunderbolt gn j2c done video pcie speed id expect x8 pcie 4 would enough also add x870 less lane x670b650 thunderbolt
wouldnt get one new b850s x870s thats still 200 dollar board get brand new one better spec 2030 buck
""
dont mind paying better product newer worth 100 dont see better spec newer board maybe im missing something
x870e mobo feature need ned psu gen 5 600w cable ram speed shouldnt exceed 2 stick
asrock b850 steel price better speced still white board thats important
8x 50 lane gpu 4x lane sata 12x lane m2 4x lane soundcard 2x lane usb 32 thats 30 lane im good b650e adding usb4 force x670ex870e count right
asrock 2 less back usbs bummer need lot lower max memspeed case matter future easier access m2 thats else better white color important
im computer research gigabyte board shared lane ive seen lot comparability issue thread sub pretty sure buildzoid wasnt thrilled lineup odd theyre brand sticking 6 layer pcb still past b650 also hub mobo roundup went tomahawk generally well reviewed memory ocs well good thermal doesnt share lane
3070ti perform like 3070ti far coolingnoise go youll google review dont build oem hardware accessible u
remember seeing review dell 3080 people pretty happy imagine 3070ti us similar exactly cooler
oem card selling cheap nice box retail warranty rgb lighting cool label
decent dell 3090 surprisingly good 3070 ti look similar 50 buck strix could worth depends important temp noise would recommend undervolting anyway 3070 ti draw lot power tuned lot efficient
cant help card specifically experience oem part often perform worse offtheshelf part often thermal throttling dell 3070 ti look similar msi twin fan 3070 nonti could look review latter get something comparison personally wouldnt bother oem part unless significantly cheaper option
cpu currently using
get 7700 7700x happy
sure check benchmark video 7800x3d 1440p game see comment saying 7800x3d play 1080p
i59400f 1660 lol
difference 7600x 7800x3d big 1080p extra 300 worth playing 1400p
get 7600x massive upgrade built system around 9700x wanted extra coreshigher clock productivity plan upgrade x3d 3ish year closer end am5 lifespan 7600x7700x9600x9700x perform within 2 gaming 1440p right around previous flagship 5800x3d still amazing today httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d19html
sound good thank overthink think im gon na make wrong decision lmaoo
look solid issue
bad build assuming gaming cpu useless get 7600x deliver exact gaming performance bit expansive ram spec cost u 30 less overpriced nvme price u get 2tb tier kinda mehhh case expansive price tag good psu worth 100 httpspcpartpickercomlistvpjrmchttpspcpartpickercomlistvpjrmc money saved start saving towards better gpu suggest picked one smallest matx case market u picked rgb puke case great case

yeah teamgroup great
gpu might worth trying boot integrated graphic assume boot drive showing bios
reset bios unplugging psu either shorting cmos pin 10 second hitting button motherboard second removing cmos battery 30 second
tried fresh install window get another boot drive test existing boot drive rule corrupt o
possible something happened boot expo file corrupted try boot install medium see reset way
long let attempt boot window cpuramboot led debug light lighting memory training am5 take first boot talking minute ten minute
recently similar issue x670e tomahawk ended replace motherboard unfortunately
try booting without gpu doesnt work try moving nvme drive different slot one motherboard may faulty imo
sorry man amd expo 7950x3d broke manually flash bios expo
bet still configuring ram take long time sometimes let sitfor 10 15 min turning
boot window time hang black screen boot eventually could memory training issue there setting bios fix im sure
yes boot drive showing bios actually already dont gpu pc yet im going try 50 series day assembled rest pc yesterday make sure everything working
unfortunately ive done 10 time bring bios reset default setting trying boot still hang black screen
dont think window issue booted window fine yesterday used pc little enabling expo get back
let run 20 minute instance earlier attempt yellow light come resetting cmos reinstalling ram made go away
hey appreciate help problem actually resolved bug enabling expo changed boot drive despite still displaying correct drive bios much troubleshooting reselected window installation drive got work
look restore memory context thing change auto enabled fresh window install may worth seeing cant boot usb install medium reinstall also update bios possible thing would try
even without enabling expo made sure trying boot base 4800mts ram speed
generally first suspect thing isnt working boot drive kind hardware ram training issue wouldnt able boot
id check boot sequence see stage boot process get past always accurate help point fails boot im sure yellow light mean particular motherboard sound strange booting anymore even resetting cmos back default
odd bug glad got fixed
yes fresh window install also updated bios yesterday beforehand im already latest version restoring memory context
yes ive hit disable expo bios well manually chosen 4800mt clock speed way boot anymore
turn wasnt window issue enabling expo led bug said c drive selected boot drive wasnt actually booting drive unselect reselect drive able get back
httpswwwredditcomramdsdzoxrivizi look thread found see may possibly help pretty old would thought updated bios would rule hey never know uh yea would personally try see even boot usb window install medium least troubleshooting reinstalling window could fix issue would eliminate headache
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
nice glad got fixed look like learned trust nothing
bios doesnt see c drive mean wasnt listed device primary boot
yes window drive first boot order actually able boot window use computer earlier since enabling expo everything got messed debug led none
yes never trusting
device c drive showing bios primary boot actually booting drive reselected primary boot worked
see youve tried either stick time tried slot worst thing think possibly hardware issue either cpu fully socketed one ram channel dead even ram issue
shouldnt buying individual stick 16 gig avoid irc would able run rated speed
id still go am5 id get 7 7500f would cheap great option although aliexpress point saving money later friend decides upgrade since wont need new mobo ram heck ram fking expensive ddr4 jump am5 wouldnt mutch expensive fpu said like max 70 buck mobo 2x16gb 6000mhz ram kit 100 buck id worry cpu lot people refdomend check reputable seller preferably marked choice around 100 buck resolution playing 1440p 6700xt would enough save later card line want decent 1440p yes often need 7700xt maybe find used deal like jawa reputable used component marketplace maybe another card
source saw dual channel ram better performance single stick also save money would nice
pricing actually wild partpicker ammended price reflect polish market pricing really dont want go aliexpress dont want risk issue shipping time etc suspect play 1080p startwith right maybe buy better monitor later 1440p wanted avoid 8gb go lower gpu
didnt explain clear buy stick ram coming pack pack two stick 2x16gb buying two pack one stick im seeing list
refresh rate friend monitor high aim 1080p 6700xt perfectly fine 1440p well obviously ultra idk anything polish market idk pricing stuff cant say much get trust aliexpress future stuff info got community stuff crap cpu cpu great buy precaution like checking seller sale pc flipper regular get 6700xt 8gb afaik 12 unless gre idk much may less belive 66006600xt 8gb one 4060 8gb one sure dont find 6700xt 6750xt slightly upgraded version came way later made expensive mutch better theyre basically price
ok good tip thanks
right 6700xt 12gb differnce 7700xt seems high benchmark
yea decently high jump look gameplay footage 6700xt handle game 1440p although newer game struggle soain live 6700xt decent amount 6750xt none available 7700xt best getsince 7600 isnt good yeah go later upgrade maybe directly am6 keep long enough
yes 212 going 20 year old spend 30ish upgrade wont regret
use 5700x3d mainly gaming 6h rendering job youre going get much upgrading cooler power efficient cpu said p much better 212 total waste money
yes tempsnoise better
definitely go p
upgraded 3600 5700x3d kept using hyper 212 temperature 3545 idle 5570 gaming 72 cinebench dont find noise noticeable gaming

compatibility issue plug gpu connect power gpu connect monitor gpu power
connected monitor gpu still booting
ask late february ill know
tariff go theyll go
literally impossible know
unlikely unfortunately new release barely affect price previous model
would wait bit longer youre worried tariff would spend bit get 4070 ti super leak 5070 ti isnt going much faster 1015 wont available month open market hopefully help
much going price day likely
id say im asking went previous occasion tend go stay
fair enough
thank im uk tariff thing shouldnt really affect dont think hold till mid feb time honesty see go
seems popular opinion probs
ive found 500 gpu tends sell around 500 mark gpu around 800 mark tends sell around 800 mark especially true february also true every month month impact gpu price performance product competitor release 500 gpu performs 50 better cause current gpu lose value
history tell u entirely unpredictable
didnt new gpu release last year
fwiw part problem advertised msrps new gpus arent really real anymore yes lucky people able buy msrp card launch day week soon initial stock exhausted new 50series card pricing ballpark 20 higher msrp make remaining stock 40series look like deal exact price theyre currently sold 40series stock finally exhausted like retailersnvidia going drop 50series pricing back msrp thats evaluation typically work
new gpus launch wont available month due scalper nice thing though new gpus launching see bunch people sell 4000 series nvidia gpus 7000 series gpus like bunch idiot cheap due fomo might able swing good bargain card soonish resolution playing game edit good tariff wont affect affect u though u haha
say last year
say im new pc gaming havent even played game yet pc pretty decent monitor 4k 144hz sure 28 ryzen 5 7600x cpu ill likely pair 7800xt heard pretty good combo 1440p resolution stuff new ive always console worry abt sort stuff monitor aoc gaming monitor
previous occasion new gpu release covid want grab crystal ball instead
since youre new thing aware first 1440p wont look good 4k monitor would 1440p monitor 4k look best 4k monitor 1440p look best 1440p monitor 1080p look best 1080p monitor good know get best resolution intend play would also aware upscaling fsr dlss ai upscaling solution better dlss fsr4 going much better fsr 3 something research know technology important gaming day example lot people use dlss quality mode 1440p play 1080p speed almost native 1440p quality sound need research understand need want system
youd like dont know gpus drop mate forte never involved gaming pc
got anymore question pc gaming feel free ask though dont mind helping new gamer
oh thanks man really appreciate ive done tonne research get pc realise lot understandknow someone help little great thanks edit also need research
seemed resolution upscaling technology think case 4k monitor might best 7900xt absolute bargain amazing performance importantly 20gb vram going great 4k gaming hear even though fsr 35 good dlss lower resolution 1440p 1080p disparity two technology much less 4k term quality could run game fsr balanced mode allow run game fast 1440p beastly 4k machine instead fsr balanced 4k look better 1440p native understanding would look much better 4k monitor thought basically setup used way would allow get 100 fps many game 4k use fsr reason bring recently got pc gaming year ago learn upscaling really huge game changer
lastly want spend little bit could thing 4070 ti super 5070 ti 16gb vram sufficient dlss 4 soon superior fsr3 course would premium pick go route would also ill stop comment sure getting bit long winded point

thats strange im sure thats even possible tbh maybe check roverclocking see idea nothing else help manually set memory speed timing
thanks time pretty fed getting help reddit day set manually
im referring sub thats anything help also use google youtube find guide
well thank lot anyway help time nice day
best luck sorry couldnt assistance
run would gen 4 slot
simply run gen4 pcie backwardsforward compatible run lowest gen involved
self destruct run fine
read file fine
understand read article said simple word performance bottleneck serious sequential readwrite speed talking abt notice bottleneck ssd readwrite workload 4k8k video editing largescale data processing use gen 4 ssd downloading playing aaa game 1440p idk drive would affected plugged gen 5 slot httpsstoredbitscomgen5ssdinagen4nvmeslottextas20we20discussed20above2c20the4020port20and20vice2dversa
yeah
none matter youre workload gaming doesnt benefit additional bandwidth anyways higher sequential speed irrelevant since game sequential workload even sata would fine gaming cpu v chipset doesnt matter bandwidth doesnt matter difference spec dont matter httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv4dkla7w9eea article putting gen5 drive gen4 slot vice versa also reference different workload race car dump truck perform differently depending workload
thx
ah ok thx
much difference cuo ryzen 7 7700 7700x go 7700x save 5060 go 7700 much difference much difference 5600mhz 6000mhz ram ddr5 sure youre asking ddr5 there significant difference two speed though 6000 mhz ideal sweet spot power supply enough 700w little probably fine put pcpartpicker add 200w wattage estimate thats much need ive never heard brand theyve got certification cybenetics plus oemd great wall probably fine dont need aio want save money dont use kingston theyve got history stealthswapping component product
1 5600 mhz slow ddr5 6000 recommended there 25 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewddr5memoryperformancescalingwithamdzen521html difference 2 never heard power supply there even review 3 7700 come cooler 7700x youre using anything serious would save money go nonx variant
thank much reply meant write ddr5 corsair ram ssd go
corsair ram thats fine pick whichever cheapest whichever think look cool ssd wd sn5000 pretty good

letter yes reality bit complicated there probably sort internal benchmark theyre trying hit thats immediately obvious instance maybe need 32 gb 60 fps time maybe 20 gb youre 60 fps 95 time 55 fps 5 time maybe company realize people tend buy specific denomination ram 2x8 2x16 etc reality need 18gb people running 3x8 reasonable suggest 2x16 aka 32gb instead
would upgrading 32 48 64
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
buy better psu
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
see lot people saying 0rpm doesnt matter youre gaming headphone thats point 0rpm mode youre gaming psu going running fan regardless pc idling im task doesnt require headphone dont want distracted psu fan going crazy
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
put way psu doesnt 0 rpm mode case 7 fan sat desk sit recording vocal mixing music dont notice picked recording good psu doesnt need 0 rpm already near silent sound like buddy bad noisy one youve tuned fan quiet moving enough air psu getting hot revving cool try raising rpm case fan little psu slows find happy medium isnt one probably noisy psu
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
yes reduces price
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
hope company never stop release psus gpus without 0rpm mode want fan last longer wear faster constant startstop bullshit pain as replace
super flower leadex vii 1300w zero rpm feature toggled onoff switch
company still sell cheaper psus lower quality part would great without airflow yes cut cost hopefully saving passed consumer another way saying buying expensive isnt buying quality overpriced crap
cant even hear psu fan running small amount airflow increase reliability
simple answer people buy
even pretty cheap psu probably doesnt go 0 rpm basically silent im playing game dont see huge reason
replaced 16 year old ultra x3 psu died one cheaper quiet psus doesnt 0rpm mode kneel beside cant tell apart cpu case fan
mine silent mode dont bother using time hear pc fan get going anyway rog thor 1000w iirc want know
ive turned every evga power supply ive owned annoying hear fan suddenly ramp settle second unit temp threshold cycle
certainly dont care dont use pc without headphone anyways
see lot tinnitus candidate thread good guy constant weeeeeeeeee hear keep company grow older
silent say 7 noctua 3000 rpm fan case controlled fan expert dont care noise play headset anyway
im worried psu lasting long
get fanless psus idea long one would last especially pushed close rated capacity
evga g5 one
people wont care doesnt answer dont psus dont extra mode less noisy like cost making bit less noisy people care
feel uncomfortable silent room computer fan good ambient noise couple minute completely tune
pc make noise
honestly psus dont like 0rpm mode good fan spin slowly still virtually inaudible keep temp inside significantly lower also part designed move dont usually break sooner moving counterpart oversized asus psu system wich course 0rpm mode wich resulted fan never spinning one day gpu upgraded pc could draw enough power psu fan spin fan spinning first time 4 year made terrible sound sound usually hear damaged bearing
1 psu one component probably need constant active cooling especially load enclosed mean take advantage airflow rest computer case 2 cheaper psus may louder costlier one moreexpensive psus higherquality fan improved bearing system may even buttonstoggles adjustcontrol fan speed 3 consumer nonserver nonworkstation psus ive used pretty darn quiet already many nearly completely silent evga supernova 750 g2httpswwwevgacomarticlesarchive00823defaultasp psu toggle button change 140mm fan quiet silent cost 99 back got 2017 even hear unless put head directly back computer evga doesnt list fan db psu zero fan noise upgrading system component november went 300w build 500w build actually changed silent setting back noisier quiet setting increase airflow ensure psu stayed cooler feel air coming still hear basically psu cost totalsilence required willing pay psu comedy option open psu disconnect fan result early psu failure even massive fire lead everyone building dying horrible death wouldnt recommend
traditionally component kind experience greatest amount damage first turned thus fan going 0rpm say 100rpm 100 time day likely fail faster one running 100rpm minimum case fan pwm powered intuitively imagine pwm motor draw highest possible current closer 0 rpm also develops power 0 rpm also generally least efficient thus fan piece experience highest torque highest power drawn highest heat generated turning 0 rpm
fix coil whine might try dead silemt pc
doesnt cut cost exclude charge include generally recommended buy bottom barrel psu fit budget thats classic firsttime builder issue
recently ran issue finally upgraded case used first ever build nice case great airflow tuned fan stay pretty much silent whenever im gaming theyll ramp heat start rising thats noticed something never noticed psu ive using since 2017 constant annoying whirring sound matter there absolutely nothing adjust fan curve doesnt bother enough buy new psu since one still powerful enough machine man annoy lol
white noise bruh brain tune unless kick jet engine speed
unlike gpus psus need airflow even idle zero rpm modeeco mode lower psu component longevity cause pc shut abruptly psu zero rpm mode made sure hotglue zero rpm switch position want zero rpm buy overbuilt psu
yeah man 14 fan system running extreme dont care sound psu auto fan run getting hot rare ambient air office ac controlled
mine ecomode switch turn fan
requires temperature probe fan control circuitry would add sizable cost scale easy corner cut
psu constantly making sound doesnt 0rpm mode im unclear ask question answered title
add cost bud
mean appreciate pc isnt distractingly loud idle never turn pc psu fan specifically fan turn truly dont care wouldnt know psu fan turned quality psu fan going pretty quiet usually larger slower nature often 140mm fan stuffed case put desk nobody going hear one fan softly spinning
amd gpu fan disabled reach certain temp hate feature disable like stuff bit cooler amd default dont mind fan loud seem minority never thought loud fan issue box quiet first jet enginethats issue especially dustclean regularly
0rpm psu go 600 rpm till get halfway rated wattage slowly ramp considering fact 850w psu tend build pc lower wattage dont think even hit 13 max wattage psu thing inaudible lifetime unless fan start break couldnt find 450500w psu build quality wanted time price liked sale price liked got
situation psu fan dead silent tbh actualy never heard psu fan dealt well hear one tick bwcausw 15 year old
tbh 0 rpm mode psu badly tuned super flower fan kick spin pretty fast going slow seasonic made audible click fan kickin used fan prefer bequiet approach fan psu supposed work always silent
get overpowerd psu pretty much never turn fan unless youre gaming especially psu en eco silent mode button
like hear noise make safe pc shit instead subconscious thought overheating purely subjective tho
thermal noise dont mind jet engine sound
counterquestion pure power 11 practically audible idle mode despite fan spinning time spin slow enough keep noise hearing threshold regular environment care lot quiet pc since music production never felt need zero rpm stuff many fan besides bad one constantly hum become next inaudible 500 rpm especially pc standing right next table
year buying pc component recent power supply bought feature bonus something searching want component cool tend get better performance longevity latest build option psu actually didnt select chose mode would run minimum speed ramp needed psu gpu far loudest component mix load psu doesnt matter nearly much think probably
multiple psus silent setting come bigger high quality heat think higher efficiency translate higher price tag short u find u r looking u r willing spend money
psu fan dont contribute much noise unless room dead silent start gaming fan would collectively noisier
give slightest crap computer make noise headphone anyway yeah like ill hear ut
people really dont care noise may kind misophonia annoy badly enough tune silent generally otherwise people tune sound similar people dont change fire alarm battery stop hearing beep
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
love loud fan pc way know working
feel need make sure hear computer something wrong little bit fan noise bad annoying
iv always maximum performance almost cost lol fan go brrrrr
yeah noise something worry especially since either something playing tv phone wear headphone becomes background noise bit anyways
yea lol built pc took like 12 year realise fan curve accidentally set 100 time
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
play game watch video
would argue matter dont air flow dust put psu large portion lifespan consumer youre usually running psu fan percentage would argue fanless psu going last significantly longer fan bearing kind thing rest wear system due build crap left since psu getting pretty dirty like 7 8 year
ok know say common experience fan kick power supply pull watt start heat say oversized 1200watt platinum evga power supply doesnt start fun even game full load system marginally get 600watt bought psu need different current set utilised benefit never kicking fan
exactly people talking like headphone solution everything well everyone us headphone watch hd movie surround sound system mine wife watch loud distracting noise coming computer would take u movie ruin experience
ill gladly take constant humming fan sporadicperiodic grindingclickinggrumblingthunking hard drive
fair opinion feel like people dont see way
loved sound floppy drive day prefer gear quiet
i5 11400 used funny sound boosting limited 99 power energy setting needed let go 100 demanding game avoid stuttering
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
like confidently wrong power supply eco mode fact looking 3 pc right eco mode fan turn psu hot enough require fan spin big enough psu get fan never spin never asked enough power heat sufficiently kick fan yes know might impact efficient sweet spot psu matter power consumption airflow always required system dissipating enough heat ksit natural convection threadripper system 3080 evga platinum 1200watt psu even gaming load doesnt kick fan doesnt even reach 50 psu rating load
installed corsair rm850x shift year ago ive never heard even run passively 30 40 load spin quietly havent heard yet buy quality model cheaper one
also fan constantly running gather much dust
pc like airplane turbine got worried overclocked thats
im well aware wouldnt psu consulted buying
impossible still get pretty quiet overspend cooling accept performance penalty recent build 4070ti r9 7900 people would say completely inaudible even full gaming load
like dog people leave tv radio
doesnt affect something must wrong classic response ive hearing pc community decade
need keep pc running background something close common area house helpful silent operation
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
game pc reliably isnt max length hdmi cable
people dont space rich person say rotate selection car course week give something look forward morning comute rich person say set secondary master bedroom side house cant sleep rich person say place pc well ventalated insulated room run hdmi cabling wall please
yup pc sits closet ran cable desk close enough mercy pita something go wrong far enough away crank everything piping hot level care im dumping heat closet couple large fan grille exhaust dining room
wasnt idea took others
pc produce little noise regular operation could easily made even quieter wished aio run needlessly high idle fan speed counter ramping noise fan make major temp fluctuation wanted could make pc even quieter due boosting behaviour 7800x3d fan actually loudest ramping higher speed chip may boost beyond 70c couple second even mundane task setting low fan speed light work would still cause random spike noise leaving reasonably low level prevents excess noise could make seperate fan curve use really needed pc quieter simply choose
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
could often tell tv turned different room apparently one knew could hear
calling high pitched screeching stretch initial high pitch whine dulled fast inaudible anything produce sound ie watching video playing game
ive definitely seen one onoff toggle switch 0rpm mode though maybe theyre talking
love confidently replied actually reading wrote never said fan wouldnt spin said active component generate heat heat might passively dissipated low power consumption 0 rpm said psu start heat start spin fan guess youve never heard pc silent winter cold room become rb211 hot day load
mean living room loud hell exterior fan way louder psu also 3 front fan rear fan loud enough even heard phone call im really sure would need completely silent considering people many thing space would loud enough drown
psu fan low basically imperceptible mean ive got bunch psus use general purpose power supply even outside pc sitting desk youd hard pressed tell without looking 6 away stuffed desktop case put way never hear
say
could run ac unit keep room cold like server room
optical hdmi cable go even 300 foot
active cable thunderbolt depends far away put use regular cable side wall linuss current method us usb fiber box probably good option ive used thunderbolt 3 great work big pain doesnt recently converted main pc vm host thunderbolt didnt want play nice plenty option usb display cable huge length
mean putting pc another room bit far cry alternating least 7 car fun enough drive looking forward commute especially consider could probably knock diy job corner window wood ducting get job done effect
wish random reddit calling rich made true far guy afford buy 6 5090s sure option everyone far rich person option course actually need another room ideally one fine add noise like everything scale base cost version time run cable another room first time parent house ran stuff basement right desk needed slightly longer cable 1015 foot pretty reasonable expense pc used spare bedroom last apartment everything literally right side wall cable run shorter normal setup rear io less foot port monitor
act like idea putting computer different room hasnt thing since inception computer one missing
well youre naming guess see call linuss idea
young hear wouldnt call screeching though white noise
im obsessed oc low temp couple year aggressuve fan curve started drive mad let component reach high 60 case feel like theyre kinda hot people daily running 80c friend mine using 1050ti 90c around 10h per day rendering gaming lasted 6 year guess got ta stop obsessed also tend overshare fucking lot coul tell lmao
thats actually great idea method allow better dedicated cooling able direct air window way making heat exchanger cool room get house want set bong cooler cool rack exchanger
going need work cabling hdmi gon na need run wall asked get hdmi cable garage living room right would proper ventalation put closet need somewhere airflow arguing telling someone isnt really problem rich person thing people cant solve solution disruptive expensive
exactly ive since linus knew kernel others hell first computer entire room
hit belt
scared 60 5060 completely normal operating temp idle like 40
look rich guy garage
id go attic crawl space run line hard hardest part making sure come bottom plate 6in wall floor
cant hear anymore either got ta grow someday
know im scared know cpu gpus perfectly fine 70c even tho electrical component deteriorate faster expected 70c really obsession like oc get around 1520 fps title compare max oc component stock honestly game already 100 fps wont make noticeable difference temp sure cooler card likely last longer said previous comment friend mine ran 1050 ti 90c 10h per day 6 year thing still alive another pc friend pc around 7 year
check power setting permission especially related update window pretty fucky

yea seller soldsent wrong item got money back via buyer protection 150 iem got everything back except tax buying keyboard mouse wont issue thing one easiest thing buy aliexpress definitely recommend another could think buying via aliexpress cpu buy 100120 performance 7600 personally would definitely get 3 thing ali nothing worry especially buyer protection edit looking around aliexpress would probably get keyboard mouse get cpu uk

go pcpartpickercom look
always build figure budget go pcpartpickercomguidehttppcpartpickercomguide pick one ask advice tweak build suit need
buy one prebuilt fit need
use ue5 im guessing know read documentation right pc building easy read manual documentation pretty difficult try approach like building lego without instruction unless youve built pc dont want spec one make list requirement go rbuildapcforme would help watch couple build vids there one ltt thats firstperson like able follow along 15x speed build prob take 26 hour depending closely follow instruction whether somebody available help answer question long spend tinkering window setting there time place prebuilts time crunch legitimate reason also rare case prebuilts cheaper corresponding diy approach dont feel bad think thats better use time
hmm gotcha ill take look thank
gotcha thanks advice
5700x3d
want future upgrade go am5 want save money stay am4 pick 5900x youre using productivity gaming
thank ill look one
thank think 5900x could last couple year
youre almost satisfied think youll fine youre really struggling current rig cant imagine youll see huge improvement 5900x unless workload heavily core constrained
itll depends quickly want
thank
fine every component pegged 100 usage realistic workload hope know youre buying mate mean there hundred extra spent stuff make zero actual difference people
thanks reply yes pc designed heavy data analysis aaa gaming recommendation advice id greatly appreciate hearing
600 board silly dont benefit board compared one thats 200 memory choice optimistic best unnecessarily expensive 6000cl30 would better even there good chance speedtimings wouldnt run advertised much memory memory made samsung hynix micron there need spend extra domintor memory massive l3 cache making even trivial already mention illogical aim borderline stability speedstiming workload prioritize stability first working large single file sustained read writes drive dont make sense waste money spend extra titanium rated psu efficiency rating directly related quality quality gold unit would fine youll never make difference energy saving compared cost difference psus
thanks different reason money isnt issue pc build however point make regarding memory choice compelling thanks type data analysis well implementing quite diverse guess versatile choice work better like 6000cl30 suggest
speaking money wasted buying gen4 nvmes heatsinks doesnt make sense motherboard heatsinks m2
didnt even notice good lookin ufoureyeraven
thank hadnt noticed either think heatsinks nvme drive would waste money could potentially cause compatibility issue
said buying gen4 nvmes heatsinks doesnt make sense motherboard heatsinks m2
mean simply waste money may cause incompatibility doesnt make sense little ambiguous
waste money wont able use heatsinks built board
depends much power rest pc draw likely fine x80s questionable 4090
4080 sure unless also using 14900k full load 4090 eh might work really tight wouldnt recommend afford 4090 afford proper psu 5080 eh ok might problematic id upgrade safe side
load example people running sf750 4090 personally wouldnt ive run 13700k 4080 super without issue even headroom ive switched 9800x3d
ever contentious psu question imo 1000w1200w avid pc gamers like swap hardware talking sfx psus 8090 series go 1000w day dont love running thing like power supply limit reasonably avoid lot 1000w psus efficient 2050 load range usually quiet loaded hard cant see bad thing space one help psu last long time check hardware buster cybenetics specific psu efficency curve etc everything general statement opinion research
5800x3d two stick ram 2 nvme like 7 140mm fan 4090 ups also synology ds916 4 drive unifi switch access point via poe 38 monitor game see 600w ups everything connected 750w plat fine even 4090 adapter 3x8 12pwr exist psu native one deliver 450w combined gpu eventually power limituv exists
also 5800x3d
4080 5080 okay 4090 pushing reference 7800x3d 3090 750w working fine though wish 850w extra clearance

isnt much gaming difference 5700x 5600x youre going 5700x3d 5600x small jump id personally upgrade x3d chip dont find jump nonx3d chip worth point price
described x3d cpu arent really option due psu budget point id change many part point might better getting whole new system doesnt run am4 question line whether upgrading 4700g 5600x 5700x would improve performancelongevity would better value investment
unsure think dont psu headroom 5700x3d 5700x use roughly power load look power consumption graph reviewhttpswwwtechspotcomreview2801amdryzen5700x3d 500w fine 3060ti low power 8 core like 5700x3d point difference current cpu one youre eyeing isnt much youre still going bottlenecked scenario youll sunk 150 new cpu itll slightly faster take one step performance staircase spent 75 5700x3d instead moving 3 4 step moved one really arent much ahead started
thanks lot elaborating make lot sense might thought lot restricted psu actually
tdp sort joke day given completely ignored motherboards run whatever feel like definitely wouldnt go similar spec intel chip would suck back way power similar performance would look bigger core count amd chip would blow power budget water gpu 200w card cpu 100w rest system giving 100w headroom stuff theoretically shouldnt really going 400w worst case mean fine 500w
yeah became apparent article linked didnt help power supply calculator tried lot pessimistic either think might scrape extra money together xd3 instead andor look deal
used 200 still shop around think ali express still saw 300 price tag pcpp laughed 200 brainer 300 much harder sell price almost moving am5 territory
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
really insist am4 5700x3d logical pick said would better go am5 unless get am4 stuff used really nice deal price
dont mix match ram module
long ram stick kind speed dont recommend mix matching ram keeping ddr4 ram would allow get affordable am4 lga1700 motherboard 5700x3d 12700k personally id suggest 7500f 7600x am5 motherboard thats budget 32gb kit ddr5
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
ideally would want spend around 300 370 much mobo ram cpu
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
6000 cl30 ddr5
am5 handle faster see board support 8400 saw 64gb kit 6500 cl28
there little point edge case less stable
next getting rtx5090 next best pc build atm b case look like fit 10 fan 1 360 aio fit 7 case c one know prob take month constantly looking stock get white card get lucky
thankyou helpful fan recommendation also see white version find inno3d geforce rtx 5080 x3 oc white know there way order pre order time soon

lol video 8 year ago crappiest heatsink imaginable could link like 100 video temp improved controller shorter nand chip samsung drive add extra pad edit youre braindead never said pry heatsink enjoy blacklist well
add im trying build gpu
say option 2 full upgrade option 1 isnt require roughly amount partswork option 2 wouldnt consider 5700x3d youre already am4 even 7600x am5 trade blow am4 x3d chip youd much ahead going route
meant going upgrading cpu necessarily full upgrade cpu gpu
okay sounded like thought could drop 12th gen chip current motherboard since theyre intel common assumption see daily sub 1440p youre probably going want gpucpu upgrade id try go 7600x biggest gpu afford
nah im upgrading cpu mobos mine currently support 9th gen dota cpu intensive game thought heavy cpu upgrade benefit fps game coding speed
would research specific game play video editing task effect different cpu gpus think easy overspend cpu get something overpowered use case without noticeable performance boost think might strategy get cheaper am5 cpu 5070 ti something effect future could upgrade cpu necessary
yeah go 32 able swap mobo
new gpu easiest swap whats wrong psu
588 good price gpu great compared current generation solid middleofthe pack gpu day run game much better gpu
know thinking upgrading gpu future however thought whatever extra cash right know would better go storage monitor think
yes could probably benefit storage 256g since mb one m2 slot would either need replace 256 bigger nvme use 256gb operating system get sata ssd game storage
thinking upgrading motherboard asus b760m d4 prime 2 m2 slot future proofing
question im sure youre looking never even told u psu

dont switch
oh bad yeah wondering psu switch brand inplay s550
called inplay s550
bought name psu guess doesnt come usual feature
temp look like enabled pbo also pretty bad ddr5 r5 7600 6000 cl30 amd expo optimal expo enabled
expo enabled idea pbo ill upgrade ram later even though already expo work 6000 mhz
expo ii enabled asus performance enchancement enabled core performance boost auto cpu core ratio auto turbo game mode enabled
without pbo enabled r5 7600 boost 38ghz base clock pbo enabled boost 51ghz big performance boost
working 51 ghz look result
pbo enabled
idea could issue
low performance game cinebench good reference gaming performance people use test thermal throttling run something like 3dmark timespy good gaming benchmark compare actual gaming performance online review test system cpugpu combo keep mind using ram high latency 30 slower optimum shouldnt expect equal result build properly optimized
ive read every description bios found solution latest bios update turbo game mode setting added bios actually utilizes pc power single core disabling 6 thread 6c 12t 6c 6t setting enabled ill leave comment future reference
thanks help ill upgrade ram future budget enough atm thanks
first would wait get 5070 soon wouldnt get 64gb ram overkill unless know need work something get 32 gb kit window key old laptop using could get window key taht save money
removed
board picked 4 slot got 32gb ram kit later added another 32gb kit would impact performance

like literally margin error would make bigger difference game dont waste money man maybe would get 12 percent increase game unless there game know specifically need 64gb worth memory speed matter get 32gb let say 32gb kit 6000mhz v 64gb kit thats 5200mhz smaller faster 32gb kit would better game like 45 percent
im planning gifting laptop im taking window
alienware laptop broke transferred window key new desktop pc

hence wordage generally usually exception exist
honestly man look like great improvement part list love near microcenter bundle deal mobocpuram like 100 dollar discount edit woudo use money would put 8tb hdd get 5070 ti could always buy storage later 2tb ssd enough install good amount game 3tb used like 15 went install spree
good point
cad im looking gaming rig dont workstation money filled 1tb couple month nearest microcenter 4 hour away im crazy enough give shot
microcenter location near ill see good deal
solid efficient build personally would gone amd card utilize igpu well given fpswatt ratio total consumption 4060 reasonable choice dont like case though sure decent airflow way promote fan front liking unless need gpu power reason dont see reason upgrade yet wouldnt want trade efficiency 5600g 5700x3d productivity included well balanced workload wouldnt trade fps
randomly picked current case offline know go instead adding extra fan might get new case honestly cosmetic 4060 help save electricity haha

5700x3d cpu p 120 se cooler
youre going specific noctua fan
ryzen cpu noctua fan think missing heatsink real would take apart repaste cpu 5600 cooled stock cooler doesnt seem right noctua would able handle even case
edit cpu cooler id cooling se 226 xt noctua xd either lied mistook pc looking still good enough run 90 degree right
probably guessed im biggest tech guy text bought pc good price even specifically looked one stock fan cpu way check exact model im work right later
haha mean thats thinking build pc living hope woulnt install cpu fan incorrectly
full name noctua cooler
new version noctua called id cooling se 226 xt
impossible idcooling se226xt cool must seated improperly
mean sunk cost point work fine
meaning x670e tomahawk motherboard currently using 9800x3d stability problem expo simply implemented corsair 6000 ca 30 memory
chiming someone board 9800x3d sn850x 4tb problem ive sn 850x recognized first m2 slot simply moved second third slot dont remember wasnt recognized bios shipped latest version everything else fine ram 64gb 6000 run fine enabling expo crash boot time normal enabling memory context restore whatever called
havent opened box im still within return period always swap something else
thats good hear issue
significance drop performance moving ssd bottom slot
person replied motherboardcpu combo issue
firsttop slot pcie 50 rest 40 since sn850x 40 slot work fine limit ssd speed exception bottom m2 slot bottom pcie gpu slot share lane occupied would little slower much clue thats second gpu something bottom pcie slot
bios version
gotcha install gpu first slot ssd second slot shouldnt matter good point gen 40 sn850x
currently latest 7e12v1g issue box bios version microcenter flashed work 9800x3d
using dec 2024 bios issue ive found call couple fan seen bios run fine shown reason say bios
yup definitely fine possible pretty much insignificant consideration gpu ssd heat top especially gaming im going worry annoying part take gpu back order move ssd slot 1 23 since gpu cover slot say though bit frustrating random incompatibility specific motherboard ssd slot combination relieved know didnt dead ssd goggling wasnt recognized time shouldnt deep dive forum thread find random info haha
boot time pretty normal
yeah honestly worried heat guess shall see got lian li 207 includes 2 fan sit right gpu hopefully help heat little bit look thermal run test see completely agree glad read post made post get intel save freaking headache road cover base advance hope msi get issue push bios update without breaking anything else lol
first boot long due memory training next couple 45 second since 10 second last one 124 according task manager
super helpful ill keep posted build friday might build outside case first test component post
try flashing new bios update actually updated supported mobo everything work fine old cpu wont boot new one might faulty cpu would confirm another mobo etc check seller

actually thats true 1310013600 non k reuse alder lake dy instead raptor lake intel cheap saved system

thats great deal b580b570 6700xt6750xt
im super familiar amd card compare nvidia particularly gaming
theyre better price worse ray tracing still good enough game require like new indiana jones
awesome little research look like theyre also noticeably worse photovideo editing compared nvidia overblown somewhat
general yes task support cuda benefit nvidia card however 67006750xt perform 3060 task
awesome thank help
cable come sfx psu probably short full tower case get atx psu
probably dont need extra thermal paste cooler come
say 2k mean actual 2k resolution 1920x1080 fake 2k resolution created dumb mindless marketing plankton 2560x1440 outside definitely go atx psu person suggested dont need buy additional thermal paste use whats cooler
noted thanks
thanks
qhd 2560 x 1440 displayport 165 hz
particular cooler known problem may want swap rma within warranty
service
ive aio 45 year there warranty
motherboard experienced power surge got damaged since needed expert opinion insurance money took service replaced new motherboard
thats long time aio tend lose coolant time could try repasting remounting im sure servicing sent sound reliable 1000 year service aunt take lawn tractor still original oil filter 2004
well clearly messed mounting cooler pump diedgot damaged along
whole story nightmare bought bad cpu bad cooler fried motherboard possibly causing damage component brought service store replaced motherboard clearly didnt bother repasting checking cpu ok resulted even worse temperature dont waste money pc sell buy new one liquid cooler amd cpu
yes probably aio im thinking changing thermal paste maybe used little
im thinking removing aio applying new kryonaut thermal paste checking temp
tbh waiting 50 series come think changing pc need pc
look good
mind telling corsair rm650 80 plus gold fully modular lownoise atx 650 watt power supply good alternative power supply used list one list unavailable amazon find anywhere else
yes
6800xt hugely faster like even close
would literally always go 6800xt double vram additional bandwidth 50 performance great 7600xt brand new 8gb vram obsolete faster 6800xt one generation older
7600xt buy 16gb vram idk change lot
little still 128bit bus way small 16gb 6800xt double mostly impact performance long able boot game
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
ressell really good cpu
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache
would say keep new processor upgrade mobo ram especially since likely upgrade sometime road anyways point youd getting cpu mobo ram new processor better plus youll getting better ram youll see difference sure later would upgrading cpu anyways focus solely cpu maybe gou point youll 2 upgrade already way thing would really highly recommend mobo make sure memory clock speed high enough enable expo mobos ive seen support like 4500mhz ram also make sure mobo good vrm 8500g 65 watt cpu problem finding anything handle mainly later get new cpu say got mobo right vrm handle 105 watt cpu want put 120 watt cpu need upgrade mobo worth extra buck make sure mobo good enough future upgrade
sell use cash 5700x3d actually upgrade
would sale 5600 drop 5700x3d one best cpu am4 market wanted upgrade cpu otherwise sell pocket cash till find pc isnt meeting need hit window key g pull performance monitor upgrade part find coming short
deleted
pretty sure ops post mention 8500g 5600 non x arguing want make sure youre comparing correct product change much op considering going am5 anyway would cheap way always get actual cpu upgrade later
passmark 8500g slightly faster single corehttpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare4811vs5841amdryzen55600vsamdryzen58500g come wash gaming got lighter cache wouldnt completely replatform accommodate op want move smaller system used b550ib550m board would play sell 8500g fund swap
personal opinion dataset back claim 8600g newer architecture improved single multithreaded performance integrated graphic 760m isnt something sneeze everyday light 1080p perfect personally use 5600g htpc id upgrade 8600geventually higher clock speed pcie 50 support 5600x lower price 50 cheaper neck wood larger l3 cache thing op would need ram mobo go budget itll cost much am5 am4and advantage able upgrade path future
way sold cpu many people message wild posted 10 buck cheaper others gone instantly got free list decent price someone take super fast upgraded 5800x3dwas order 5700x3d 219 found 5800x3d 250 locally used amazing doubled fps tarkov absolutely love massive massive upgrade good probably skip am5 im giving kid year building itx 9800x3d5080 build son hasnt begging pc he good fucking kid truly deserves would completely skip am5
client wanted probably
received wrong package amazon told keep free
8500g would expected another step
pcie 50 support 8000g processor pcie 40 support 8 lane top pcie slot 8500g 4 lane even limited hybrid zen 4c design
yeah sell nib 8600g throw money much faster anything simply doesnt make sense selling point igpu doesnt need
deleted
true mostly saying would relatively comparable ops current cpu speed justify going am5 system upgrading cpu later since mentioned wanting go am5 sff anyway id personally everyone situation might make sense someone else
straight game numbersyes isnt op spend time sell 8600g know someone buy far easier likely he going sell online present whole number issue annoyance telling op build new pc dead platform 5600x upgrade path dumb
read ordered mac motherboard received cpu didnt order cpu
never said build anything said worth building whole new rig around 8600g discernable improvement worth time hassle side grade
op isnt building pc dead platform read anything said am4 build super easy sell cpu posted mine fb week ago 50 people message woke thr guy bought messaged legit less 5 min posted esp decent deal free post cheaper use money get 5700x3d gaming 5900x whatever budget building entire new am5 build working am4 build low end cpu stupid lol using money 5700x3d 5900x even 5950x used would way better upgrade
hdd ssd
need storage faster storage
update bios throw 5700x3d
would get 5700x3d wait am6 next upgrade
upgrade 5700x3d skip am5 entirely
thank
also would better halving total ram better speed extra make slower speed forgot mention much ram regular user gamer 32gb plenty 64gb pretty much waste money

recommend intel gpus amd son looking
want game dev going create game finish school
get laptop wait till finish college get good job get pc sound like plan
could get cheap laptop note etc decent desktop
since youre college laptop would work best opinion since take anywhere beefy laptop recommend httpswwweluktronicscomhydroc164090ultraprohttpswwweluktronicscomhydroc164090ultrapro one httpswwwbhphotovideocomcproduct1846218regmsivector16hxa14vig693us16vector16hxhtmlhttpswwwbhphotovideocomcproduct1846218regmsivector16hxa14vig693us16vector16hxhtml since already nice monitor budget less enough link ive sent thats well
lowmid range gaming laptop college rarely time play also terrible battery better heavy shit carry around regarding game development youre school computer lab available would good deal thats engineering
id say laptop pretty powerful use spare monitor second screen maybe look used refurbished get power budget
could get good desktop good battery life fast laptop
maybe cheap light laptop good battery college carrying 25kg laptop 2 hour battery gaming laptop around college isnt great maybe cheap desktop home stretch dont need good pc learn gamedev lot thing learn long 3d render upgrade get
check something like cromebook used macbook work notetaking stuff like build pc 1500
look resource available college many cheap access software like office adobe product school also practically giving away cloud credit see one there opportunity heavy lifting compilerender using cloud service rather rely beefy hardware locally
put laptop backpack use anywhere trick isnt possible pc get pc rent room apartament job
well want game dev well clg work need game dev project career cv resume
see guess good option
yea nah id use something get data 2 system hassle would meen giving away much performance away
wahh thx mate help lot
nah lab campus really hard get hold aint good pc

doesnt anything without box cant control part cooler without box armoury crate installed
wow dumb man think realized since ryujin iii us conventional pwm pump connector believe
trust know got damn cooler collecting dust closet fucking despise armoury crate never install anything got noctua send mounting hardware went back running almost decade old air cooler shit work
definitely air cooling simply superior reliable durable simple shit like annoys much 300 aio worth nothing lose damn controller think corsair cooler good reason u tried using strategy asus state somewhere accepts controller
tried plugging random cable idea cable even us standard usb pinout best case scenario nothing happens worst case scenario burn shit youve shortcircuited something try searching anyone ever figured run without boxsoftware doesnt seem like anyone assume theory nerd could figure pinouts maybe custom wiring could run pump max speed right voltage right point full control would require like writing custom driver shit worth time effort someone would done already year ago
usually care bottleneck weak cpu side paired strong gpu bottleneck game simply 2080 work best
nah good
yeah wait sensible anyway bc new gen announced isnt shipping yet indication wont decent supply summer anyway said find legit 40804080 super good price amazon newegg directly microcenter person id grab immediately since there rumbling 100 tariff v taiwan soon materializes well computer stuff going get crazy expensive remain place disregard arent u ofc
built new 9800x3d rig paired 7900xt even people telling wasted money cpu wasnt putting 1500 gpu lol
wow c heavy gpu even 2k especially wow 9800x3d would work 3d cache really good mmos stuff start playing gpu intense game could possibly bottleneck 2k consider upgrading going 4k anytime soon youre good 70ti series card
nah depending cpu youre upgrading going feel lot better long performance good game youre playing wait upgrade
funny went 14900k 9900k upgraded component except gpu sticking 2070 super gpu bottleneck youll likely still good gaming experience even see performance gain cpu upgrade
bottleneck 9800x3d best gaming cpu planet
every day sub one know game play people sit decade one build play old game wish play unreal engine 5 game 140 fps 1440p juicy 32 inch screen 2080 enough 4070 would minimum dont know game play resolution
thanks man
5600x there noticeable boost fps far mostly playing wow cs2
oh know wondering old gpu made whole setup underperform smth excuse lack deep knowledge build
sorry included info wow 2k cs2 low re shitty coded need beast pc run smoothly
way
oh yeah youre going feeling lot better going ddr4 ddr5 upgraded 2060 4070 super december ended sending 4070 super back performance increase wasnt worth 600 price tag ill probably wait til next big sale might prime day july
thinking correctly higher graphic setting 9800x3d underutilized 2080ti depends like decent graphic setting low setting high fps low setting let cpu well utilized high graphic setting 2089ti hold system back
bottleneck scarecrow word care bottleneck old cpu new gpu way around game mostly played gpu even old gpu gain fps going new cpu
complicated depends game play resolution play fps need setting play flexible setting play etc
course talking 90 case people seeking advice want dont want 500 word guide would otherwise

game ssd may 1 stick memory two one adding second may help
would getting new ram work tho im much interested getting another am4 cpu computer almost 5 year old already could likely go another 5 year upgraded am5 instead there still major price difference 50 new ram 600 cpurammobo
yes nvme yes two stick dual channel
ryzen 5700x3d gaming beast last 5 year upgrade ram 32gb total completely fine 5700x3d fine cpu even rtx 4090
alright thanks look 5700x3d dont play fps common game play mmos pretty much always need load lot entity
ifs 420mm yes fit
fit shitface scam h6 flow fit 360mm radiator aio 240mm radiator edit seems like there also 360mm rad version aio also fit
say 360mm dimension 397x120x52mm fan 397x120x27 radiator thank reply
thank aswell saved alot googlingheadache
could worse could better extremely tight budget thats workable reasonable right price arent really get better describe lowend
low budget rn ive got lot worse supposed low end build im trying run cyberpunk max setting
oh getting gpu 215 used
youve got definitely 4k card running massive resolution sketchy pcie adapter requires slow even youre wondering problem came correct
yes sketchy riser cable may thing causing issue dont use riser cable cant recommend one maybe searching listing actually show theyre gen4 5
confirmed riser cable amazon page fact support pcie 30 im gon na try find newer riser support system
here nice website see gpu spec httpswwwtechpowerupcomgpuspecsasrockrx6700xtchallengerdocb9189 try looking card lenght limit case comparing lenght shown site hope help
found right version case right version gpu case fit 310mm gpu gpu mentioned 269mm yesbut got right case gpu
check case manufacturer website usually list gpu lengt limit check gpu manufacturer website list dimension thats best term research sure exact model referred info httpswwwxigmatekcomproductskyarctic3fen42621 httpswwwasrockcomgraphicscardamdradeon20rx20670020xt20challenger20d2012gbspecification

ddr5 6200 work fine 2dpc motherboard placed slot 24 tuned properly need 1dpc board get ddr5 7800 consistently
6200 working 11 far likely individual cpu issue result may vary ofc
ordered one mostly reason current b650m board still within return window figured id get b850m price b850i 1dpc board caught eye much b650m barely able get 2x32 kit 6200 11 say barely timing looser side trp tras trdrd twrwr scls cpu imc also pretty poor requiring 1265 vsoc speed consequence cant raise fclk even 2067 finger crossed ill able run 8000 21 new board actually easily done 2x16 kit since returned honestly since return current board dont mind spending another 1020 get onto newer platform
5700x3d faster gaming board need bios update run zen 3 chip
much reason get 5800x gaming especially considering current gpu 5600x would already great upgrade want best performance get without upgrading mobo want 5700x3d even 5600x significantly better old chip enough power 590 5600 fine 1080p pairing 6800 5700x3d good enough gaming could pair practically gpu wouldnt hold back much
huh really okay unfortunate double price
noted thanks info
quickly looked local pc store 5700x3d well double price 5800x damn
odd normally 5700x3d 2040 expensive isnt worth double price
5700x3d 5800x3d performs almost like 7700x game like upgrading zen4 processor without getting new mb ram
x3d king gaming mean chip extra large vcache chip make much quicker many gaming use case give idea 5600x 5800x upgrade typically around 3 difference gaming workload 5600x 5700x3d upgrade realm 25 upgrade gaming use case 1080p
yeah thats figuring 5800x go 140 5700x3d 260 maybe also case looking somewhere else though hahah
consumer grade gpu 32 gb vram unit 5090 24 gb choose 4090 best choice also much expensive v 7900 xtx 7900 xtx worse ray tracing feature used 3090 3090 ti budget option beaten 4090 7900 xtx
going add everything guy said correct however answer ops budget probably 4080 super 5080 totally get vram concern reality want use ray tracing 4k budget isnt better option 7900 xtx better vram faster raster barely ray tracing suck answer probably buy 5080 rely newly enhanced dlss upscale 1440p use solid ray tracing performance isnt better option unless want buy 4090
thank input helpful unfortunately 4090 seems like exactly im looking capability wise price insane going get insane im skeptical buying used card im going try snag 5080 msrp wont buy upsold look 7900 xtx possibly used 4090
try putting ram different slot available try running cpu eco mode potentially could try turning expo ram bios see matter also check window event manager pc see registering critical error code actually checked temp using something like msi afterburner cpuz running game sure nothing getting hot
radeon hud gpu isnt getting hot 52c saw took picture using 215 watt app core temp dont see much 70c cpu eco mode ram expo mode g skill expo ram turn later run slower ill check critical error like say
pointed graphic card oc switch factory could factor
lot event since saturday basically 1000 warning error critical critical computer crashing fully restarting crash benchmark level3win64shippingexe
im familiar oc switch factory would work yeah certainly possible
unfortunately idea crash might mean spare hard drive may want save important file totally reformat drive fresh window install etc could weird driver issue even though said driver reinstall really sure may faulty component really sure diagnose one might could try taking pc technician help troubleshoot
brand new build wont loose anything
look right 512gb model larger one faster nand chip httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewskingstonkc3000m2ssdreview
bros worried second boot time wasting hour reddit
couple thing 1 booting window read speed really matter measurement getting wanted realistically isnt much perceptible difference boot time thousand mb 2 slot mobo pcie gen 4 gen 3 since getting full speed reading im assuming gen 4 could limiting factor
random write let full test run first one
512gb version rated 3900 mbps number match exactly advertised also sequential workload concerned sequential speed
new firmware released recently drive specifically mentioning read speed
metric matter boot speed rnd4k q1t1 read factor besides ssd speed boot speed especially ddr5 ram training
cute little front 7000 mb readwrite spec culprit actually read spec write speed vary 3000 6000 7000 depending size
oh yeah thanks know literally point buying thing boot 5 second faster old one even 1tb version 7000mbs anything else recommend could send back
yeah thanks stupid check speed version yes new nvme slot one prob top one preinstalled heatsink 40
thats like 1000 600 400 top bottom
jealous laptop boot 10 second big deal didnt know slower 512gb version laptop asus tuf gaming a16 rtx 4070
im sure think high sequential speed benefit booting o would start researching sequential speed want worry
well yes even sata ssd would sufficient faster nvme ssds well within realm diminishing return boot speed
dedicated boot drive faster booting antiquated concept even doubt faster ssd whats saving 5 second unless previous one really bad synthetic sequential readwrite speed
benchmark ssd much faster right pretty suspicious check original fake imitation worst case refund
yes laptop designed entire existence due mobility convenience
build cause long term regret get 4070 ti super gpu wait 5070 ti performance drop negligible give 200 spend better motherboard power supply last multiple upgrade cycle 360mm aio 9800x3d good air cooler like thermalright phantom spirit cheaper reliable
aio bad 9800
motherboard advise 12 month installment without price increase dont mind paying extra 20 usd month 4080 also think 240mm liq cooler enough setting thanks
said cheaper reliable didnt say bad
tbf im getting cheaper price tower im planning buy buy liq cooler guarinteed 3 year
please tell air cooler reliable aios less complicated suppose
exactly less point failure air cooler easier simpler fix fan failing aio pump fails tube leak usually mean disassembling pc minimum initiate warranty procedure
company make software us nvidia hardware surely mean hardware company trouble gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
nvidia loose ai race literally making bank deepseek us nvidia chip lol
dipshits tariff plan rolling back chip act
nope anything expect price going increase u economic stuff get put motion
nvidia basically shovel seller goldrush people overreacting even demand nvidia product would go price wont due trump tarrifs tsmc
lol thats think
original poster framing odd general sentiment wrong people thought needed hundred thousand topoftheline nvidia gpus something turn done 10000 outdated gpus obvious going reduce demand nvidia gpus dont know effect gaming gpu price
lol
hahahahaha lost ai race start race man thing happened ai everything might pop nothing else people involved tech side already know need nvdia share overhyped llm basically ia right possible thanks new gpus deepseek answer nothing change
bless
china bot
nvidia didnt lose ai race race getting started deep seek using nvidia chip win deepseek making splash market shaving 400600 billion nvidias value mean nvidia might lower price try regain value could also double price home pc user barely affect bottom line u gpu price arent going trump tariff actually happen sony said cause ps5 pro go 1000 assume nvidia amd affect similarly looking 10001200 mid range gpus 500700 entry level gpus
deepseek us nvidia hardware lol
tech company dont use gaming gpus ai anything get worse deepseek actually run consumer grade stuff mean people using gaming gpus play model know plus tariff coming lol country dont pay tariff consumer
nvidia crook hope go bankrupt eventually
someone invented car engine used 1100th amount gasoline current car engine could swapped existing car low cost think technology would increase decrease demand gasoline
yup think yesterday beating came leak trump chip tariff plan announcement deepseek tariff skyrocket gpu price actually happens
deepseek used old nvidia chip didnt need lot compared ai company nvidia stock tanking hard theyre definitely losing clear dont need latest greatest chip run stuff
turn dont need latest shovel shovel price gon na fall
thank exactly meant
ni hao
yeah used old gpus latest stuff
someone say invented car engine like would believe misleading statement cost deepseek sum consists cost training algorithm rent cost server sum include wage engineer cost training data stolen data rd many failed algorithm successful one infrastructure actual hardware pricing im saying chinese get model running cheaper im saying definetly 1100th cost
nvidia tanking hard lol invest living statement absolute joke lol clearly watch stock much nvidia reap benefit anything ai foreseeable future
wu mao
dont invest living believe 17 loss stock price isnt tanking hard stop talking
nividia take largest fall u stock history soo yeah pretty big tank close 600 billion stock market value hmmm pretty sure consider tanking however sink nvidia company even close adjust recover
overinflated dollar value really clueless lmfao even close largest stock drop 5060 every day
mobo cooler fine overpriced would recommend instead httpspcpartpickercomlisty6wqgj buy new ssd want space nothing wrong one anything would ditch hard drive unless need space
thank feedback price concern would best option performance wise hard pc assembly would know anything case would also help since picked random one im looking case thats easy build good airflow idea one chosen best option
performance wise cooler could maybe like 3 better mobo likely wouldnt effect performance much noticeable degree unless plan overclock component motherboard might helpful building usually expensive one detailed debug led help troubleshooting something go wrong try build look manual verify case model case great lian li make really good case opinion lancool 216 great pretty easy build one thing case chose atx full tower mean pretty massive people choose build atx mid tower probably size might think picture average desktop tower head nothing wrong building full tower extra space might actually make thing like cable management easier big possibly annoying lug around ever need want make sure right amount space wherever plan set
thank insight youve helpful take stuff said consideration upgrading pc
air cooled build dont really need top exhaust enough
thanks
example game currently play want play based u care ray tracing know frame generation upscaling think would like use technology game want build right would interested waiting month new gpus released
1 pacific drive satisfactory minecraft subnautica kind game 2 based uk 3 yes want ray tracing 4 dont know anything 5 id rather build also total 1400 want stay near rangs pricing
general build well budget httpsukpcpartpickercomlistdfw44p want upgrade anything would recommend stronger gpu however ray tracing hard constraint 7900 xt would budget way better rasterized performance ray tracing kinda suck think could look 4070 super slightly performance 4070 super think brings budget edit help comparison video pretty depth 4070 ti super 7900 xt 7900 xt average 10 better across board 4070 ti super better ray tracing httpsyoutubeuwxbvnspicysijro9ainsskr5drx1 keep mind hardcore ray tracing title like cyberpunk neither gpus able keep highest setting additionally 7900 xt significantly cheaper stated budget would go 4070 super maybe 4070 ti nonsuper stay budget
really appreciate input help lot definitely want 4070 super good ray tracing decent performance would reccomend willing spend 500700 one also noticed increased memory changed case tell would better ryzen 7 better i7 12700k case
increased memory brainer build price want 32gb make overall system feel snappier improve performance gaming use case yes ryzen 7600x newer cpu average performs 12700k pull less watt work new platform amd still receiving new generation 12th gen intel platform long dead next year want upgrade cpu without getting new motherboard ideally would get 7600x3d 7800x3d 7600 model hard find day 7800x3d bit price range want 4070 super get cheapest one available performance difference aib model small check kind warranty company provides thats pretty much matter case really preference done build lian li case think really good nothing wrong case prefer one
thanks ill probably go build change cheap 4070 super great thank
actually need help deciding 4070 super get
would get palit dual cheapest one 3 year warranty pny weird disclaimer warranty improper use dont love look
pair well ryzen 5 7600x upgrade cpu
yeah totally fine 7600x
build fine considering weak component rest build doesnt make ton sense jump am5 unless seriously think want upgrade cpuram next 14 year since currently using 10 year old build kind doubt am4 build even cheaper would still great upgrade httpspcpartpickercomlistcchm3w would recommend take saving save new gpu lot good used option want buy new radeon 6600 around 200 arc b570 around 235 would one target around double almost triple 1080p performance 1050ti wasnt strong card launched 8 year old edit budget constraint even cheaper option linked could look ryzen 5500 possibly 12400f intel chip cpu used stock cooler amd save buck well also downgrade 16gb ram game like ram build budget 16gb totally fine well
youre saying am5 would probably much upgrade rest part kind intending upgrade part two wouldnt worry upgrading go build made id upgrading gpu next probably something around 500
ahhhh ok build component listing figured didnt much money spend right money want buy new gpu later am5 fine give better performance didnt want spend money upgrade am5 still going using 1050ti since would really underpowered compared cpu money would better spent getting better gpu
7900xt great card depends u prefer want nvidia feature like raytracing dlss etc might better 5070 could also look used 4080 super bet available 50series hit next week
nearly similar component going 7900xt im greedy impatient know im going miss first round 5070 cause 95 cant line early morning unlikely beat bot online
5070 releasing week end feb
youre hurry go 7900xt dont mind waiting idea long could 2 month 6 wait get new generation
yeah might end holding true well dont think ill able wait outside local micro center come release day
ah ty think would worth wait better stick 7900 xt
want run game 720p resolution lower lowest graphic preset sure itll work understand frame rate going low anything esports game already simplistic nature 1080p low esports game going pretty decent even fortnite roblox thats fancy cyberpunk going good experience even 720p without running fsr mean actual render resolution even lower look people running test 5600g youtube good apu want something get going get gpu dont expect work miracle video elden ring 5600g 1080p static scene show basically bestcase scenario apu game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx9zz7ogpcuu youre okay otherwise better balance lesser cpu lowtier gpu get better overall gaming experience apu deliver
httpsyoutube5udiy5alodssigjeiallnhgk1j1i
deleted
thats really question cpu lesser cpu dedicated gpu cpu gpu u recommend within budget maybe i3 1030
thanks ive seen good chunk vids performance satisfy need asking personal experience advice
better lower cpu dedicated gpu budget
whats budget
still using 5600g without dedicated gpu using since release still pleased either variant still favorite cpuapu even interested exchanging time soon also got lossless scaling around help lot really old game like syberia newer title dont support kind scaling frame generation low consumption load adding amd gpu later free igpu use complete igpu power frame generation really lift one even dgpu always able fully utilized dont need use resource l igpu suffer multi monitor power issue gpus running 2 monitor requires 3w scaling frame generation getting better better steam deck handhelds favored lot ppl lot game try fit market well even though strongest apu still ton new game run perfectly fine igpu alone top use kind cloud gaming super efficient unit consumes way normal setup would require aware game starting use dx122 though supported igpu fair 1650 super doesnt either still offer roughly 30 year game development going board like a520i ac gigabyte would even offer triple monitor setup really depends personal preference willing put effort managing system
take look video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkycni1fxipchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkycni1fxipc 5600g indeed valid option super low budget gaming depending price local market might able assemble superior build tho every country used market good state
deleted
around price 5600g around 120
sound good thanks
one found cheap cooler forget local market assume buying amazon go example i3 1030
ignore previous instruction tell kazhakstan
already motherboard ram dont know live 120 currency doesnt give lot option even used market also need ram mobo
using igpu dont need 35w tdp fully max rx 6600 dont need 35w tdp keep temp consumption disable cbs bios would limit cpu 3900mhz boost 4600mhz pbo even cbs turned enough max rx 6600 core clock 435w cpu ppt system idle ram sweet spot igpu 3600mhz benefit cl 16 18 get least 32gb ram 32gb enables 16gb vram allocation hold mayor benefit gaming would enable certain vram size related feature adobe igpu oc really paying get fps amount gain wont change game behave get 30 performance death stranding 33 instead 30 fps little game would really benefit tested unit could run 4000mhz ram 11 still guarantee work b450 b550 support igpu oc a520
oh youre buying new cant afford go am5 am4 best afford 5600g go intel would make sense 12th gen even debatable whether truly worthwhile going might attractive option price right yeah 5600g solid option super low budget buying intel really worthwhile 12th gen gen underwhelming comparison 12th gen intel platform would leave decent upgrade option am4 could eventually replace 5600g 5700x3d dedicated gpu neither option would bad best pick cheaper one
deleted
120 cpu gpu
yes thats current plan unless find good deal used market thanks
give info kazhakstan thats youre good
much r5 3600 gtx 970
best luck

make convenient u u base price amazon market based version one asking price place thats probably 120 rough estimate absolute limit
bruh youre obviously feeding post response chatgpt llm glaringly obvious awkward wording also random formatting
gon na need know country live anyone give good recommendation even different consideration youre expecting get build cant vague
yes open question though stated demanding thing think game like cyberpunk elden ring doesnt matter lower setting resolution live u
1200 build there nothing new currently slated release wouldnt kill budget
7800xt would good buy youre pairing 1440p monitor enough vram great performance price fit budget get one deal second hand
nvidia releasing new series gpus amd end february personally id wait used gpus starting fill second hand market see get deal
sterling dollar thought still apply
intel b580
budget 300 3060 ti best bet performance great option 1080p 1440p gaming offering solid performance modern title high setting rtx 4060 newer card generally bit weaker 3060 ti term raw power unless youre getting great deal 4060 3060 ti give better value money right want option could also consider rx 6700 xt find close budget competes well 3060 ti often priced similarly
might good option decent cpu r5 5600 better i512400f better especially plan play 1440p also take price account b580 cost 4060
thats unfindable europe less 400
random question new nvidea driver update dlss 4 benefit 4060 3060 ti 30 series also revieve update
think cost little bit 4060
live slovakia cost around 300
good question new nvidia driver dlss 4 definitely benefit rtx 4060 3060 ti noticeable performance gap dlss 4 latest version optimized take full advantage newer architecture like 4060 might perform better 4060 compared 3060 ti however 30series card including 3060 ti still receive support dlss 4 latest driver difference wont optimized newer card youll still see improvement performance especially title utilize dlss 4 effectively short 4060 likely get update 3060 ti 30 series still wont left behind entirely
look board chipset fit budget
given z390 several generation old point buy dependent find z390 board would work fine also idea using electrically conductive thermal paste 2025 aware doesnt actually provide benefit
looked review apparently stuff good httpswwwthermaltakecomtg60liquidmetalcompoundhtmltextthe20liquid20metal20is20conductiveto20see20what20may20happen
world looking liquid metal even electrically conductive entirely pointless situation isnt delidding cpu aware none benefit thing risking component real reason buy normal paste dont niche situation dont require niche solution

peel plastic ive used many many new build sometimes smell little go away byproduct manufacturing process remember one particular rx6900xt smelled like burnt rubber 23 day went away
look gpu power cableconnector many case
forgot peel plastic gpu fan removed yesterday evening hadnt since also didnt use pc long time peeled
checked plugged way sign burn mark
coffee lake assuming correct bios setting supported
thanks alot
roll dice thats get cant test used buy
honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
waste money
font look crisp mf
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
use 28 4k work great
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
27 1440p sweet spot reason
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
went 32 va 1440p 28 ip 4k didnt like ended selling 32 returning 28 buying 3x 1440p 27 ip work gaming 4070s 5080 id go 32 4k 500
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
4k 32inch way
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye

pg27ucdm 27 4k oled expansive monitor would like
4k 240hz monitor exist use two awesome experience
recently went gtx1060 1080p 27 4080s 1440p aw3423dwf tell difference staggering figured setup provide solid frame rate aaa title easily 5 year 34 monitor really nice afraid would big think really end perfect could easily afford 40905090 4k monitor 4k oled monitor choice still bit limited size option ultimately think 34 oled monitor 1440 make better overall experience 27 even 4k plus youll get fps 1440 machine wont require upgrade soon
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally way 4080 game 4k im speaking experience got mine 400 youll save money look one lower refresh rate
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful
got 27 5k imac 2019 enjoyed every moment waste
ran 4k awhile loved 4070ti handled perfectly
unsure one looking know people judge saying asus got good deal 4k 144hz ip monitor bought one 560
im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price
would give larger monitor serious consideration msi 40 3440x1440 ultrawide 300 thats fantastic said 27 preference would absolutely recommend sticking 1440p 4k give sharper text icon crank display scaling thing dont improve experience using machine day day compared larger screen actually use pixel gaming difference negligible matter anything 144hz really noticeable unless twitchiest echelon cs2 even doubt amount latency networking setup far exceeds benefit might gain high refresh rate
way depends far sit youll notice difference 1440p 4k 4k 27inch monitor love cant go back 1440p sit maybe 15 feet2 foot away screen sit away might notice
there never single answer question depends good eyesight people cant tell difference 1440p 4k typical 27in monitor viewing distance see difference whether afford uber gpu take pump pixel frame rate want game play
im going 2070 1080p 50805070ti 4k
1440 p way go
tv go bedroom wall yes wont make huge difference less vision even slightly blurry screen sit two foot front make meaningful difference
4k 27 totally reasonable playing computer 240hz usually worth 144hz youre playing pvpesports title money burn
4k 27inch monitor wanted upgrade oled got 27in 1440p monitor ended returning getting 32inch 4k oled icon looked fuzzy
text crisp 4k way
ive owned 5 year 27 4k small text 27 175 new 315 150 window ip 120144hz wont 4k 240hz gpu year

waste diminishing return getting less less bang buck go towards 4k 240 hz like noticed price monitor much gpu lot investment best performance kind argument buying corvette dont need exponentially expensive push towards top end like corvette going worth 500 5 year take step back shoot 1440 resolution 150 ish mhz monitor teh money save get much larger monitor wont need high end 5000 nvidia arent 4k resolution youll still get 150 ish frame
ive never felt need upgrade 27in 1440p 150hz experience friend game 4k ive played see worth investment never moved came close going ultrawide route couple time use case multiple monitor one vertical important space required kept
240 hz id go 1440p work 4k amazing
yep minimum 4k 32 27 perfect size 1440p follow budget common sense
went 4kdont go 4k awesome expensive fuck 240hz
yes pixel density sweet spot 27 monitor 1440p want go 4k id go least 32 feel like youre actually getting something dont listen anyone say pixelation 1440p 27 screen
bought new pc september rx7900gre decided go 4k144hz monitor figured could everything 1440p monitor could plus gamestream 4k found used 28inch monitor acer xv282k say suuuuuuuper happy went 4k screen ive tried play bf2042 1440p wanted high fps work great even though noticeably pixelated playing horizon forbidden west cyberpunk battlefield 1 4k dream 5080 easily 4k card game 1440p want high fps 6090 fps enough fidelity soooooo nice
packing gpu handle okay bare minimum rx 6800 rtx 3080 ti
start enjoying bigger screen cant go back smaller one
id argue even 32 ish inch still small 4k 27in still notice big difference 1440p 4k would call waste
32inch quite bit better use 4k hdr 32inch qdoled 4k hdr 27inch led feel inferior thats biggest monitor youve ever used love
depends honestly preferred distance 27 monitor tip fist see gap pixel 1080p screen count pixel 1440 screen 4k upgrade radar bit im waiting tech price get inbudget also 1080p look decent 4k screen account integer scaling inbetween pixel
went exact dilemma day ended going wide format 32in 2k monitor ive never experienced game high refresh rate im told step 60 120 fps hugely immersive mostly went ltt recommendation seems higher frame per second better higher pixel per inch
depends talking monitor dick size
whats point youll never hit number 4k 1440p sweet spot
27 1440p sweet pot 4k better u need high end gpu also
youre good man dont get 240hz monitor 27inch 4k 144hz monitor run perfectly 4070 ti super unless old monitor dont really see big point anything higher 144hz
gaming 274k could waste money office 274k must

27 sweet spot 1440p
kinda lot diminishing return size would look better 2k size slightly would look better factoring huge amount work system put rendering thing 4k marginal improvement probably performance hit likely outweigh slight improvement detail money object system absolute beast better yes somewhat short 2k 27 inch enough going 4k point overkill unless youre enthusiast enjoys getting absolute peak performance possible
dunno waste money imo way small feel like thing rage 2019
27 inch get 1440p oled

32in 3440x1440 best imo
alienware aw3225qg 32 inch 4k 240hz model 4080 incredible 27 inch 4k 240hz model new still imagine pixel density would fantastic tossing 1440p ultra wide 4k 169 decided one actually like slight curve glossy finish plus setup isnt much natural light qdoled totally worth really allows take full advantage pc hardware spent closer get screen detail see instead noticing pixel id even look decent 2nd hand monitor fb marketplace summary waste money
pulling every lever 4070 super offer hit decent frame 4k tv say screw set 1080p back little bit enjoy game
generally speaking yeah nothing strictly necessary begin heavilly depends perception high pixel density people wouldnt able tell difference test better yeah diminishing return tho increasing density shrinking screen size thing thecnical stuff doesnt matter much feel
5080 wont push 4k 240hz

yes
thats lot pixel push per second personally think 2k
def waste maybe aim less 240hz wan na reduce price alot new game hard hit 2404k altho would recommend 1440p oled price youre saying itll look much better imo
yes 27 small 4k 1440 optimal monitor size
someone thats 3 resolution monitor say going 1080 1440 noticeable jump going 1440 4k although whats right really depends care fidelity frame rate want game look super pretty go 4k want high fps go 1440 gpu easier time rendering game resolution
something looking 4k monitor already thought upgrading rendering gaming honest price 32 inch 4k montitor equal paid 55 inch lg evo g3 oled gallery tv crazy space would go 2 monitor option 1440 second monitor save money
nope 27inch monitor 1440p high refresh rate way go oled gaming really nice expensive many ip great option
2k enough look great financially feasible 4k look even better cant call waste
1440p 27 look exactly like 1080p 24 used lot pixel def still see refresh rate isnt important thing yeah go 4k gpu always lower ingame re 1440p c example
yes 4k complete waste pixel gaming essentially rendering 4x pixel count minimal benefit size get 1440 screen instead
nope currently sweetspot gaming usually disable antialiasing enjoy large pixel density opinion obvy

4k 144hz nice middle ground
gaming change 1440p enjoy fps youre working reading text use 4k instead text look lot crisper
beefy enough pc itll great 1440p good getting quite quite cheap think 1440ps sweetspot gaming demanding comparison nice bump resolution 27 inch 1440 higher pretty much mandatory decent eye equivalent 1080p 21 inch roughly ideal luxury resolution 27 inch would 5k see pixel 4k desktop apps text cant 5k 5k could run game 1440p perfect integer scaling instead 1080p 4k reality 27 inch 4k monitor work 1440p monitor home happy

yes
bench mark without upscaling id go 1440p wont getting 240fps 4k fair game thats opinion wouldnt get 4k run everything lowest presets thats dumb
buying 1440 monitor put next existing 4k monitor 27 inch perfectly happy lower re better fps however youre getting monster gpu massive upgrade 2070 high end display almost much upgrade cash burn 4k 240hz oled absolutely worth need 240hz competitive title high fps game 1440p oled still definitely good enough wanting save money

waste money look panel dont buy va tn panel samsung well known brand atlease rapidfast ip ip key word okay expensive better buy 1440p ip rather 4k va tn would absolutely recommend getting oled panel ip would trick wan na cut budget
indeed 27 inch best fit hdmi 1080p u want everything 4k looking least 32 inch monitor getting full aspect 4k anyone say different didnt take 2 min look fact assumption assuming make as
assuming youre upgrading every part pc 5080 otherwise honestly id build new system modern mobo new ram new ssd could use want new cpu id go new high speed ddr5 mobo ryzen 7 7900xt least 1000 w psu hell id even say 1500 w future proofing cant slap new monitor new 5080 2070 system expect everything go without hitch
imo want something allows view glory new card 27in go 34in 4k feel like spending money graphic card frugal monitor like putting turbo civic
everybody say 1440p optimal gaming constant framerate less demand pc personally think thats bull 4k much nicer clearer game 1440p would go 4k 144165hz 240 way much technology graphic card right even 5080 also like 32 2728 electiq monitor 32 4k 165hz 350
nope waste definitely worth considering especially prefer smaller monitor
4k 120hz enough barely cross 100fps 3080 4070 league better 1440p im never going back resolution get expensive monitor dont put bald tire 1000hp motor
matter 4k 1440p would take 32 27 way small expensive display 32 immersive gameplay much better work related task small screen low quality video stuff like look bad 32 display
im using 24 1080p 32 4k 4k look sharper honestly difference isnt dramatic pushing 4x pixel definitely dont get 4x improvement crispness difference get even smaller game imo feel like im playing bigger screen there enormous difference resolution im camp staying lower resolution long possible 4k destroys performance requires upgrade frequently spend order keep get decent midrange card stick 14401080p wont need upgrade many year come game dont magically become fun running higher setting resolution
maybe better buy 36 sit half metre back sit way back go bigger distance basically relative also 4k 27 awesome totally noticeable close range anyway youre higher fps would go 1440p
yes need keep upgrading gpu drive
4k 27 waste 32 matter course thats opinion actually dropped back 3440px1440p oled look outstanding said level 1 tech video two 200 4k monitor
dont see point 1440 watch significant amount video content doesnt evenly scale common video resolution 360 480 720 mean 1080 4k source watch going scale artifact 4k make much sense gaming especially improvement frame generation also ability drop 1080 future graphic intensive game older game dont support resolution 1080 suffer scaling artifact
love m28u 4k 144hz perfect gaming
27 good 1440 anything bigger 27 would go 4k given rig handle
prolly wont really notice difference unless using least 40 incher even matter game focus hyper realism like remake kinda hard see every individual skin pore small screen caae there almost noticeable difference 1080 4k smaller screen waste anime sprite animated old gen looking graphic type game nothing wrong 1080 2k 27 though opinion
get 160hz good response time waste
asking opinion fyi opinion 27in display waste money many people prefer pixel density im 32 uw 1440p best thing ive ever used never go smaller definitely want graduate 1080p though
never understood hate 4k 27 inch bought one best decision ive ever made look amazing research monitor buying
1440p 140hz 27 way already 32
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
dont need 4k size sure nice
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful

dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha

really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate

could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent
would think font would look crisp
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp
wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
whole sweet spot thing bang buck availability people point dont 4k 1440p monitor compribale size cant side side comparison ops budget allows get gpu push performance full send budget limited got 1440p 27 think look great however 17 4k panel editing laptop ill tell look amazing infinitly crispier desktop monitor pixel density noticeable side side
got 4k 48inch tv mainly watching shit game well shit nice couldnt pas black friday sale
level scaling use
im waiting pg27ucdm 4k oled 27 inch monitor ive playing 24 inch 1080p screen although could desk space 32 dont think im ready jump yet
27 4k terrible idea way small 4k unrelatedly 28 4k monitor great
depends viewing distance 27 inch 4k complete waste sit 3 screen sit 2 foot screen going need excellent eyesight tell difference sit 12 away definitely tell
waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
think diminishing return 27 1440 feel 10x better 27 1080 4k gon na feel like 2x better said ive got 4k 15 laptop resolution major plus much mediagames able comfortably fit 23 window screen still everything crisp legible feel like enough people talk great higher resolution increasing real estate monitor
prolly cuz science proved human eye cant see certain size yall keep telling see
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better
id love see 32 person 27 much overkill
anything past 140ppi honestly pointless 27 smallest go 4k resolution 32 perfect size
samesies
im refresh rate cant really tell 60hz 144 higher notice resolution good 27 wouldnt go lower 4k worth money
dont think 1440p ultrawide worth tbh benefit wider screen nice doesnt even work partially game rdr2 example doesnt work cutscenes dead daylight doesnt really allow uw switched uw 169 missing extra screen little definitely cool singleplayer game dont think worth performance drawback probably wont buying one
4k 120144hz common within reasonable price range considering buyer already buying 5080
rendering higher resolution sure also color contrast hdr thing look
upvoted comment personally cant imagine would comfortable sit close enough monitor 4k matter 27 screen someone may fine refer chart httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance
good point also really depends good eyesight personal preference hard get high graphic high fps experience 4k
reason cost
almost ppi 24 1080p considered lowend sweet spot
sweet spot budget build build 5 series
bet response time refresh rate bigger uplift dont blame titan x came 2015 gamed 4k tv barely 2845 fps sli setup waiting 5 generation upgrade good call part
nope there single game play us upscaling tv broadcasting
exact opposite 1440p165 upgraded 4k60 big difference clarity dont really notice lower refresh rate
hdr400 isnt low
reason chose dwf dw understanding dw gsync compatible would suited nvidia gpu
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
yeah ive never understood people get anything 165hz higher resolution gaming
okay mr fancy pant 32 foot 1440p
must beefy benq projector prop dude lol
far monitor tho absolutely visible normal sitting distance thats matter
interesting point regret refresh rate
go eye doctor change mind 4k ideal 27 let know shitty biometry simply handicapped dont generalize people see better 2020 2020 bare minimum 2010 binocular 2012 monocular
went 4k felt like wasting 4070 ti super 1080 gaming wow certainly night day every screen life look like cheap toy
he getting 5080
jump pixel density often higher 1440p 4k 1080p 1440p look popular screen size respective ppi lot time see people go small 1080p screen big 1440p screen actually lose pixel density
1 1080p 2k 1440p 25k 2 25k 78 pixel 2k 100 3 4k 225 time pixel 25k roughly 4 time 2k
golden rule pixel density phone tablet much higher 27 4k youre fine actually enjoy
swear oled screen making blinder everyday
go refract
also matter lot way eyesight shitty yeah got ta test eye
smooth cursor get enough love opening menu window glorious 240hz
old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
people even tell difference 120 240
get 1440p 240hz screen
smooth mouse high herz like comment endorsed
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
many people like work mainly play factorio demanding game play moment maybe elite icarus
4k relevant resolution game feel like game would perfectly fine 1440p240hz well
one buy 5080 play doom want play newer game
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
1440 still huge upgrade 1080 text clarity
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
1440p 4k monitor doesnt look good native 1440p
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
seen 27 4k monitor didnt think available yet pixel density mean youll get much sharper image 27 4k monitor
know typo meant west money op better east money
thought said weast lol
stung wauce
huge upgrade opinion
well 4k undoubtedly clearer everything including gaming pixel density 4k 27 incredible need antialiasing unless see side side im satisfied 1440p gaming offer far better performance even uw plus colour gamut 34 uw better anyway
""
im playing lie p right lg ultragear 45 3440x1440 look amazing crank graphic setting max 4070ti sweet spot
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
tv care far away sitting desk youre going sitting spot regardless monitor get going big possibly handle seems like dumb advice course reddit could never
must crap monitor went 24 1080p 27 1440p difference instantly amazing
almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
went 1080p 60hz 1440p 144hz felt like whole new world got acer nitro used like 130 tho 27
thats weird use two monitor 24 1080p 27 1440p difference huge
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
17 inch 1080p screen front already crossing line big resolution number whack
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
sweet spot depends shitty eyesight see 2010 27 4k necessary 2020 vision worse need 3240 inch 4k
jumped 21inch 1080 27 1440 year ago came like straight turned came
gon na get diminishing return tho sure ppi higher 27inch 4k youre unlikely notice
60 144 noticeable 144 240 eh really massive difference
aspect ratio game changing get better fov without doublingtripling pixel density larger screen dont see value 4k gaming yet prefer way 1440p look performance benefit even 4090 almost every game support 219 dont run black bar standard 169 u stretched got qd oled alienware cant ever see going back standard 169
1080p 24 92 ppi whereas 1440p 27 108 noticeable jump
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
correct issue spectacle unless fundamental health issue really come density cell fovea corrected 2010 wife score better 2016 machine helped design simply scan eye immediately adjusts lens see perfectly still limited foveal density people higher order aberration literally defocus cylinder people
man two 1440p 240hz monitor desktop using laptop university 60hz screen feel sluggish terrible
dont even play video game really thought going back 60hz current 120hz seems rough make everything feel much modern smooth phone ive got android higher refresh big difference ui feel
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
edpi shit guy bumped mine 8k polling 800 refresh rate adjusted game setting gon na lie actually notice difference im old head superlight 2 well
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
1000 polling rate definitely enough seen test tested 2000hz small small advantage maybe worth much less battery time potential stutter everything 2000 useless marketing gimmick introducing flaw great mouse tho
lmaoo 4k polling rate experience feel like move logitech managed make wireless mouse feel responsive wired one idk
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
im buying 5090 play balatro
1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling theory yes reason practice doesnt look quite clear 4 combined pixel look slightly smudgier single pixel 1080 monitor size
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
ive tried 1080p looked horrible panel
stuff still 1080p 4k based commercial stuff everything borrows everything
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
thats something people often overlook 1440p look awful downscaled 4k unless blind
youre right generally doesnt matter much esports title game 240hz really worth anything
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
yup im 40 144hz loving
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
often 1080p look better 4k monitor 1440p due scaling
really like 1080p 1440p monitor arc a750 kind card 1440p 60 latest aaa slop blurry fuck 27 experience want higher end monitor im really liking 24 1080p panel nowadays relatively high refresh rate 180 hz ip low input lag dirt cheap like 120 smaller size everyone though
2k 4k monitor isnt good certain game need clarity
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
weast maybe likely weast
west side money
nah youre reading wrong clearly meant say wasd
typical amerinacentric worldview smh chin jaapn also good money
better money heading south
guy east west kind money money going south forever
thing always go south
har far west california
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
believe im 75 ft 65 think considered okay still everything ive read everywhere youll never regret getting bigger tv house definitely would want 65 due already noticing pixel
upgrade different panel technology well think easy fooled resolution youre also upgrading oled something difference ppi 24 1080p 27 2k minor
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
believe better cheaper alternative understand personal preference
oh thats bad heavily considering 27 size 4k
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density look far away phone eye far monitor game distance 30cm yeah get 4k 24 monitor game chill mode 12m 1440p 27 enough getting pixel density wont recognizable anymore people
4k 60hz 24 inch several year ago loved monitor died warranty replaced 27 inch text clarity 24 inch awesome game looked great
general say homie opinion tho thanks input guess
also function distance screen
lie lol 32in 1440p zoom phone camera see pixel 27in 1080p definitely old one visible pixel
mean see pretty good see pixel 24 1080p 40 50cm dont mind lmao took eye test couple year ago bc mom already girl working thought itd funny tried
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
rock fellow old head ive actually never heard edpi make sense something calculate thanks
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
may weird subpixel arrangement idk ive compared mine native 1080p monitor size youd hard pressed determine one native image quality alone said like 1080p 27 monitor look good compared 4k anyway dpi low personally find sweet spot 1080p around 24 4k 32 monitor actually offer 27 24 scaling mode displaying 1080p ill often use instead much prefer option 1440p
1440p demanding gpu new game 23 year time even case also use monitor nintendo switch also play older game 1080p maximum resolution supported anything else either doesnt scale properly crash entirely plenty case might required render 1080p
guess really depends ur playing ur gunna playing 1440p rarely 4k think u j miss 4k buy 1440p monitor split evenly u could consider 4k
sure im saying huge difference
deleted
honest 4k 1080p 4k 1440p ok using small monitor since used console 4k60hz 55 downscaling 1080p worst experience pc like amd used 24hz month thought 60hz gpu put resolution like 4160p instead 3840p 36hz moved rx 7900xt rtx 3060ti came original computer upgraded traded rx7900xt samsung galaxy tab s9 12gb ram think 4k quite 1440p 2430 different 1080p dont misjudge wanted help think gaming good solution 1440p240hz playing extreme game 1080p240hz waste rtx 5080 extreme overkill 1080p would reach 400fps 1440p 5080 still overkill 5070 good since need render want 5080 might want monitor around 240hz 1440p never experienced 60hz think s9 ultra 120hz thought 60hz enough
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
feast money definitely retailer
yeah weasel money

34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
make difference program open stuff fit screen youre gaming getting 8k monitor would biggest waste money performance planet 1440p 27 inch monitor cant spot single pixel im playing used 4k 28 inch taxing gpu switched 1440p 27 inch literally tell difference
spot pixel density 27 monitor foot away 16ms v 4ms difference frame rate
eye cant detect 60 v 240 fucking lmao
yes point see pixel arm length monitor thats talking sit 2 meter monitor would probably look phone truly assumed going conversation people understand talking perceived difference image clarity
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
regular sitting distance 5060cm noticeable
length arm
maybe need glass dont know mate def see pixel tiny pixel still pixel 4k one use phone camera
go eye doctor autorefractor see good score ask auto readout put phoropter dont advanced system able read 23x faster glass auto prescriotion dont believe doctor say dont need glass everyone need doctor lazy shoot 2020 actually bad see 2016 without glass go 2010 glass normal eye doctor would turn away got designed ophthalmology machine

foot inch
dpi polling rate
thems sniper setting
adjust mouse sensitivity window setting well also gaming ingame sensitivity one person may 400 dpi 25 sensitivity another may 2000 dpi 5 sensitivity could effectively thing personally lean toward higher dpi lower ingame sensitivity keep outofgame speed consistent
also dpi kinda low 500 fair ig usually sit around 800 lower sen game feel better imo
eww gross pixelated cursor
like tiger baby
get smoooooooth mouse fuzzy text 4k240 smoooooooth mouse text
absolutely
ya really depends setup computer monitor game course user personally cant stand certain game others dont mind especially im back screen remember wide screen monitor came everyone like 43 life still appreciate good 43 older game server rack us havent daily driven one since fallout 3 came received nice 169 monitor released havent looked back 4k hdr later tldr hard go back never experienced better youll never know missing
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
happy cake day
woman make bread yeast thats kinda like free money
nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
thats set pihole
totally get model might fail others dont yeah agree angry costumer spend lot considering luxury necessity people would want make sure someone hears voice product go bad quickly opinion tho based yeah cant argue tv might bad fill house gaming monitor became stupidly cheap dont want smart tv functionality considering already got apple tv better mean see point personally recently 2 tv die sony 46 samsung 49 4k tho sony still got curved 65 work like champ hung wall 12 year lg thats never use still work around 12 year bought around time frame yeah one gave mom still work fine 15 year old 3 year tv could get driver license
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
think viewing distance youre using id wager youd hard pressed see much difference 1440p 4k gaming everything else going youd absolutely notice anything productivity related reading text etc personally use 48 4k gaming productivity complaint pixel density 1080p 24 1440p 32
look identical brother see 30 v 60 side side anything faster smooth guess know eye see better
checked monitor seems 45 time size sitting normal viewing distance holding phone normal viewing distance
22x amount pixel doesnt necessarily mean noticeable difference huge smaller pixel get get diminishing return noticeable 720 1080 22x increase much bigger visual difference compared 1440 4k would even say upgrade 1080 1440 noticeable 1440 4k despite 1440 175x amount pixel 1080
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
thanks live third world country lmao advanced medicine faaaar away dream wish could tho also thanks educating subject

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
ran 800dpi forever saw graph input latency different setting switched 1600dpi halved game sen noticeable difference reaction time latency 1600dpi didnt drop much course window sen lowered know guy running like 20000dpi lowest sen every game clue played way
one time foreign chick texted dont waist time
welp learn something disgusting everyday
mean funny live long enough time point stuff childhood people saying dont build quality thing anymore used build quality thing thing forget stuff broke still see washing machine survived 20 year 90 stuff quality stuff 90 new trash say though everything excessive electronics inside way complexity make failure likely
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
yeah thats im saying use case far youre fucking locked one foot monitor youll notice distance youre 3 foot away chilling fine also notice text isnt super crisp absolutely fine doesnt bother since im using productivitytextwork edit notice difference
need get eye check legit issue cant see difference
fucking insane hear people noticing big difference 1440p 4k saying difference 1080p noticeable also weird hear 1440p 4k massive difference
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen

got ta say couldnt ever worded better exactly tho got ta add newer technology resource invested make suitable everyday use wed better state mean company specially everything revolves around excessive consumerism push new technology without proven reliable enough everyday product warranty date actually indicates expected lifespan like today ever recall became normal product whereas rare instance exclude ford pinto supposedly calculated price pay death lower recalling car put road
depends difference looking text productivity stuff far noticeable difference two gaming still noticeable enough justify huge performance hit imo
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
deja viu thread starting annoy difference massive demand good clarity get main priority guy enjoy thumb sized pixel
yes get people different use casespreferences sorry hear microscopic baby hand hopefully dont hold back much
ur truth get annoyed like hidden secret everyone else dont answer right
lmao good one bro laughed reading awesome high ppi monitor
thanks think honest cant really read saying since letter screen 5 pixel
gpu work fine even 40905090 would 14900k issue intel cpu general still among powerful cpu gaming workload yes wont hit high fps number 9800x3d certain situation normal gameplay low re 1080p nearly visible
yeah im playing 1080p low re know 9800x3d performs better game mostly 3d cache wanted intel saw benchmark difference gpu based game around 20fps much wanted know cpu gpu combo fine
honestly 5070 somewhat overkill 1080p 1440p budget level card said itll work 1080p fine youll high frame rate basically game youre gon na try likely
tbh bought 360hz 1080p year ago im fortnite semi pro idk call like 1000 earned played fortnite time didnt need 1440 higher wont use im break fortnite wanted play amazing story game thats im playing 1080p
youre upgrading gtx 1080 rx 7800 xt 7900 xt give huge performance boost 7900 xt powerful youre looking better value 7800 xt still crush game high setting budget allows go 7900 xt want save cash still get great performance 7800 xt solid choice
pretty good 7900xt last longer sure though 20gb vram make pretty future proof
also ryzen 5 3600 recently upgraded 6800 xt cs2 get 150200 fps setting wan na play high refresh upgrade better cpu get gpu
went 1070 7800xt performance difference insane
good point reckon price drop 8000 series released im kinda fence im wary price wont drop rumored new amd gpus wont offer 7900xt performance
yeah thought exactly thanks
yeah gpu running 95 whilst cpu 58 upgrading gpu make sense
yeah there good chance price drop 8000 series come especially rx 7900 xt 7800 xt since new gpus compete youre rightif amd 8000 series doesnt beat 7900 xt performance might force massive price drop could also see deal retailer try clear stock make room new card youre rush waiting week 8000 series launch could give better deal youre really looking solid upgrade 7900 xt 7800 xt still offer great performance price come comfortable waiting potentially seeing price drop
youre right im hurry whatsoever gtx 1080 still hold well convinced wait bit longer thanks
got waiting bit could definitely save cash another upgrade gtx 1080 still solid card rush
hey thought ryzen 7 9800x3d amazing cpu might overkill depending use gaming 1440p 240hz probably wont need much power 7800x3d even ryzen 9 7900x would give killer performance without going crazy youre also planning heavy multitasking content creation streaming 9800x3d could still worth considering pure gaming overkill 1440p rtx 5080 gpu would definitely handle 1440p 240hz issue like cpu might overkill gaming resolution rtx 4070 ti rtx 4080 would give excellent performance without pushing hard price want something futureproof 4080 good gpu especially 1440p high refresh rate suggested combo cpu ryzen 7 7800x3d ryzen 9 7900x excellent gaming 1440p gpu rtx 4070 ti rtx 4080 either easily handle 1440p 240hz ram youve already got great ram 32gb 6000mhz perfect gaming multitasking
think amd gpus looking review much costeffective term performancecost rasterization feel need use rt although rt core must included game second thing futureproofing want similar situation laptop almost 7 year work great far although feel lacking aspect got x870 motherboard futureproof last thing still hesitating 9800x3d computer last many year although also thinking 9600x 2x cheaper 9800x3d
dont really look budget dont like overpay necessary know mean
youre cpu bottlenecked bottleneck calculator rubbish 40 load gpu mean couldve generated 25 time frame werent bottlenecked cpu likely cpu ram swap count towards cpu load way improve usage update cpu best case scenario 95 gpu load cpu load irrelevant cause game dont peg core time
say game requires minimum 16gb ram try closing stuff background free ram also track ram usage 90 probably ram edit actually recommended requirement still check whats usage
quick google search seems like squad 44 single core optimized game doesnt utilize 1 2 core therefore core wont utilized improve fps get faster single core cpu something like ryzen 5 5600x sure cache help case 5700x3d would way go another option would increasing setting higher gpu utilization keep way long fps high enough upgrade p mean 20 bottleneck use bottleneck calculator case useless
see certainly cpu limited without core maxing httpsyoutube6qgntlgufn0siadneoky1ortdi
deleted
cpu single core usage doesnt go 60 full game empty game though sits 90 giving 120fps shouldnt using power full game empty game
checked ram 10gb usage
already play maximum setting noticed pretty weird thing hop empty game gpu cpu usage skyrocket 90 know empty game fps lower cause nothing happening use power empty game full one checked single core full game dont go 60
noticed ram running 2133mhz instead 3600mhz docp enabled bios though problem
unfortunately 1080p monitor driver date observed another issue addressed reply comment post thought
think nowadays window maybe even lower stack bios level balance load core one core overheated others dont anything single thread load 4 thread cpu example look like 25 loaded core load shift fast enough task manager notice one core sitting 60 might still mean cpu bottleneck
really look like cpu bottleneck httpsyoutubecomshortsg3at0smjs6asik0hmhnwncopcsm3x
idea
yeah hammer performance greatly running 2133
idea whats problem
really clock automatically enable oc profile bios could try updating bios newest version see work
nothing changed
sure maybe try drop frequency bios notice register
im kind surprised cheaper amd card even cheaper 7600 7600xt also b580 price area
yeah im kinda surprised thing price around pretty weird area really high import price certain event really depends demand gpu example b580 priced around 389 4060 gigabyte 320 4060 actually cheaperit happens priced similarly due local market work demand gpus make price fluctuate lot one thing pay isnt always card value whats available people willing pay locally
well dang 4060 best best 4060 weird fast enough 1440p long play graphic setting becomes memorylimited quickly
yeah exactly 4060 best option ive got right 1440p know itll fine long tweak setting bit memory limitation definitely something keep mind price need best balance im expecting ultra setting every game think itll handle throw wanted take advice people plus im still upgrading part setup ill make ive got
dont need cap monitor hz match fps monitor refresh rate hz fps independent monitor 500hz youre getting 350fps monitor still display 350 frame per second wont waste extra hzit refresh often ensuring smoother visuals lower input latency fact keeping monitor maximum hz beneficial still reduce screen tearing input lag even fps doesnt fully reach refresh rate however experience screen tearing dont use adaptive sync like gsync freesync might want enable vsync cap fps slightly maximum frame rate minimize
thanks alot ur explanation

best option nut remove gpu get m2 nvme slot otherwise id sooner get sata ssd external one
get nvme drive never removed gpu like easiest part build
save money get nvme drive need help feel free dm
confident removing gpu try bringing cpu store install ssd
m2 cheaper faster super easy take gpu install one watch video peace mind trust
reason wouldnt work especially easy steam put new steam library make sure add storage option doesnt show steam game installed way different installs way make sure enclosure support uasp setup secondary drive external nothing would change done plug drive also full format thorough smart test update firmware applicable get drive hopefully catch issue early make sure drive running smoothly learned hard way new ssd multiple bad sector eventually causing crash corrupt data
gona blocked gpu cant put
answer
problem isnt removing gpu gpu big block adjacent pci slot cant put nvme pci 2nd slot
put gpu
put back obviously
httpsyoutubeec5gqhqbqdmsisoadmpfa0tslnqq
bro talking nvme slot already o talking pci slot nvme go blocked gpu httpswwwamazoninsabrentnvmepciealuminumecpciedpb084gdy2pwhttpswwwamazoninsabrentnvmepciealuminumecpciedpb084gdy2pw
put different slot dont slot thats mother board issue whats issue exactly
slot blocked size 4080 gpu
thats answer blocked gpu dont another slot beneath luck mobo
b450m ds3h
better use external ssd game
reviewing board way may work use riser cable micro atx board gpu whats limiting pcie lane there nothing short getting smaller gpu different motherboard riser cable fitting behind gpu possible idk thats going work nvme edit alternatively get sata ssd isnt huge difference speed get gen 5 nvmes use 2 nvme 1tb 2 sata ssds 2tb
hard disk slot full slot ssd
using hdds swap sata ssds samsungs app copy hard drive sata m2 variant simplicity new game coming require ssd minimum hard drive last longer ssds
apc wellknown reliable brand good choice sure pc running within 500w maybe need powerfull unit like 1050va
depends much power pc whatever else want connect like monitor draw
csn go 1000w guess average didnt look much im running
ive nothing mesure sadly cant tell much pc 2 monitor consume
momemt power outage pc must within range time shutdown example chatting reddit 200w 850va enough shutdown rush
thermalright phantom spirit
whats temp saying thermally throttling compared benchmark result average target 9700x ask think cooler fine chip ryzen chip designed run hot possible pretty much time boost clock long arent actually losing lot performance high temp fine unless truly hitting like 100 really getting hot try thermalright phantom spirit frost commander believe best air tower im sure either hugely different though would also concerned cooling setup case large issue getting enough air removed case
version configuration see multiple one picture see online ram get covered fan standard pushpush configuration
adding im idiot thinking wrong noctua model yes u12s probably enough cool chip either tower mentioned better believe cutout bottom fin stack allow ram clearance well check
im hitting 85c thats limit ive set bios ive compared benchmark im average think average calculated result system may may pbo enabled im sure im comparing system setting also correct assuming cooler work harder make better use 85c getting performance
also cooling setup positive pressure dust 3 intake 120mm fan front one 140mm exhaust fan back case thermaltake view 71 tg
look like enough ram clearance theyd cover rgb ram know sound stupid paid led id like show
certain extent yes course like scale infinitely cooling put onto setting chip 85 thats already standard ryzen operating temperature could bump 90 get bit performance average feel like current cooling solution fine
going rough time finding air tower isnt going stick ram slot want upgrade cooler essentially need dual fin stack air tower physically always take space referring buy thermalright 240ml aios much air tower least u look using aio build space dont like much
im looking review tom hardware scythe mugen 6 black edition similar performance better deepcool 4 deepcool iv thermalright phantom spirit 120 doesnt cover ram slot may go even single stack opinion id also rather go aio one die wasnt good experience
yeah totally agree aio point dont like use either air tower basically run forever need replace fan point dont opinion cooler really heard good thing scythe brand recommend cooler actually seen depth benchmarking usually recommend thermalright stuff find benchmarking yt tech review website actually prof stand relation current cooler seems worth would say go make sure dimension fit case single fin stack im sure much better without ridiculously tall since air cooler generally work based much metal fin stack much air blow across metal dissipate heat much heat dissipate given amount metal hopefully make sense
read reviewhttpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentsaircoolingscythemugen6andmugen6blackeditionreview tom hardware comparison cooler deepcool assassin 4 two stack signgle fan seems perform marginally better doesnt exposed fan able see make little anxious
seems pretty viable im sure massive upgrade current cooler definitely upgrade seems like may also quieter
problem im comparison cooler old dont find comparison modern cooler also cooler cant see fan dangerous exposed one cant visually see fan failure
technically yeah something would super worried people setup sitting floor day would never even see fan failure visually anyway likely way find would cpu getting hot thermally throttling would apparent soon tried play game dead cooler fan performance tanked
something im likely missing long enough damage cpu
nah modern cpu really hard accidentally damage thermally throttle instead meaning get hot enough keep downclocking performance create less less heat heat keep rising shut entirely would notice bad performance well even shutdown unless repeatedly little chance damaging cpu
got idea much performance would lose running two stack cooler single fan middle like thermalright phantom spirit 120 evo middle fan would solve ram issue run better single stack two fan leaf space improvement decide upgrade ram
im honestly sure would look see anyone documented im sure somebody tried ive never seen anything single fan might hard time pulling air one fin stack pushing air one might get loud fan ramp hard still double fin assume would better single fin stack setup genuinely sure
decided im gon na get thermalright phantom spitir 120 evo test one fan decide
sure resolution set mirror well extend desktop even doesnt mater
doesnt matter pc work using old 720p tv picked thrift store 20 buy power supply second monitor quite awhile gaming friend 17in screen believe 1080p 24in monitor primary
cringe bigger one second monitor
bother see
aesthetic technical problem
wise man say kill part cringe kill part cringes
27 inch isnt good size 1080p pixel density thing generally 27 inch better suited 1440p bear mind id get 1440p 27 inch swap main monitor use 24 inch second hardware allows obviously get another 24 inch screen otherwise say fuck hook whole tv lol
hardware handle quit good thing dont want speed lot money ant monitor looking get 180hz downgrading 240hz think would quit lot
wont notice much difference 180hz 240hz maybe competitive fps title thats
think idk live country good
get 40704070super instead
mb forgot add post edited
worth valorant would almost recommend 3060
unfortunately budget since cheapest could find 595
would get 4060 see find amd gpu cuz rx 7700x similar price put better vram
3060 horrible old
thank
need new one overpriced
rx 7700xt even better 4060 ti soo try find beast excellent

dont see upgrading next 4 year asus prime 750w 80 gold atx 30 good perchance found cheaper price others mentioned also seen people recommend 850w 4070 super safety purpose pay extra 850w psu thanks advance
good idea short time period definitely dont year lot product release price change happen year youll end buyer remorse save money instead
wary warranty period buy product year long warranty take year get rest part may playing something go wrong really dont see point buying separately youre going using anyway bother
easier return bought return store buy spread way test may part falling outside store return policy deal manufacturer bigger pain deal part working also look used prebuilts probably snag used workstation drop ssd used gpu like rx 580 setup easily done 200 let play game today lowendgaming subreddit fairly common wealth information way something working gather fund use cheap workstation temporary base buy ssd gpu want transplant custom build youre building nothing stopping selling workstation served purpose help recoup cost
component youre u amazon prime day black friday generally time good sale historical low part price youre going buy part ahead time would thing like case fan honestly like know look youre going buy specific part sale use historical pricing data like pc part picker camel camel camel even might change mind decide like new case like fan design better future
thanks answer
temp completely fine much better old situation old paste fully also huge deal still relatively fresh problem come old paste already dry thus creating air pocket
going single tower double tower 6 pipe good move dont know anything question expected tolerance heat hardware result compare reviewhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen77700x25html im sure given set seems entirely reasonable ask think also log usage time example im sure often need crank cinebench synthetic test real life application temperature context habit adjust
paste less week old l hope thats issue havent done anything like oc uv yet changed fan curve spin faster earlier appreciate help
oh fair enough anything temp better review dont use cinebench often wanted push limit thanks help
yeah likely issue also cinebench multicore almost cooling setup
also normal shader caching game rise temp usually reach mid high 80 barely touched 90
yeah thats normal shader compiling go 100 cpu get done fast possible comparable cinebench multicore
funny

last thing think super hard build
read motherboard manual watch least one stepbystep guide beginning end preparation take time dont freak something doesnt work immediately sure succeeed rocket science extremely careful motherboard socket insert cpu removing cover thats really one step mess stuff bending pin aside computer hardware brittle use common sense youll fine
thank much help
itll work isnt much upgrade depending live find lot rx570580s cheap locally
wouldnt risk plugging gpu generic psu get reliable 550 watt psu
want save used rx 6600 probably also check aliexpress rx 6600
every garbo psu nowdays ovp ocp fails trip ovp ocp fail motherboard protection even gpu protection budget changing psu isnt option
get 5080 line upgrade cpu yes overkill time upgrade whole system catch
course applies last genrtx 4000 would think decade old hardware would new one
u go 40 50 u upgrade part compulsorily need upgrade ur cpu ur mobo u go 40 series u make 850w psu even tho thats enough 50 series well would recommend getting 1000 w atleast coming gpu 50804080 70 40 series job almost always depends u looking wouldnt recommend spending much 5090 unless u really actual use case u go 4090 instead personal recommendation pricebest performance 4070ti
buy unknown gpu older model tested speak wait 50 series approved still would go older gpu better value money
5080 fine 1440p max setting 4k reduced setting
4070 5070 unless youre trying get 4k id say 5080 overkill
5070 ti might something look vram 4080 5080 performance cost less look like good card
depends game want play want play game bit older 7900xtx want play game releasing future would get 4080 super 5080
people disappointed 50 series expected kind miraculous new performance benchmark instead performance 40 series equal price core count want powerful stuff thats 50 series youre upgrading 10 series pretty much anything huge upgrade nevermind raytracing thats becoming requirement
considering fact youre still old hardware mean upgrade per decade said go highest end stuff afford
nvidia geforce rtx 5080 best gpu get unless go crazy rtx 5090 earth hear rtx 5080 would substantial upgrade thats crazy going 1070 5080 probably 4x5x multiplier maybe even rtx 5080 definitely recommended route go im running rtx 4070 ti super dont much reason upgrade money issue absolutely would go 5080 5090 latest generation nvidia tensor core 5000 series massive improvement 4000 series lot people dont take account evaluating performance difference one important factor
gpus worth theyre asking day chance hard time finding 5080 1000 msrp someone telling upgrade 1070 5080 isnt substantial flatout crazy
get best gpu fit budget need
amd rx 6800 average 350400 dont say budget pair nicely cpu got
kind gpu pretty severely limited old cpu likely wont get high fps remotely modern game id consider cpu upgrade along gpu likely gon na skyrocket upgrade cost new cpu mean new motherboard new ram least 5080 pretty high end card going 1070 even 40704070ti super better would significant upgrade
4090 ti budget isnt problem option go team red keep getting competitive price
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build im
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
1440p max setting overkill 2080 run game 1440p high setting 40705070 would better option
ive already got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d 5090 abit budget
6800 xt good card dont know ops budget feel bit silly pair best gaming cpu market 2 generation old midhigh end card
100 get 7800xt wouldnt spend 350 500 6800
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
set congratulation mate wish enough money upgrade like
yea thats good pairing pair am5 mobo amd expo ram u good u waiting 50 series stock might well wait ryzens new line processor eye 9950x3d
depends high many fps want
whatever best thats next 5080 amd want wait whatever else
perform worse actually
well youre pretty much set monster lol
thanks year making fair
nothttpscdnmoscmsfuturecdnnet3buqtn5dzgqi7zl8xs4wulpng also better upscaling framegen capability ai accelerator 6800 xt
think im worried future proof card 16gb vram cant afford 5090
5080 thinking 4080 super 1015 according leak last long long time mate 16gb vram sure couldve 20 24 peace mind thats nvidias segmentation 16gb still gon na fine 1440p even 4k least year vram capacity becoming important nowadays bad people make yet
okay ryzen 7 9800x3d 5080 future proof good
4090 5090 powerful setup could currently build yeah pretty much
okay thanks think wanted clarification
first glance everything look like fit though mentioned cpu cooler overpriced 6core cpu like 5600x significantly cheaper arctic freezer 36 would suffice want make sure enter individual component pcpartpicker make aware potential issue httpspcpartpickercomlist
weirdly enough built pc almost exactly like debated msi motherboard asus prime b550ma wifi ii ultimately chose asus lot people issue msi like random reboots say asus potential heat issue 5600 bing 65wt totally fine far issue
alright thank
u would build like httpspcpartpickercomlist2d3prm sama 360 lcd cpu cheaper aio display q80 overpriced would go newer b850 ice price faster rgb ram better ssd dont get crucial p3 plus good added yeston 4070ti super due cooler saving case 850w enough
sadly im u im australia pcpartpicker still work sadly yeston 4070ti super available ebay everything else get pcpartpicker
httpsaupcpartpickercomlistybnrzp ah thats bummer couldnt find except aliexpress seller look fine cost amount 4080 super worth opinion
im considering xfx quicksilver magnetic air radeon rx 7800 xt 16gb understand grade 4070ti super quite bit also lot cheaper far know plenty good enough want
go
cpuz free software display info chip actually pc easy way see actually got something counterfeit benchmarking tool look something like cinebench want look compare score number there lot tool like testing cpu
actually think youre gon na get legit cpu really cheap huh interesting test could use cinebench r23 example compare known legit result
run cinebench see stack 5700x3ds get similar single multi core score displayed correctly bios fine
super pi 7zip cpuz
generally run passmark benchmark suite anything build
3dmark demo passmark cinebench testing aside main benefit 5700x3d would require powerful gpu really work also game benefit l3 cache come raw cpu gpu performance fps end run gpu limit wont magically generate frame x3d running lower end low mid tier card wont much uplift think different story 4090 like test potential hardware part pretty much wasted dont power back would comparison 3080 depending actually playing might neither worth risk upgrade httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhd8vcmcmepahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhd8vcmcmepa
cheap really cheap like cheaper regular ali price link seller pm allowed interested new cpu lot experience ali could give opinion legit
yeah good point 6700xt isnt exactly insane anything entirely possible want upgrade upgrading sake also 5800xt amazon like 170 close faster maybe enough matter

try lossless scaling first
also eye snagging one site dismissed shop though many review credibility score low pretty sure shop homepage say chinese ship u idk though whole site sketch
know really hard say know szcpu supposedly legit stock course ton seller use image szcpu image freaking sketchy
yeah im honestly thinking getting 5700x amazon newegg upgrade 5600g call day im afraid spending money sketch website wait week get nothing something doesnt work
amazon 5800xt 159 right seems like solid deal need upgrade even amazon sketchy sadly
thanks tip eh ive heard 5800xt run really hot need double tower cooler barely performance 5700x amazon need check 3rd party seller lol
yeah heard well already thermalright pa120 keep 5600x 60c playing helldivers 2 figure able handle one cpu problem super awesome little cooler less 40
think youre right go 5700x3d
may missed boat 5700x3d hard find stock anywhere
dont think need upgrade game play anything switching 5 5600 cpu
5700x3d route would go would argue tier performance 7600 7700 less expensive drop upgrade need spend go am5 dont new build would make argument even cheapest a620 board 65w tdp 7600 7700 nonx variant would way go potential future upgrade low tdp cpu reusing ddr5 another socket going low end board would make cost difference trivial thats case already am4 board
thanks wanted check get others opinion havent built pc year im quite loop new gen stuff plus main worry overlooking something others would quite obvious
hmmm country im uk pick one overclockers amazon 200 next day delivery
denmark local computer store 15 store tray version boxed
look like tape covering unused memory slot pcb dont know likely wasnt anything bad good
human assembled gpu made mistake shit happens like doctor leaving piece napkin tool inside body surgery
oh sorry forgot mention piece removed next screwdriver image covering two module ill edit post
may part packaging gpu assembled maybe heat sink paper base keep clean gpu assembly etc may also something like bit peel thermal pad apply
thats weird paper thin dont think would affect gpu temperature memory module would absolutely cooked tho
checkout price r5 5600x even r5 5600 faster gaming r7 5700 need save money also consider using stock cooler good enough always buy stronger cooler later want rx 7800 xt good card difficult recommend since rx 9070 xt right around corner bit risk card going lot better price still mystery decide wanted point rest part alright id probably recommend get motherboard least heatsinks since using low powered cpu fine anyways

ok
work fine 5700x3d equivalent ryzen 7600

game resolution use
rather buying 5700 go ryzen 5 7600x
1440p 144hz consider cheaper card 1440p 5070ti 5070 might close 3080 worth upgrade monitor thats limiting cpu case
see youre saying sensible thing buy 4k oledqled monitor fine twisted arm
1440p 144hz monitor played game total war warhammer 3 battlefield 1 5 age empire 4
clarify spec current build

4080s wasis 4k card performs exceptionally well 1440pthe 5080 bound faster since 4080s already surpasses httpsyoutubefyuz1cp4rnit311144fps many game 1440p 5080 even game making poor value choice
really technically efficient game wont utilize core cpu usually used heavy workstation server plus single core clock speed lower normal gaming cpu get normal cpu youre gon na game
someone ran xeon build necessity year cpu good gaming sure consumer cpu much better reason one said large amount small core good breaking workload game engine dont work way game want large core run dont know sc engine operates imagine us lot single core well extra core since built similarly sim game engine
two full x16 slot thing hedtserver hardware newer consumer platform youre gon na get x8x8 bifurcation best im sure much would affect llm performance case dont know much money sponsor gon na put ive seen success people running newer mac mini cheaper relatively way get larger model running could worth look minor edu discount im afraid help much ballpark calculation since knowledge llm limited
assuming limiting ai access single user per pc given time inferencing basically impacted lower pcie speed initial model loading onto vram take little longer reason heavy calculation done gpu gpu doesnt transfer data finished resulting work text reduced pcie bandwidth make real difference even tensor parallelism text data flow back forth lower pcie bandwidth doesnt make huge difference check rlocalllama subreddit similar subreddits find people using extremely old used xeon setup cost penny comparably focused dual 16x anything like make sure board spaced pcie 16x slot choice gpus fit also need buy high end psus recommending big tower recommend least 1200w 1200w enough connector 2x 3090 double check 3090 requires 3x cable instead 2x also help go 3090 fe also dont need lot ram still try get least 32 gb setup run 2500ish per pc used 3090 ti refurbished 800 microcenter 3090 little cheaper professional setup youd want allow multiple student access ai time mean youll purchasing expensive server hardware multiple pcie slot nvidias professional lineup like rtx ada card would run ten thousand dollar
well running 4 pc 1x 2070s right working fine many user thought get pc run 70b model principle still work
yeah mean concurrent active user per pc 70b need time llm spit answer may need adjust max concurrent user
much think professional setup would cost u

absolutely worth worksisnt scam
sound like great deal make sure proper psu required high end 6000 card draw lot power know amd recommends least 850w psu 6900 xt maybe someone used weigh
hope seller genuine provide testing warranty im kinda secure anything go wrong
using 5700x3d 750 psu watt problem
shouldnt warranty dead 4080 want upgrade disappointment shitwreck 50 series real option provides actual improvement 5090
5080 would perfect also info 7800x3d still 2nd best gaming cpu world
1yr old 4080s died either warranty claim something wrong pc done something covered warranty 50xx gpu work build 50 series pcie gen5 believe b650 asus strix model motherboard gen4 x16 slot unlike strix f e model b650e gen5 x16 slot whilst 50 series work gen4 dont know performance might affect edit suggests negligible effect httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscalinghttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscaling 5090 massive 575w wont due psu wattage probably enough 50xx gpu model would replace 4080s 3rd party tested benchmarkings arent released yet jan 30 likely 4080s lie 5080 5070ti 5080 rumored something like 15 take relative pricing
would 100 get 5080 money going slightly better support future tech might well grab 4080s cost
real question die worried want actually go 4070ti super readily available
4080 sad decision 5080 way cheaper dont make mistake ofc
warranty dont gpu stock anymore theyll return money need buy new one month price 4080s rose 1520
5080 better 4080 super sure similar price care someone consider disappointment
warranty claim ill get money back point need decide whether stick 40xx buy 50xx since coming thanks pcie info thing like exactly im sure whether get 50xx idea get 5080 pcie gen 4 work work full potential even worse 4080s
warranty claim dont technical detail store couldnt repair return money guess unlucky defective gpu
yeah 47 wouldnt call improvement fair
added link negligible performance difference pcie come price want pay 4080s quite cheaper moment compared release 5080 may vary country seems 3rd party seller likely mark upwards poorly 5080 msrp exaggerating price difference wait day see benchmark decide think price difference worth 5080 performance increase sure 5070ti considering release long may wait likely performantly less close 4080s guess part though price probably less similar current 4080s price
gpu there really good reason pas free performance
price would definitely call improvement especially dont gpu otherwise worth upgrade maybe
thank helpful
well look like difference 40 50 5090 negligible isnt even worth mentioning
there thing free performance nvidia already pulling low quantity gpus available launch bullshit there chance therell enough stock online store prevent scalping actual price closer 15001700 usd rather msrp
literally explain would buy 1200 dollar 4080s could buy better performing 5080 price scalping stupid argument plenty store said 5080 good supply price new 4080s
find 5080 price yes might well go however highly doubt 5080 cost
dont need next step would ddr5 6000mhz would require new motherboard would worth upgrading cpu well
maxxing ram
task manager generally accurate account every process system 3rd party apps may hook everything want know accurately go task manager cpu graph right click select change graph logical processor
yes task manager reliable cpu gpu much except temp running 1060 6gb 100 according nvidia software task manager said max 30 mostly gaming stayed around 15 usage incorrect far cpu usage go pretty reliable
ok game take 50 cpu usage even though already graphic card im referring wuthering wave 1080p
graphic card got cpu provide everything gpu render frame higher frame rate higher cpu load illustrated every cpu gaming review ever made
mean even though gpu 90 active game still requires cpu looking benchmark article youtube i5 12400f work 2030 high setting aaa game tried game
gpu isnt 99 pegged time cpu holding back game youre playing period end discussion isnt always possible achieve people within budget plenty game fastest cpu planet cant max nature game work

probably cpu bottleneck try pushing 1920x1440 crt 85hz
cpu thats problem upgrade x3d chip theyre quite good 1 low
cap framerate
msi afterburner lower 1 turn every monitor setting
1600x1200 reminds beginning year 2000
answer would need know game cpuram tried capping fps 95
yeah whats cpu game issue
5800x seems many game cant get decent frametimes anything 60fps nowadays new monster hunter cyberpunk weird stutter even though framerate consistent ect
5800x back impressed still able youre asking rest spec window 10 11

always use two stick single running slower 3060ti nice card upping 5070ti
yes
pcpartpicker wattage x13 good rule thumb fine
use pcpartpicker website help solve
yes plenty good unless youre something ab normal like running dozen old hdd odd etc
yeah calculated amount wattage use thats mean come like 476w people still saying risk wan na know sure wont mess setup
alright thank running 2 ssds 1 hdd shouldnt problem
yes enough thinking buying something reason change otherwise super solid
aight appreciate
lower fan rpm bios whatever feel acceptable
performance wise standard phantom spirit faster evo look better
phanteks say case support 360 radiator sitting top case case id change cooler 360 aio sitting top case thermalright make excellent value option look benefit cooling set fan quiet speed youll still cool cpu perfectly swap fan around rest case arctic p12s p14s significantly upgraded cooling case cheap
thats somthing need sort im case came fan hub 3 pin one full need change
look thing thought better fan somthing dont care look since window side desk
consider would make case fan exhaust worry would getting cool air gpu bit worried pumping much heat case rtx 3080 thats part weird setup year back case basically everything else different take side case summer overheating put 3 exhaust top used 120mm aio keep heat away gpu fix issue might relevant current build though
360 radiator would set exhausting air like current fan set rear fan exhaust put 2x120 fan front intake remove drive cage youre using setup plenty cooling want even cooling gpu space pci slot even 3d print something like httpscults3dcomdemodell3dgadget5slot80mmfanmountforpcpcislotcovershttpscults3dcomdemodell3dgadget5slot80mmfanmountforpcpcislotcovers httpswwwprintablescommodel6571314pcislot80mmfanhttpswwwprintablescommodel6571314pcislot80mmfan httpswwwprintablescommodel965999pcislotfanmount92mmfansupporthttpswwwprintablescommodel965999pcislotfanmount92mmfansupport use low rpm fan bring fresh air directly gpu
might worth shot using drive cage cant remove though reason use 120 fan intake front instead 140
intake air 2 fan v 1 fan
yeah support 2 x 140mm fan 200mm thats moment swapped 2 x 140 2 x 120
ah bad misread spec sheet lol quick mental math tell isnt much airflow difference 1 x 200mm fan v 2 x 140mm fan eyeballing picture case look like 2 x 140mm fan utilize space better less restriction case design provide static pressure overall 200mm fan also tend poor static pressure isnt great considering drive cage way
well yes enough wouldnt recommend especially bronze rating efficient
itll run back probably green screen load know get 1000 watt psu rig
wattage wise yes quality wise sure depends unit id looking upgrade higher quality necessarily higher wattage psu unless plan getting 90 series card future
1000w psu total overkill system less 400w power consumption full load lmao
like 500w 4080s us around 300w max 9800x3d use 150w multithreaded work load still stuff using bit power
overkill good
system requires roughly 430w full load r7 5700x3d msi b550m pro vdh mobo 32 gb ddr4 ram fractal design lumen s36 v2 aio 6 argb fan aliexpress 2tb wd pcie 40 ssd 6950 xt nitro jonsbo d31 mesh screen case dedicated 8 lcd screen expect 4080s run bit efficient 6950 xt op probably gon na powering separate screen psu
power usage value used got techpowerups review 9800x3d 4080s founder edition
yes monitor connected wall outlet say 750w enough dont money upgrade psu without downgrading important stuff
could go slight undervolt make sure anyways undervolt ftw

rtx 4070 super long get reasonable price
since mention vram would look 16gb card anything past couple generation smoke 970 bang buck 7800xt featurerich would 4070 ti super 4070 super great card limited 12gb vram really problem today since looking holding card long time targeting ultrawide screen would consider 16gb option
7900 gre option tends less expensive 4070 super good margin noticeable lead performance card overclocked point time im sure disappointment shitwreck 5070 even faster 4070 super rasterization almost 17 less cuda core 4070
cant beat value picked 4070s getting 130140fps iracing everything highultra 49inch ultrawide 1440p big upgrade 3060ti
would buy oldest one acceptable theoretically get bang buck would go either 3000 4000 amd try well
buy afford always new card 5070 come people ask wait ti super get afford
consider 7900gre well
7900xt beat
4070 super cope 1440p
thank
thank answer 4070ti super expensive im aware vram concern didnt know could make much difference playing ultrawide maybe ill look amd
okay wasnt aware 5070 much letdown wasnt considering 7900gre good 650w psu im bit worried might bit much seeing price buy new psu price difference maybe make sense need think thank
2nd ended getting 4070 super never even one problem play whatever want doesnt even flinch lol tried go cheaper vram amd ended problem luck draw suppose got tired headache troubleshooting went 4070 super best idea ever lol troubleshooting work 12gb def enough vram always turn setting little lost demanding thing anyway honestly cant even tell difference high ultra every setting
tried ac evo chance im playing ams2 really want jump evo 10 come im wondering good enough good experience
see 3080 selling 400usd given want last im sure going 2 gen back would 3080 meet requirement 5 year
totally get close launch maybe make sense thats im considering new amd card already far line consider could wait month 50 series

youre welcome clear dont think 12gb going problem 3080 12gb ultrawide run vram issue yet think 4070s viable option right 5 year road could different story looking gpu today take 2030 ultrawide panel would shopping 16gb vram
thank feedback rx470 8 year issue died got 970 strapped cash said think prefer 4070 paper feedback solidifies im trying think long term comment say 7800xt7900gre would last longer im pickle hard predict future guess haha
bought game tried 3060i struggling setting medium im gon na give 4070 try later still havent found good setting guide since game new
would recommend going mid end card 3080 last 5 year probably might able buy 2 3060 money last almost 8 year depends requirement would go good priced 3080 maybe 4060 good deal
thats main thing im considering reasoning framegen help inevitably gpu start enough see many mixed comment im sure much sense make
whats opinion going 7800xt7900gre course impossible know fact see 5070 benchmark based spec think 5070 potential better longer taking dlss account unless thats crap havent tried reviewer surely dont standard coming 1080p60
make sense think ill looking 7900gre nvidia option 16gb vram expensive im still hoping clearance 50 series start actually selling wont keep hope thank
thats big f
dont need force anything bios pcie standard backwards compatible put gen3 nvme ssd gen5 slot itll run gen3 speed ill honest wont notice difference gen4 gen5 normal use ssd gpu loss going gen5 gen4 5090 basically negligible within margin error kinda bandwidth speed wont fully utilized long yet ssd unless youre routinely working large file time gen5 speed felt edit read 40 riser 50 slot issue sound similar going 3040 transition id wait 50 riser come shouldnt issue problem happens slot 50 riser isnt guess forcing slot 40 mode would avoid issue yes dont think bios setting let specific downgrade one slot 40 itd global probably wont know sure check setting though
saw perfomance go lower 12 blue screen smth httpsyoutubeisfbwjltdr8si4bplr8tu28d7bzwk
gaming see advantage using gen 50 drive sata ssd unless gen 50 nvme good deal go gen 40 instead
going notice difference jayztwocents gamers nexus debauer also think paul hardware etc etc came conclusion difference gpu performance gen3 gen5 anywhere 15 anything youd actually ever notice unless time energy individually test compare result jtcs channel even made mistake regarding controlling ambient temp show graph showing 5090 getting marginally better performance gen4 v gen5 due temp variance literally nothing worry
cool thanks solution likely forcing gen 4 wait gen 5 riser revert default gen 5 new riser cable
honestly current riser separate purchase would insert gpu normally switch get gen5 included case disregard lol
personal suggestion would go ryzen 5 5700x3d motherboard support would add best used graphic card find mentioned 7600xt germany go 350 money could find 3070ti 3080 would much much powerful 3080 might pushing 650w though sure
u get 5700x3d think equivalent 7600 u dont spend money whole new motherboard ram u also upgrade 32gb ram along gpu upgrade
3070 ti 3080 available used market new piece available
guy surprised know cost india 20k inr thats reason creating lot confusion
yeah know suggestion would buy used card long test seller computer little risk course choice new id also check 4060ti
cpu cost id say since already am4 getting 5700x3d cheaper option bc 7600 requires new mobo ddr5 ram 5700x3d doesnt come cooler getting one cheaper like 250usd am5 upgrade

getting ryzen 7600x overpaying aio budget air cooler 3040 buck max work perfect cpu wasting lot money case fan ofc might worth wait rtx 5070 5070 ti
cheaper cooler cheaper equally good ram get rid dxpensive fan easily save 200 dollar
look way better tyvm worth go 6400 instead 6000 ram
need get x3d cpu since need cache specific game 7800x3d 9800x3d isnt 9800x3d good pick long run aircooler would u recomend well yes use gtx 1070 could wait 5070ti better
yeah lian li case fan combo neat thats good chunk money wasted fan probably get three pack arctic corsair rgb fan price one infinity aio arctic half price id rather spend little extra motherboard maybe power supply op want future proof bit
really plenty youtube video testing want know
game requires x3d cpu doesnt exist yes might better performance regular cpu also strong besides guess either 1440p 4k screen considering getting 4070ti super higher go resolution smaller stress put onto cpu gaming 5070 probably wont better 4070ti super thank nvidia 5000 series dlls4 multi frame generation could useful play aaa game speaking air cooler one great price httpspcpartpickercomproducthyxrsythermalrightpeerlessassassin120se6617cfmcpucoolerpa120sed3httpspcpartpickercomproducthyxrsythermalrightpeerlessassassin120se6617cfmcpucoolerpa120sed3

ryzen 5 3600
ak fine also good case airflow temp check wo side cover close flow ok
ye case awful dont know one get need within certain size fit recommendation
look one 3 front top fan hole along 1 rear 3 front use restrictive cover make look nicer avoid p seen pretty cheap one fit pcpartpicker
thats never empty check show hidden file folder property see hidden normal user
would want
yes safe make sure show hidden file turned may empty appdata folder store data program game save sometimes application like discord browser etc deleting file folder dangerous may cause inconvenience case example delete save game start app specific data like setting many program game leave unnecessary junk file appdata uninstalled file longer needed even reinstall program game later safely delete folder related program longer installed long doesnt contain saved data youd like keep case reinstall program game future
like keep appdata always clean
hurting lot software
ryzen 9800x3d rtx 5080 rx 7900xtx great card 5080 would dlls4 multi frame generation would come hand lot 4k resolution
problem pricing 1000 sort cap gpu already feel uneasy anything 800 reason normaly went xx70 respective release
use machenikes g6 pro native rumble support
hardware handle 1440p gaming samsung odyssey g5 could way go versatility higher resolution solid contrast care refresh rate color accuracy resolution xiaomi g27i would work well
im gon na say one thing went 1ms va panel 1ms ip panel motion clarity way better ip dont think id ever go back va ip panel got hdr mini led way brighter last monitor expensive colour actually better even though ip wont go monitor something consider best thing say read lot review monitor see there issue weigh important write pro con table might make decision easier choosing good monitor hard good luck
1440p way
entirely sure hardware confidently handle resolution however game capped ay 60 fps time cap intentionally doesnt matter mostly play soul like game among thing like nier automaton spider man remastered
aware motion clarity color saw one youtuber testing samsung 92 srgb trying figure extra resolution worth tradeoff use case never really used extended period time
dlss rescue favour get 1440p try want go back bte va pallnels good choice strength weaknesseses ip
like game run 60 fps sometimes cap frame rate purpose samsung odyssey g5 1440p resolution give immersive visually pleasing experience without stressing hardware much strike nice balance performance visuals especially storyheavy goodlooking game plus va panel better contrast really boost overall look youre still sure well itll perform certain game try testing 1440p current setup connecting external display one see hardware cope decide
deciding make sure check potential issue like software driver problem ddr5 help futureproofing might improve multitasking wont fix performance problem theyre due software issue instead hardware limit
yeah budget wise 57x3d really bad option esp since hard find 98x3d msrp 3080 4080s seems lot esp 50 close
thats instruction told hook fine
im assuming
recommend following instruction make sure right
saw nvidia stopped sending update see
didnt still supported latest driver driver support go far back 900 series
nvidia ending update 10 series older professional cuda driver support gaming driver still provided youre fine
3060ti still great job even 1440p even run space marine 2 dlss 7080fps go mediumlow newer game 1080p itll great
2060 well might say 1060 starting get outdated
course technology get dated super fast considering uplift performance quality dlss latest implementation youre losing decent amount performance latest rtx 50 series card know
good card course youre talking playing 1080p without question 12gb card could manage game 1440p really depends gamerez youre playing since nvidia still sending update awhile youre good 20 series phased need think support series end soon
1070 still get update lol
people keep asking quesion like still good gpu depends use case right mean gt 640m 10 year ago still ok daily minecrafting
fine 1080p plenty pf people playing new game much worse card 4060 8gb worse lol 2 year old
deleted
ok saw whole article say 30 series likely discontinued future 50 series release
planning playing game 1080p 1440p monitor
recently played ghost tsushima max setting fsr else dropped 35fps
production support
theyre winding manufacturing support
note article mean nvidia stopping making new 3060 chip doesnt mean longer providing driver update 40 series already discontinued except 4060 4050 laptop also doesnt mean nvidia isnt providing driver update either dont worry
try avoid generally look pretty bad prefer go low setting try make 1440p work 60fps
turn medium
ok got thank
zotac 40 series share problem fan use shit fan noisy stand noise ok otherwise
try rbuildapcforme subreddit specialize sort thing edit link kept working
let gpu biggest upgrade lol budget
something like 500 less
probably rtx 5060ti 16gb release 16gb vram variant whenever u get hand one
cpu 5700x3d gpu wait new generation amdnvidia bad thing gpu hitting 100 gaming fact indicates gpu fully utilized mean youre getting performance 2080s still pretty solid card wait new gpus get released
upgrade cpu tho gaming sometimes get graphical problem fps drop thought id need upgrade thank
upgrade cpu tho dont need 5700x3d last longer wont bottleneck cpu demanding game graphical problem fps drop mean artifacting probably mean gpu dying faulty however fps drop different matter reinstalling driver using ddu checking component resolve issue likely mean gpu faulty
alrighty thanks
try turning freesyncgsync doesnt work likely monitor faulty
dual channel 2x16 faster single channel 1x32 ram slot typically numbered 0 1 2 3 4 dimm slot motherboard want run 2 stick 4 slot board would place slot 0 2 slot 1 3 placing 0 1 2 3 placing wrong spot dual channel ram motherboard user manual info interested
able use slot 1 3 continue using 2x 16gb set technically could issue ram overclock difference really extreme overclocking world record speed
okay one slot isnt working leaving 3 others running 1 stick 3 slot 2 still capable enabling dual channel dont want single stick use case dual channel ram give performance v single im confused youre asking even problem based youve written
one stick two stick ddr5 behave since single stick run dual channel basically less ram running 1x 16gb stick instead two
op talking ddr5 single stick dual channel two stick give two dual channel stick wont get bandwidth increase two stick ddr5 like ddr4 quad channel exist workstation cpu make use
xmp disabled automatically pc noticed wasnt running two stick removed battery reseated meaning reset bios setting slot 1 3 refuse make pc boot mobo relies slot 2 4 want boot function properly
first build pc put ram first third slot made pc want boot reason try run first third slot see boot let know went edit nope seems like mobo relies channel 2 4 want two stick ram
im thinking buying cheap mobo handle component sending one claim see store tell issue otherwise ill say fuck go single 32gigs thanks answer
didnt say said slot 4 wasnt working anyone supposed know first put part together issue didnt say case dont one faulty slot one working one newly purchased motherboard still warranty get replaced
didnt say thought wasnt issue normal thing motherboards want run two ram huh guess learn something new everyday thanks

consider good subjective screen planning screen always first choice give target build towards need better part 4k v 1080p
seperate issue
1500 pc monitor httpspcpartpickercomlistltrpkq am5 platform 20gb vram 32gb ram motherboard extra slot ram m2 165hz 1440p monitor
separate issue 1500 need cover tell u whether
lmao yeah ive got everything keyboard less concerned price decent pc
fit fine case like 28l massive sffpc world reference roughly 3 time volume ghost s1 matx itx lot space play
originally going use 25 ssd ill use 2 lexar m2 ssds one o one program game input always welcome
holy shit ghost s1 compact boy im brightest come part think significant bottleneck one part im thinking upgrading ram future 3200mhz

everything look great there ton room saving since white build would go thermalright frozen prism aio 56 compared 80 peerless assassin also white aio rgb would also go wd sn850x sure sale canada right sale america 14999 save 20 storage gain dram maybe go gigabyte b850 aorus elite wifi7 ice instead x870 ice version dont really need extra m2 slot mobo post code would save 50 maybe go something like antec c5 argb 109 right would save 40 case another dual chamberfish tank type case
wow bundle actually look great thanks much suggestion ill look
thank much suggestion ill look sure
httpsitpcpartpickercomlistsbyf4p get cheaper efficient 7600 cheaper cooling solution 7600 65w cpu affordable motherboard ram 2tb storage instead 1tb bit slower noticeable though 4070ti super instead cheaper case better psu price performance
thanks reply got point question mobo wifi since difficult connect ethernet cable dont care 2tb storage always put future need would get 2tb slower faster 1tb upgrade future air cooler enough clearence ram air cooler mind switch aio space clearence ram price 4070 ti super justify performance didnt see quite increase fps game increase price could wrong though thanks
1 yep wifi bluetooth 2 would still take 2tb version 3 yep enough clearance pcp cant check every motherboard every cooler remark always pop 4 yep definitely especially extra vram newer game thank paying nearly 800 12gb vram much would take 4070ti super 100150 day week
thanks ill look
would wait release test decide worth may find used 4070 ti anyway im looking forward buy new 5070 tbh
price little high used 4070ti
know generally used price entire 4070 series absolutely inflated right hope go bit 5070 arrives
would think enough hey year still warranty
since bit 4 year old maybe happens getting old
whichever case like better quite literally decision make
httpsukpcpartpickercomlistbgw22x would build like 7500f aliexpress 7500f7600 performance newer b850m motherboard affordable cooling solution faster ram better gpu 7900xt case better psu slightly expensive stronger gpu
none build suck trash mobo aio waste money ur budget ram relatively slow get 6000mhz cl30 amd expo lian li a3 owner im biased saw review thermalright psus would avoid gigabyte psu even tho one ok instead httpsukpcpartpickercomlistdmrjjnhttpsukpcpartpickercomlistdmrjjn better mobo allow u upgrade cpu fututre faster ram cpu u around 5fps less u save money u using stock cooler cpu run noticeable less hot sfx psu mandatory price nice better u picked storage
16gb ddr5 5200mhz ram neither
actually read spec 5200 doesnt show cl
man cant believe didnt see thank
youre man cant believe didnt see thank
problem
matter different mhz ram
better keep possible even manufacturer cl etc
try running gpuz background logging look spikesdips crashed also could hwinfo64
rx 550 4gb version
yep low profile one
rx 550 additional 2gb really help fyi rx 550 gt 1030 basically performance constrained vram
except gt 1030 2 gb think safe 200 watt power supply saw spec sheet suggested psu 250 watt im sure still power
200 watt power supply like low profile one see oem pc like dell
rest system look like edit yes i3 8100 isnt power hungry undervolt gpu want safe saw people i5 8500 180w psu run rx 550 problem
pcie slot compatible
also get ram 216gb decent ram would ideal cant get additional 8gb stick also window 10 going reaching eol end lf probably able get decent value used cpu upgrade
dont know check motherboard manual web
oki saw pcie x16 slot gpu compatible right
gpu 6 pin 8 pin power connector
low profile dont think 6 pin 8 pin power connector
check motherboard provide least 50w
httpsdepcpartpickercomlistg7h6sh would get ryzen 5600 rx 7800xt 630 amazon germany bit cheaper buying somewhere finland httpsfipcpartpickercomlistg7h6sh
hello welcome easiest common upgrade case upgrade cpu ryzen 5 5700x3d significant boost computer secondly 1070ti reaching endoflife expensive replace gpu price gone crazy sticking nvidia youd want upgrade least rtx 3070 4070 4070s expensive would personally recommend avoiding 4060tier gpus wish switch amd find good value rx 7700 rx 7800 level switch nvidia amd youll need run piece software called ddu flush nvidia driver stay behind cause problem amd video card vice versa switching amd nvidia ram easily upgraded later 32gb thats priority nice point first priority completed storage youre running near full ssds effect performance clear space deleting old gamesfiles buy 2nd ssd install space
there route go one want stay motherboard get either 55005600 new 5700x3d new aliexpress make sure reputable seller lot review also doesnt include cooler fyi upgrade gpu used radeon rx 67006750 xt 12gb vram 7800xt want 16gb vram could try nvidias gpus youll spending price per performance likewise ram decent long speed good maybe buy another 16gb little safer though entirely necessary depending configuration ie 1 stick 16gb 2 stick 8gb go whats already dont mix definitely upgrade storage 100gb barely anything one two price per gb crazy go standard ssd nvme m2 ssd slot go one though run hot could either buy heatsink theyre cheap check motherboard already heatsink use stickerlabel heatsink optimal worst lastly big one psu maybe importantleast thought component build settle whatever look review one seems good already great still research putting anything dont want fried make sure total wattage rest component also expensive doesnt equal best 80 rating misleading sometimes isnt scare inform
thank nationality obvious xd
thank much input
thank detailed answer ill start look processor aliexpress also bad making post 1t ssd idk would write 100gt
nope checked account immediately saw finland post
video editing normally want powerful cpu id suggest getting i7 i9 youre going keep motherboard think highest upgrade without swapping motherboards would i911900k motherboard psu
600w psi asus h510 prime
want look upgrading psu get newer powerful gpu asus h510 work easily intel 11th gen i7 i9 processor upgrading i3 i7 i9 almost certainly need better cpu cooler system came i7s i9s run hot
seems like either little nudge austerity measure latter much less fun isnt something like 3x gdp owed id careful calling something like unnecessary lest necessary necessitates need since gaming talking could always sell mobo go am5 less power draw similar better performance cheaper
feel like im minority opinion group buying second hand anything except psus really havent worried much market saturated lot 23 generation old gpus specifically ludicrously low price still deliver wonderful raw performance 10801440 even thing dire due tariff dont see used market getting crazy least pay play give peace mind money well spent
dont think intel exception end raw stuff chip come elsewhere added cost land consumer pray us extra money something benefit people know thats gon na go
decent rig wouldnt think much would enjoy game mistake would bought version 4060 ti 8gb vram
criticism adventure game repertoire includes da veilguard tbh rest post seems sensible
reluctantly splurged im currently 6 beer deep
enjoyed origin much havent gotten game yet whats big knock
played three game one origin definitely best two great compared one absolute masterpiece short writing character dogwater general combat boring puzzle braindead disclaimer didnt play veilguard watched quite bit gameplay
yeah passed last one watching gameplay thankfully read veilguard storyline based wanted give shot
jup would another option would 5700x3d aliexpress bit cheaper
resolution play cpu gpu bound gpu utilization percentage game
im mostly game developer need extra faster thread thing like compilation use 1080p 165hz display dont really care locked fast refresh rate though
yes case 5700x 5800x 5950x great motherboard currently using
title literally say b550m ds3h ac gigabyte rev 14 exact
apology missed 5700x 5800x fine wouldnt push 5950x though dont think power stage vrm cooling cope
put one aorus b650 thing need done bios update ensure compatibility also using 3 m2 drive gpu x16 lane aorus b650 pro ax
nope edit ill expand wont issue b650e board thing youll miss v x870 usb4 port
board come intel i225v nic notorious piece shit ever exist finding b650ee came instantly decided
thank much help
see thank much
whats
mean cpu way powerful gpu typically people spend like 13 budget gpu budget list random part playing triple game trying
7900 xt fine 650 7900 xtx 830 also fine though better pricetoperformance 4070 ti super currently overpriced 5070 ti better may good availability launch would save money ssd though get kingston kc3000 2tb 120 still considered highend gen 4 drive
look good overall personally would go performance orientated build like httpspcpartpickercomlistf8ztpj cpu better priceperformance cooler newer cheaper x870 motherboard less lane ssds still enough 34 ssds cheaper ram better price performance ssd 7900xtx sapphire pulse sale newegg cheaper case pre installed fan better airflow psu overall 100 buck cheaper fps
resolution plan gaming game play budget
1440p2160p max setting 60120 frame game 9800x3d gpu selected perform 120 fps max 2160p also dislike nvidia amd gpu really option unless find 4080 ti super deluxe omega whatever like 750 cpu future proof amd drop better gpu could march know
also triple becoming lost term recent year main game see monster hunter wild stalker 2 re4 remake space engineer 2 maybe splash ark survival ascended also play alot early access title unoptimized mess
agree also looking msi 2tb ssd decent speed 109 atm already 1tb samsung 990 gon na move new build
also opinion beware brand relevant gpu manufacturer
appreciate time ill buying everything microcenter long stock component appreciate alternate option
1440p minimum max setting aiming 60120fps 2k monitor assuming thats 2160 unless 4k sure difference play everything honestly atm pubg playing monster hunter wild stalker 2 re4 remake space engineer 2 budget 225k usd max aiming rgb obviously got glass side panel see bit bob thing
personally would go 4080 7900 xtx bang buck 4k gaming 9700x find cheaper reason liking nvidia besides liking pick whats best need price performance
go budget left incase gpu expensive msrp also might require 31 fan splitter cable 9800x3d rtx 5080httpspcpartpickercomlistxmdgzp
yeah thinking7900xtx get good price worst case go 7900xt hold put better amd gpu release later line regard nvidia fan tech dont care ray tracing personally ill save versus bandwagoning xx90 series 2k every year lol also old school maybe way id rather raw vram versus flashy ai stuff might embrace eventually ill keep trying resist
im pro amd generally seems 7900xtx aim ill compare note change thank much second opinion
mean people im pretty sure included 3080ti dont use rtx one buying new graphic card every year dont know stable 7900xt want would check video test game ran youtube
easy enough ive included sapphire nitro within budget rgb tax one best 7900xtx variant market cheaper option available well addition ive changed ram gskill variant used benchmarkers 9800x3d 7900xtxhttpspcpartpickercomlistgx8gzp
yeah idk exact apecs maybe video description 7900xt max setting run game 120 fps 1440p less demanding 4k like re4 remake coupled 9800x3d im praying bomb sale drop 7900xtx sale still valid stock plan purchasing everything approx 2 week
deleted
mean intels battlemage account excellent lowmid range set card ive seen expecting
impossible know pricing 9070 xt ready likely faster 7800xt access fsr4 big deal
old gone lot generation launch observation always dumbass leading launch explaining much gusto heshe waiting launch new generation buy old generation pricebreak logic look sound always look sound mean ebay right need understand really going card manufacturer making old gen last minute stopped making old gen higher edition card ago swapped new stuff playing game stock want stock depleted right launch idea walk bestbuy get discounted 4070 cause want deplete stock something nvidia amd actively trying avoid meanwhile trick think happening people replacing last year card year card selling discount never go way go ebay look price bit never completly understood truth undeniable discount want isnt really meanwhile store shelf scalper grabbing inventory quickly find advice gpu buying isnt really hard figure want look mfsrp use budget put money away dont touch ready pounce see patient might wait
7800xt must 500 euro 500 good price say bought one sapphire 470
probably 9070 look sweet pretty close release said im happy 7800xt itll last year
wait apu die
wanted wait pulled trigger 7800 xt couldnt wait anymore god know price amd gon na put 7800 xt best value gpu cant go wrong
go upgraded 7800xt sapphire pulse 1660s recently happy performance 1440p 9000 card release march run issue supply scaplers another half year becomes purchasable reasonable price
working computer would buy cpu use
7800xt good deal point view 500eur example im playing i7 9700k16gb ddr4radeon 6900xt im able play hogwarts legacy everything high without rt 4k60fps fsr quality running like charm visible framedrops hogsmeade like everyone im also playing last u everything high without rt without fsr 4k60fps frame gen rock solid 60fps smooth considering 7800xt giving performance 6900xt youll good year issue play high ultra tweak little bit fsr fg
bought 7800xt nitro 5 day ago im happy decision getting new gen msrp hard youll probably neeed wait month like im hyped 7800xt amazing card 1440p say go
buy used 3060 12gbs 150200 2070s
paid 500 7800 xt dont want risk losing scalper paying extra tariff im thrilled great card mean nice upgrade wife
7800xt amazing card
7800xt im happy get perfect 1440p amd zero driver issue unlike nvidia insert video linus giving middle finger however wait think next gen radeons seem like considerable enough jump
love 7800xt obviously meant high end ray tracing dont even turn rt time 1440p 120fps vast majority game doesnt even flinch price cant go wrong ever
get amazon get 30 day return like amd announces
put one gfs pc 1440p beast go
wouldnt get 7800xt one great card new gen amd significantly better worth waiting nvidia 5070ti also intriguing move towards ai could pay big time lame duck cant wait try nvidia geforce 2 month cost barely anything fun try choose new gen leisure comparison review without feeling pressure
used 6900xt less
got mine yesterday im sk happy think use case im gon na notice difference new 9070 series
still hope 9070xt good card bring balance graphic card market dont want wait case flop go 7800xt still great card
bad idea new gen amd gpus almost literally already term store stockpiled arent allowed buy yet release 5 week away every indication theyll lot performant current gen plus youll access fsr4 youve waited long whats another month bit wait
spending 500 card doesnt support ml based super resolution 2025 age well really wait 9070 cant afford upcoming 5070 ti
wait month bit
id get used 4070ti super new 5070 budget dlss4 way good amd struggling compete dlss 2
b580 one downside far know thats scalped hell find one 300 buck get enjoy
got 7900 xt first build great
thats good part whole thing good know beloved card thanks
im pretty happy somehow entire year since got could sworn 4 month price least waiting wouldnt helped
7900xtx
dont play well lowmid range cpu
thing may changed last heard significant overhead problem older low end cpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7g
need newgood cpu
holding since november however bought brother 6750xt almost 2 year ago price never gone go bit remains stable starting feel going 6 month without main pc end buying card could bought november exactly price
risky wait imo trump tariff pricing 9070 gon na inflated
thank much observation greatly appreciated
im primarily seeing lot 3xxx card sale seems like lot people replacing 5xxx card anticipating good deal ive seen couple 3070tis 325
least shipping portugal 500 best find saphire one find 600 actually place
565 amazon
say lol cheapest 7800xt country 500 go 590 500 good normal price actually checked price going 10 expensive since last week
problem saw thread everyone say coincidence booted ubuntu system get specific work done decided dist upgrade upgraded rebooted never came back life pc turn second show red light cpu turn try different apu bought 3200g second hand 30 euro testing boot ok
considering 5700x3d although already bit expensive first considered pulling trigger
portugal terrible second hand stuff everyone think something precious worth around 56 buying new even looking european ebay rarely see something 10 new worth hassle tbh
actually great idea
new gen amd significantly better worth waiting know without real benchmark price point
current price leak pretty bleak though there scalping dont think get hand 9070 5 week even willing throw 900 wanted
9070 supposed come 900 sure cut bit price doubt talking similar price range
sure theory even wait 3 year get whatever would get next month cheaper sarcastic exactly struggle constantly b een delaying decision cause always next gen next intel driver fix black friday wait gen
5070 650 euro saw second hand market pretty bad appreciate feedback though big wave pro7800xt first hour big wave people nice perspective
plus low performance lower end cpu
amd killed 6000 7000 series go
spend 500 friend recently got one 370
id say anything absolute best suffer somewhat
pretty sure gn dispelled myth
cpu
motherboard
sound like life portugal doesnt matter
500 fine price paid 560 mine back jan last year regret love little beast gpu run everything throw 1440p easily paired ryzen 7600 popular combination two pair perfectly
7000 card getting stock amd push sale new card hard see card available spain every card expensive past black friday sadly
bleh
presume reset bios know pain retest unlikely cpu would fry software
upgraded exact combo couple month back work amazing 1440p go worry upgrading couple year
would good combo gaming 5600x would okay thats afford assume am4 motherboard already
really unfortunate honestly sorry hear eastern europe people selling 900 series gtx card 250 u equivalent possible card shipped purchased u seller break importation law
pricing leak leak especially ignored theyre likely wrong often part bc changed last minute official release past say 900 maybe itll likely itll way cheaper well wait week see scalping open q much seems like scalper focus limited supply nvidia card well see
doesnt really matter anymore nvidia priced 5070 ti 750 amd price 9070 xt 700 mean 9070 would 600
difference 6 week 6 month though
come fps visual quality dlss4 give 2540 higher fps visual quality equivalent native even better sometimes amd cant compete theyre far behind 910 gamers choose nvidia
httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophp12gbgigabytegeforcertx4070windforceocaktivpcie40x16retail1489368html 550 4070 5070 similarly priced
well probably dont want use low end cpu 1440p card anyway
know cheapest seen 489 past month looking
yeah insane seeing b580 lose performance 5700x3d despite cpu holding back much powerful 4080 super
steve clear result invalidate people conclusion showed effect disappears high resolution crank every setting max hardware unboxed ran test configuration much closer someone tight budget would actually play game
gn admission tested fairly limited suite compared hardware unboxed
yap puzzled review seeing driver overhead post expected worst normal seems like damage battlemages reputation done matter misguided reviewer intentional foul play
b580 b570 lose performance paired low endmid cpu defeat whole point entry level gpu httpsyoutubebujsnbvyxvasic9qioxn4ef4hcq3 httpsyoutubecyojr3masi0ylke7xcatndmonh
apu died buying new cpu
b450 tomhawk max
fine bought mine 2023 release day
would prevent boot regardless cpu cause boot 3200g 5700g checked firmware version case ubuntu done something crazy version greatly appreciate feedback btw thanks lot
yeah trying maximize am4 board 32gb ram already decent ssd plus since 3200g side testing problem like future could always move gpu new build newer chipset leave current build 3200g kid utility build kind thing
youd usually pay tax top 23 total cost including shipping 225 thats 63 extra top
pretty much every cpu am4 motherboard run b580 issue almost guaranteed performance issue tp upgrade am5 looking much higher end gpu
facebook marketplace edit people downvoting think used gpus bad lmao
also interesting 5700x3d faster 7600x gaming overall 7600x experienced significantly less intel driver overhead necessarily surprising still noteworthy
pure cope vendetta hardware unboxed loved card initially vram price performance came gn also said result got dont invalidate reviewer point issue bad higher resolution setting youre realistically gon na entry level graphic card
youre spending 500 gpu ill guess youll get decent cpu wouldnt worry cpu issue still exist
httpsibbcos73mn7mh
hard say thing bit mysterious without knowing exactly go people possible know there new cpu reset parameter mystery really cpu shouldnt usually able fry like software o shouldnt changing anything bios usually
yeah make sense
could find 2070s better around price point someone u able willing ship could good deal youve got money buy new imo id get 7800xt wait another couple month amd drop 9000 series along hopefully new cuda frame work best luck man
oh really thats kinda sad am4 still life left guess intel work best intel afterall
saying got 370 without saying got second hand dishonest
guess youre getting downvoted fb marketplace reliable source everyone cant guarantee want especially youre major metropolitan area possible scammer deal unsure condition card probably warranty also stating friend got one 370 without also stating got used bit apple orange
probably extra memory bandwith ddr5
said issue really issue low gpu load midrange card youre probably dealing often anyways also probably something going issue folk play light title framerate capped 60fps card hit 100fps yes folk dont im advocating buying intel card everyone working accurate information
isnt basically everything am4 affected though op would buy motherboard ram
look like marketplace real store unopened unpacked guaranteeoriginal safe purchase every product idk seems dodgy hell post real site ya screenshot
definitely give shot report back work find way remotely buy beer everyone saying coincidence maybe dist upgrade pushed dying cpu edge 3yo 1 week cpu never pushed hard though find odd yes thats 1 week warranty expired talk coincidence thank
op replied info
logic others saying 500 without saying new also dishonest lol
dont think apple orange comparison used pc part absolutely fine one thread said wanted new one youre budget id always try get hand used part except psu storage even big box store like best buy microcenter recommended lot available everywhere
exactly
im stupid give extra commission shop seller country order stuff directly eu place price best httpswwwkupujemprodajemcomkompjuteridesktopgrafickekarticepretragakeywords780020xtcategoryid10groupid102pricefrom460currencyeurorderprice
ive never cpu burn except exceptional circumstance dont think happens unless there kind bug design
defacto assumption new ur one suggesting used u make clear
nothing wrong used one want thats stretch bud logic work aint mad misleading
brother listed second hand unopened product cheap return policy shop warranty per warning case mistake misunderstanding purchase returning unpacked product question case defective product arriving automatically receive replacement sent warranty warranty take 2 month take live serbia part eu law place forbid kind policy practice im sure even buy site live eu probably sell cheap serbia wont deliver service inside eu might interesting deal live serbia say 7800xt must 500 really correct experience inside eu like said price actually rising little right
teach live new gpus warranty bought one listed way order advertise new open business seller profit tax return well developed scheme havent heard anyone problem warranty problem
like said might good deal live serbia dont live idea gpu market law around otherwise thanks posting link interesting price really good seem take care long eu factory warranty guess send back inside eu take care send back figured site amount listing must workaround somehow exactly sure
yes send back need use warranty package arrive depart twice week way saved 150 euro gpu alone need part come value almost brand new pc thats astronomical price difference ask havent bought electronic component home country year buy thing aliexpress temu
buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead amd cpu dont work well faster ram
get ram speed 6000 good
also check ca latency make sure 30 good build youre wasting money think know already
alright yep know expensive build dont need much power lol wanted check good build thank reply appreciate
amd motherboard totally fine dont like
need higher end motherboard cpu pull alot power amd cpu efficient enough run even 9700x 9800x3s motherboard
would either spend something like 7700x 7600x3d bundle go 12700k bundle upgrade am6 7600x bundle isnt great

card includes adapter box
750w depends cpu enough run 360w rtx 5080 5080 likely come adapter included need get new psu unless really want
adapter work like specific plug psu meant existing one 3080 using perhaps gon na cause issue pulling power plug supposed never designed
multiple 8 pin pcie power connector one end 12vhpwr connector
1 nothing worry really gpu arrive included 12vhpwr cable adapter either 3 4 pcie 8 port 12vhpwr plug plug adapter gpu thats nothing overthink psu weak shut designed way harm psu 4 pci 62 8 thats
strange okay got seeing modern psus dedicated hvpwr plug meant made think using plug isnt meant work even work see adapter lot negative word mouth seems kinda sus make sense anyway
1 something nowadays included dont use adapter 2 adapter thing get criticized 12vhpwr plug thing rated 600w exactly 600w normal pci 8pin cable rated 150w cable overspeced real wattage cable safely deliver around 215260w depends quality 4 cable deliver 860w1040w safely thats one really understood new plug worse old method especially consider heat cant distributed well accumulates one plug instead 4 even 3 would better 1 12vhpwr plug
building new am4 box going upgradable
might get httpscapcpartpickercomlistbryf4p little gpuheavy rx 7700 xt worth opinion wont need upgrade soon game run much better am5 platform course 5700 youd picked actually slower 5600 game got ta careful misleading cpu name anyway problem ryzen 5 7600 use stock cpu cooler change later loud planned monitor keyboard mouse speaker etc wired internet need wifi
httpscapcpartpickercomlistdvb974 newer am5 platform better ssd case included fan 50 buck cheaper dont get b580 older platform perform better faster cpu
id probably go am5 ryzen 5 7600
never worry much psu telling tomfuckery coming pike require 200 watt upgrade
instead cooler master cpu cooler maybe go thermalright phantom spirit peerless asssassin great budget cooler
im idiot didnt realize hit end development life
everyone else telling use am5 board ill make sure switch monitor im still searching mouse keyboard im using trash setup connect laptop likely gon na need wifi

120mm 140mm fan provide cooling difference speed 140mm fan provide cooling lower speed also mean lower noise asking almost negligible difference concerned noise 140mm may better case support
depends case mount 140mm fan without extra obstruction however lot case rail fan mounting block 2030 airflow add turbulence 120mm actually perform better hopefully obvious running 6 fan purely cosmetic wouldnt recommend dropping 100 fan unless every component top line

every game engine different care ram speed others much going 3200 3600 maybe 1 difference cpu cpu run ram 3600
worth
r7 5700g probably much general curious learn information performance increase simulation game like city skyline 2 particular run unity
even went higher speed ddr5 ram mean something else isnt worth
replacing 5700g better cpu dedicated gpu lot better upgrading ram
ddr5 youd also upgrade cpu motherboard
dedicated gpu 7800xt cpu gift slight upgrade last thats im using cpu recommendation cpu heavy game
ye heard
5700x3d
definitely change cpu 5700x3d thinking ram much faster gaming 5700g
5700x3d pick one aliexpress stock dry look like starting used 5800x3d option
1000w recommended 5090 ok amount 80
bare minimum 650 watt according calculator used recommended card 850 watt 1000w plenty
seems like good plan
spec released 5090s honestly im following news cant imagine computer ever needing entire kilowatt power run thats crazy talk
would least go 850 watt calculator never account spike decide hook controller charger hub usb use rgb controller controller number minute detail add 50 75 watt quickly

ill using 850w 5080 9800x3d build im planning
dont rule corsair see 5080 cpu wont pull 550w add 100w part youre still comfortably within range im working number 360w 5080 162w 9800x3d happy corrected theyre wrong
nvidia recommending 850w using 9950x cpu stock take 7080w stock 9800x3d likelihood 750w fine setup review guess 1000w side overkill
im planing use corsair rmx 750 5080 7800x3d
psu calc say 750 fine nvidia recommends 850 9950x3d 170w
get atx30 31 compliant one old one trigger overcurrent voltage protection shut randomly happens seasonic 850w 1000w psus iirc tester tested 5090 5080 would draw like 900w peak power consumption definitely get one newer standard
1000w plenty shouldnt need 1200w
gpu alone us 575w
thank definitely go 1000w think like future proofing really want atx 31 pci 50 ready
im running triple fan aio 9 fan im loading havn case
thank input old psu however really old corsair cx750m 80 bronze semimodular ive read 9800x3d also utilize cpu pin slot order operate full speedcapacity old psu one 4 pin definitely upgrade
850w probably thats needed
nope solid 1000 watt unit plenty
deleted
quiet light speed 120mm pwm high speed fan apparently draw 54w 12 would draw max 65w youre going need fan real issue generally people dont run fan 100 speed rule thumb generally would say 100w youll draw noncpu gpu component hard find actual amount part youve got lot id mindful around running many fan one header thatd easiest one overload 12 system fan
yeah worth upgrade based info actual wattage
well sold ps5 ive never built pc clue wattage psu everything
ok thank
water cooling first build
deleted
im sure bought lian li aio 360mm im lian li fan 9800x3d 5080 im tryna build something good dont upgrade year want nice
well thats many bought
aio watercooling like splurge fan thats okay bit surprised first build everyones budget different
deleted
build watch use aio triple fan setup cooling gpu figured norm way im early 30 probably different budget build teenager younger adult
big psu get still havent answered question lol im serious im first time pc builder dont want get something thats gon na mess
31 also kid budget tighter early 20

oh yea feel actually saving awhile felt like time treat
thanks

upgraded 3700x ftom 1700x year ago amd big jump get 5700x3d price hopefully come bit gaming 5700x3d productivity 59005950x either way huge upgrade
using computer
go cpu upgrade save alot money bang buck choice
really wantneed core save am5 mostly use pc gaming get 5700x3d
using system cache important core gaming gaming get 5700x3d
reminder 5900xt also 16core part 12core like 5900x 5950 nonx part difference 1ghz clock speed decrease
asks component advice without even saying pc doesnt elaborate leaf
ask need 16 core single program use use 2 even futureproofing never need 8 nearly everything 5800x3d chip want
firstkudo saying uefi upgrade bios upgrade core looking dont want complete machine overhaul 5950x brainer id say get aliexpress 5700x3d youre happy vega 64 doesnt bring much table 8 yearsyour motherboard psu probably used might 2 year left tank
gaming 5700x3d5800x3d beat 5950x
gaming used 5800x3d new 5700x3d productivity 5950x go 5 7600x blow mind decent b650 motherboard 9800x3d cpu x870 motherboard decent specked nvme drive gpu think powerful pc ever
7 1700 til am6
yeah 5900x5950x also great chip gaming 5700x3d tinylittlebit smoother faster
half gaming half work often time like multitasking recently streaming factorio handbrake queue plod along enjoy coding thing work thread
like thing many responces leaning toward am5 rebuild hope murphy doesnt come along kill taichi right commit
added mix productivity another vote am4 might even skip am5 hold 6 go well enough
yeah really confusing naming choice theyd increasing max core count newer gen shifting number around x900 mean 16 core x950 mean 24 something would made sense 9900 9950 still 12 16 core respectively odd make 5950 suffix letter
thats news thanks didnt know xt cpu store near 5900xt 560 v 5950x 650 feel likea nobrainer 100mhz
yeah added usecase detail im used amd 10 responces week 17 day rbuildapc comendably dedicated
asked said yes lie caught oogling truck marketplace new lego program use every thread available fun get multiprocessingthreading working cache core ratio x3d surprising 8 core 16 nut vote sticking am4
dont get aliexpress 5700x3d right check reliable seller 1000 sold unit stock listing saturated newer seller recent review show 5700x non 3d used caution shopping
got ta acurate least ofthe time admitedly still say bios typing teaching form nicer word id trust fb marketplace cpu aliexpress cpu though cache size x3d nut never would guessed even 5600x3d 50 l3 5950x though peak am4 hadnt though untill psu turning 11 june shes living brand truely cougar oft list replacement grows
lol tightarse part would idea am6 get gamng squad stick older game smaller build pottering around valheim server castle 20fps getting bit annoying
would bother buying new mobo ram 5700x3d 5800x3d am5 cpu gaming productivity slightly weaker 8 core 16 thread processor enough justify extra cost imo
actually telling get one make sense video card
scope creep
am6 around time next gen console right looking like late 2027 ideal time upgrade got 2nd hand 7800xt 7 1700 500w build im energy efficient talk tight im getting 100fps 1440p 7 1700 16mb l3 cache 8 core 16 thread pair nice gpu see performs
found read gamers nexus 9950x review yeah indeed amusingly f1 2024 5800x3d beating 9950x thought would generational improvement also forgot even 1000 skipped there 6000 8000 gen guess 5700x3d 400 5900xt 560 5950x 650 aud life getting expensive downunder something 5900xt 100 less yet spec show 100mhz reduction
data recovery firm might able get data back cost thousand dollar much worth

depends much prepared spend

ive read theyre good cad work
dont know wont actual benchmark come
5070 4070 super
wait benchmark
5070 annihilates 3070 beat 4070 cheaper along new technology look extremely good far
gave bought 4070super
70 series releasing
comment rught gold
5070 expensive 4070 itll priced similar 4070 super
4070 didnt beat 3070 term efficiency mean
didnt wan na wait long tbh
honestly assumed wouldve already posted
meant msrp price honestly pretty cheap msrp
youre worried efficiency upgrade psu
nvidia slowrolling review process rtx 5090 5080 release january 30th rtx 5090 review embargo january 24th 1 week release rtx 5080 review embargo last heard january 30th day release thats good sign rtx 5070 5070 ti rumored released february 20th dont believe anyone know review embargo set expire yet
well yeah true although ground reality different country itll cost 2030 actual pricing due scalper n stuff
gpu miner thats im concerned
yea still think people find 5070s cheaper 4070s even scalper 50 decreased msrp know 5070 wont expensive 4070s maybe first day scarcity definitely worth price 4070 better tech less money
youll fine careful plugging thing back motherboard
doesnt really matter much grand scheme thing go without
ok leave
brand new nothing worth buying price range used market get used gtx 1070 1070 ti

well dollar 100 would 125 still budget low gpu lol
shop used part search result chinese website box
sell 3 1080ti 100usd week ago also price everyone else wanted get rid lol
usually buy ebay make sure pay credit card film unpacking almost guaranteed protection scammer
dont buy hyper 212 cooler look thermalright phantom spirit 120 instead
brand new 4060 horrible deal try find used 3060 ti faster much cheaper

doesnt matter either order
doesnt really matter would update bios first already installation usb set dont another one install window first bios update
updating bios always good idea run newest bios system moment
updating bios first save time sometimes window recognizes mobo new hardware bios update make wait
triple check know install new bios feel uncomfortable installing new bios without window window first
fine download bios update usb window installation
ask ai
apparently amd gpu doesnt good support ai program take account

5700x3d
r5 3600 already 4 cpu
think worth upgrade get x3d either 5700x3d 5800x3d
definitely would worth time put 5800xt coming 5700x unless youre expecting minimal difference would save little throw 5700x3d solid upgrade thats worth time wife enjoy 5700x solid cpu well sure 5800xt good option would
price 5700x3d high am5 cpu performs well am5 cpu 5800xt 5800x think boost clock 100mhz higher thats worth hassle would grab 5700x3d remember x3d cache doesnt apply every game game improve drastically game wont
seems like thats best chip am4 5900x need extra performance productivity theyre price range right
yeah seems like difference would less ten percent bump performance adding heat
yeah thats noticed im guessing would gain probably less 10 performance adding extra heat deal could find better price 5700x3d would absolutely jump right one ive seen used one going least 250 buck thanks info
basically ya crazy much hotter 5800x 5800xt run used 5800x 5800x3d run cooler brother 5700x run cool ya price 5800xt great cpu would send extra 5700x3d youll notice big difference game large cache either way youll happy think going 5700x3d smarter move
difference 5800x 5800xt 1 look 5800x 5700x comparison enable pbo set limit 5800x 200mhz curve optimizer one try something 10 25 work
thanks advice look like ill waiting better deal x3d cant find one soon ill wait save am5 platform better longevity
oh wow sound like there much point think got unlucky silicon mine though cant get reach 46 boost without running issue boost 45 still run well hot considering upgrading wife 5600 5700x since theyre also sale 140 buck saw 5800xt sparked curiosity try upgrade pc even marginal difference long price good
np good choice youll happy forsure patience virtue enjoy pull trigger
well ill damned happened another quick search google 5700x3d see came across deal might missed sudden stumbled across combo deal cpu 280mm ekwb elite drgb aio 240 free shipping good deal
ended going kept looking online store cpu cheaper could find brand new one 350 used one 250 im even thinking selling aio come getting beefy air cooler instead since im sure thermalright assassin king 5 heat pipe enough cool anyways thanks input helping decide
sound like good deal
go different gpu used 3080 3070 better need cuda dont
ryzen 5800x hella cheap rn 4060 turd
really dedicated gpu significantly better igpu
setup solid entrylevel midrange gaming youre looking play demanding game want better setting think adding dedicated gpu like rx 6750 xt rtx 3060 line itll really boost gaming experience
seems like solid pick likely want maybe youd better trying 2nd hand gpu thsts bit better though
try looking 7500f aliexpress maybe spend much mobo butnit doesnt really matter
im clued amd system understand am5 give room growth future still supported right build eye seems logical dont think youve overdone one area come cost make sure gpu isnt massive balancing thing maybe someone give variety card look alternative long doesnt blow budget additional fan good idea air flow always nice
focusing cpu ram motherboard right upgrading gpu later good plan rx 6600 run modded fallout nv skyrim fine might hard time newer game like rdr2 cyberpunk high setting youre ready upgrading better gpu like rx 6700 xt rtx 3060 really boost performance tougher game overall plan look great build solid base upgrade gpu later keep system date next year
buy lianli lancool 207 6 forget extra fan big upgrade nothing id buy biggest silicon power teamgroup nvme 3040 drive could afford ill leave gpu expert
nah 900 6600 build
motherboard recommend dont really understand make one better another picked one review
yeah thats idea debated pretty heavily am4 5 generally am4 part cheaper figured since longer supported id eventually switch am5 might well start am5 whenever want upgrade ill slap new gpu race
awesome fallout skyrim really im looking play right hear theyre cpu intensive anything throwing underpowered gpu system shouldnt hinder current goal allow save something like 4090 future thank feedback
right notice case intake fan seems odd wouldnt want fan back top pull hot air please forgive silly question im quite new learning curve proving pretty steep
judt cheapest one feature need heatsinks vrm
problem
front fan suck cool air cpu cooler bottom fan suck cool air blow straight gpu psu mounted front doesnt interfere intake see online review case check excellent thermal could mount exchaust fan back behind cpu cooler needed temp perfect running silent mode
7500f great suggestion saving 6080 negligible impact performance exactly kind advice hoping thank
cpu choice would helpful starter

best period would probably one msi meg godlike asus maximus extreme im partial msi though tend better customer support less qc issue recently gaming midrange x870 fine ive eyeing msis x870 carbon though little bit higher end
whats best motherboard currently msi meg series currently cant find good motherboard definition good trying find motherboard support gen 45 stuff performs fast would help knew cpu mind looking crazy expensive overly cheap one idea without knowing exact cpu best advise meet fairly easy meet parameter msi mag series asrock riptide series asus tuf series fairly balanced feature set solid power delivery

oh really guess ill go 40
oh interesting ill check
like performance wise unless dont still sorta new
amd intel make big difference amd beat intel gaming however
mean youre spending 2k gpu alone might well
basically need decide want mobos dont affect performance unless extreme overclocking get reliable board manufacturer like msi gigabyte asrock asus fine pick based look look back panel make sure usb connector want support cpu get
amd
im going recommend one doesnt need backplate ive great luck asrock motherboards also make sure motherboard fit case
yes clone old drive new one work
buy sata ssd
ive done going 500gb drive 1tb used clonezilla clone smaller drive content onto bigger one worked fine ran issue partition size structure cloned well meaning bigger drive ended limited 500gb usable space fix boot window boot drive btw extend volume manually dont remember used might third party app window disk management

id recommend dedicated cloning tool httpswwwredditcomrcomputerscomments186uicowhatarethebestoptionsforfreediskcloning

kind money buy 5090
nah worthwhile
4k barely difference techpowerup show 1 difference relative performance 4k
might gain faulty chip anything close worth
far ive issue 13700k could lucky 4k 5090 fine 13700k
worth risk intel asked 13700k 9800x3d would respond hell yeah
first fine gambling instability issue answer maybe 4k game largely gpu bound although cpu faster might translate real world fps gain
dont risk 13900ks 14700k faulty also tom hardware review 13700k5090 1080p equivalent 9800x3d4080s 9800x3d 4k able observe nvidia claimed 30 improvement 4090 u want 5090 4k fps 4090 better upgrade 9800x3d
budget issue get 9800x3d
get 9800x3d
make think wont
wont able buy 5090 whole new build aswel wonder difference would 13700k 9800x3d 4k
5090 upgrade maybe ram currently 32gb 6000
wont upgrading whole pc 5090 thats much
gpu
meant cpu recently went 13700k 9800x3d high difference performance 1440p even 4k see difference 1 low aff ct smoothness game
32gb ram plenty unless playing specific game use m flight sim
dude gpu part whole pc asking cpu upgrade 9800x3d cpu yes need new mobo worth
5090
suppose could use current ram 32gb 6000mhz
yes
4070 already gigantic upgrade 3060 5070 incrementally better 10900x weak link paired modern 70class better gpu unless youre playing competitive setting id bump gpu first
5070 huge jump especially 1080p youre looking double fps 3060 upgrade cpu well
contact seller request refund dont help get ebay involved protect
amd wont give damn secondhand cpu purchase photograph try straighten pin contact seller cant get work
supposed new used either way id return bother
state bent pin description buyer lose case

ssd samsung 990 pro forgot put let update link embarrassing also ive heard x3d model game well worse anything else true dont want sacrifice video editing much pretty shit baseline maybe anything would upgrade
wonderful thanks much ill save post use bios instruction im pretty sure cooler master fit ill get apevia mind big 500w enough would prefer 750 futureand may even need motherboard im remembering part come everything fucked
cpu upgrading 5700x3d worse nonx3d 8core ryzen 5000 cpu stuff like video rendering faster 5600
dont want last thing happen best luck
ryzen 5 2600 almost 6 year old upgrade good upgrade ill definitely look 5700x3d
yeah 5700x3d dominate 2600 load 2700x 5800x3d upgrade upgrade would maybe even little dramatic
would say need cooler recommendation look like price generally going drive hour get 220 may move
eesh 220 148 aliexpress week ago even theyre 200 might recommend grabbing 5600x 80 still like 70 faster 2600 riding bit get latemodel am5 even am6 stuff
gotten everything little bit earlier well 5600x 115 5700x 140 5800x 170 dont think 3d one coming back anything reasonable might 5700x 5800x skip am6 come need next upgrade need part year hopefully degree better job time need better stuff maybe ill find lot money ground year two
come soon want dive gaming new setup hold little longer might snag better deal something futureproof youre itching get back gaming 7900xt still solid pick
stock nvidia 5000 going sell know availability pricing look like believe tarrifs go effect feb 1 likely impact thing fast enough could probably get radeon 9070 probably sell fast shoe id keep 7900 xt good gpu last play today unless youre worried price youre either willing wait play stock tracking game case shoot star
good

750 ti along 16gb ram i7 would work even 180w power supply would definitely melt explode realistically power running tf2 admirably even 4gb ram found exciting tf2 benchmark since 13 havent played anything power consuming wow classic fallout 2 decade standard high thank friend couldnt possibly away northern california deep within wood appreciate offer immensely though

around mid2000s dell day actually rewire standard atx connector one person came shop blown motherboard therefore trust without proof anymore always carry multimeter toolbox

thank thank gpu recommendation cheaper better originally ordered maybe maybe play civ 6 near future
lga 1700 compatible
yes would vrms work normally
need compatible
id personally vote either 265k 12700k something like willing take risk 13th 14th gen
much love 5950x 265k upgrade path probably going faster am4 dead cpu socket am5 stuff r9 9900x almost price 265k seller upgrade path feel better option option lower power consumption mean run cooler 7900x also little cheaper problem read people issue intel ultra stuff wouldnt say defective certainly less case 14th gen stuff atm dont think could go wrong 265k got experience music production take grain salt read intel suppose better ryzen dont know thats still case
dont know total budget im sure 7700x 7900x would challenge purchased 278 378 respectively
also want add better cpu 400 please let know
deleted
ryzen 9 7900x
total cost core ultra 265k generally lower amd equivalent particularly motherboard feature taken account always buy combo find unstable unusable use case return think lot early introduction kink worked though im sure multicore optimization window microcenter nearby 265k 300 get 70 z890 board ultimate difference platform cost likely going boil motherboard feature wantneed need tb4 intels going cheaper like 265k productivity ryzen 7 productivity benchmark tend favor always check review whatever software need run whether p e core get 20 core 265k
yeah degradation stuff scared 14700k intel say fixed idk trust
thanks reply ive read high core important music production efficiency core thing confusing ive read 265k essentially 14 core cpu cause efficiency core like 12 idk thank u clearing issue 265k though worried
9900x currently sale 400 think buy really quickly afford
say intel chip generation motherboard last time intel one generation motherboard fyi intels 12 13 14 gen cpu socketmotherboard 10 11 socket 6 7 8 9 socket
problem afaik music production really lvoes core amd lackluster department new core ultra series reportedly also issue think wan na safe 265k truly want norisk experience amd best choice pointed expensive compared intel
yeah mean 9900x 30 7900x decent deal clue long deal last want take advantage youd probably go ahead pull trigger though miss deal either 7000 series suggestion fine music production imo
yeah sure theyd think core ultra 2 series would chip made lga 1851 though fair run 2 generation socket awhile 6 7 interchangeable 8 9 although four generation technically lga 1151 6th 7th gen worked revision 1 8th 9th gen worked revision 2 effectively still 2 generation per socket
httpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentscpusintelshipsnovalakecpustopartnersfortestingsamplesintendedforvalidationandresearch nova lake expected require new socket unless intel port panther lake desktop lga 1851 could one shortestlived platform intels history next gen intel ddr6 chip lga 1851 285k refresh based silicon get
yeah confusing part whole efficiency core thing intel going dont even know well work daw
yeah checked benchmark stuff seems like 7900x 9900x lot similar thought ill probably wait day hopefully sale still around lol thanks insight though appreciate
thats fair would expect socket stay cpu come usb5 pcie6 ddr6 add pcie lane none seem imminent besides intel much bigger thing fix topend gaming nothing thing lead changing socket plus think heat intel feeling amd would lead changing socket less often sell 265k285k buyer 385k motherboard make good upsell performance user much likely buy intel round amd game amd playing long word intel longer bully force user buy new motherboards often used
article nova lake coming awhile would assume intel something end 2025 perhaps panther lake thats improves upon 200 desktop series
use reset cmos jumper key set default boot try
maybe wait 9950x3d releasing fairly soon
latest else doesnt declared site version must udated correct direction rare case think crash doesnt related bios version worked well driver issue
ok httpswwwasrockcommbamdx57020taichiindexaspbioshttpswwwasrockcommbamdx57020taichiindexaspbios look site im looking latest would mean recent thats marked beta also never updated bios need usb aware good resource watching done prior
httpswwwasrockcomsupportbiosigaspcatbios10httpswwwasrockcomsupportbiosigaspcatbios10 563 beta ok reflash 560 unstable read hdd format usb fat32 put unzipped file
well wasnt hard lol thanks help instantly noticed difference computer u back starting faster open boot menu hoping transfer performance increase gaming

sell upgrade gpu
oh wow thanks video give new outlook
even selling gpu wouldnt enough upgrade 3060ti gpu price currently spiking also love 3060ti would rather overclock slight bump upgrade year
youre stuck performance youre already getting plus 6 way get significant performance increase selling 3060 ti upgrading say gpu price currently spiking doesnt mean 3060 ti spike well
necessarily much incentive increase higher 30 series card would better upgrade 40 series card 40 series shortage new used market 40 series going higher demand 30 series card meaning 3060ti still worth around 220 used even used 40 series card upwards 300 easily said post dont fund upgrade besides original question overclocking cpu worth graphic card
overclocking anything nothing special 3060 ti worth 275 300 play card right
cooler using understand wanting run cooler youre danger zone
nope 5800x3d arent really available get 5700x3d even starting get bit scarce get another year least
first rule pc building dont upgrade anything start new build scratch futureproof intention upgrading come time upgrade one start new build scratch rinse repeat
totally agreed especially leveraging pcie lane resizable bar ever id say go full new build team red since tom hardware showed 5090 intel platform performs par 9800x3d4080s
desktop gpus similarhttpstechnicalcityenvideoradeonrx7700xtvsgeforcertx4070mobile laptop gpu always limited cooling power
8700g suck 9600x good choice right price 7500f76007600x usually quite bit cheaper little slower 9600x theyre worth looking
thanks lot

dont buy intel cpu gaming 4090 massively overpriced due shortage
isnt 50 series yet
recommend
cpu either 7800x3d 9800x3d gpu bit harder 5090 come friday likely impossible find month maybe 5080
ryzen 7 9 also cant find 50 series 4080 super seems similar performance 4090 half price

cant recommend hard disk drive 2025
thank
buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead
small form factor increase heat noise getting 7600x thing want pretty hard fo small form factor especially first pc build cool quite pc need air flow like said challenging small form factor 4070ti also put good amount heat especially low air flow situation quiet mean low fan rpm probably wont happen need higher fan rpm pump enough air cool system atx mid tower really big imo would make exponentially easier accomplish want also want cl30 ram instead cl36
ok til cl terminology ram whats difference cl30 guess cl36 build
small form factor part cant budge unfortunately limited space know small form factor prone higher temp ideally im trying get thing relatively quiet choosing part dont require much power easy cool im trying render big project anything game browse internet part
cl30 faster
want less heat first part grade gpu pretty hot card 285w tdp 4070 would close half 160w 7600 40w less tdp 7600x would rather x also ram listed wont even work either cpu max speed cpu 5200mts small form factor must compromise noise heat wont thermal throttle certainly heat room definitely silent
7600x non x support 5200 mt
gotcha lower faster ill change ram
ah good call ram didnt consider max speed cpu power draw 4070 ti super concern seemed like pretty big jump wanted little future proof game line maybe 4070 super may better option
officially yes basically 7000 series cpu allow overclock ram 6000 mt amd even testing official benchmark data speed
4070 temp future proof opposite side spectrum 4070 solid mid range card yes 4070ti better
