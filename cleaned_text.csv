used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly
aib model 5090s avoid whatever reason pay asus tax
got sparkle intel arc a310 eco tforce vulcan 25 inch ssd know powerful stuff play league legend pc want 144fps stuff get know pci 4 slot card resizable bar needed
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax v2 decent enough motherboard ryzen 5 7600x 64gb ram
im thinking getting new pc upgrading current one something ive never done spec need find current pc share see would better video card one know sure need radeon rx 580
want bench test cpu motherboard ram make sure component work wait gpu without installing cpu cooler im going sff cooler block ram would repaste cpu replace ram end issue ram
hey live israel gpu market kinda expensive rtx 4070 ti super go like 1165 store sapphire rx 7600 xt 16gb go 455 asrock amd radeon rx 6700 xt challenger pro 12gb oc much would guy pay gpu second hand get around 200250 good deal considering price listed
5080 review start coming
thing dustproof build build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible
game dev would recommend going amd card higher vram nvidia card lower vram nvidia card really expensive tough choice
hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup
embargo lifted launch day thursday
thing dustproof build make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan
window right click task bar open task manager click detail button open info go performance tab able get info
dust filter going completely prevent dust getting caking fan airflow would terrible
name emphasis custom p spend shitton money contract someone help thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan fan access air thats push airflow eventually get dust finer dust filter less dust fan worse airflow coarser dust filter dust fan better airflow lian li new case lancool somethingorother cant remember numerical designation came last year button jiggle front fan quickly try dislodge dust honestly practical solution pick case like mentioned filter easy removeclean fan nice accessible
ok thank seems like easy way deal dust

whats point 5080 included thread wait launch day benchmark need new megathread
5080 benchmark coming launch day sketchy hell think going suck sidegrade 4080s 5070ti intriguing bet
thought 5090 could revealed today 5080 wait launch

review go pcie 4 v pcie 5 comparison wasnt impression would really matter curious confirmed anyone get board 40
buying 4090 month launch msrp perhaps greatest purchasing decision ive ever made

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna
review vr performance seems good bump 4090 general
lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user
would liked seen review 5080 im sure hell paying 5090 5080 would consider
anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality
optimistic 5070ti card going look like without 4x fake frame cheesing
5080 benchmark yet
im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause
theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090
paying 25 27 performance improvement doesnt feel like generational advancement quite disappointing
also enjoy optimumshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5yjnfreqhiw review like point typically make really good explaining thing generally make review interesting watch
3080 12gb currently vram boost 5080 impressive streamer im wondering whether mfg gon na help leaving headroom encoders thing whilst gaming big question 5080 gon na outperform 4090 spec wise dont think im gon na leaning raw performance seriously hooked marvel rival 240hz oled 4090 drop enough value make price performance appealing 5080hmmm decision
suck buy new psu 750 cant use even wanted
amd need come 9070 asap

waiting 5070 5080 review decide upgrade 3080 get ps5
game 2k upgraded processor 9800x3d 3080 ti thinking grabbing 5080 reasonable upgrade wait see 5080 ti come
review went live today im confused sale 30th right
5090 actually good 5080 uhhhh 16gb still

hope somone compare 5080 fe idle power general use case efficiency 4080 fe since 256bit 16gb
5080 review
sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying
running 5090 pcie3x16 pcie4x16 would add video review list hardware canuck rtx 5090 cpu bottleneck pcie scaling benchmark morehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5tjkp2a0iw specifically test running card pcie3x16 pcie4x16 stated reason people using riser cable case installation limited speed pcie4x16 test great interest people current system gpu slot pcie4x16 wont attempt summarize tested lot different combination varying result conclusion feasible run pcie4x16 without losing much im also interested happens run pcie5x8 using pcie5 lane m2 card content creation wasnt tested im fully aware pcie5x8 overall bandwidth pcie4x16 5x8 fine bandwidth point view since pcie5 reduced latency pcie4 would think 5x8 might better certainly worse 4x16 wont know sure unanticipated effect going 5x8 someone test
im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation
removed
input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090
want put 2070 pasture badly 5080 5090 look like nvidia funneling 5080 supertibothwhatever

cost rest system coolinghttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
performance nvidia boasting still ai upscaling
extra 100w power draw time performance giving intel vibe pump wattage chip point theyll step back focus efficiency unless also want u market install 240v line pc
good cooling system probably need wit scaling watt usage match
noiiice
nvidia successfully got consumer stating 2k founder edition flagship card rip
cooling might impressive context insane amount heat able deal end day solve problem card caused temp still higher noise higher remarkable good still worse cooling dealing almost 600watts mention heating getting dumpe case heat component room cooling thing isnt selling point
5090 lot faster potential 4090 ti
almost like pure rasterization power plateauing way keep pumping performance pump power consumption price
post rnvidia youll get well ackshually even though spirit correct modest jump huge jump price power consumption exactly youd expect 4090ti redesigned core feature arent important performance power consumption make seem like mid gen refresh

5090 isnt gaming card ai tinkering card
could actually get rrp would totally get 5090 ill try disgusting resellers making actual price card go insane level make nope fuck
miss day flagship 300400 yeah inflation even adjusted inflationhttpsiimgurcomligvzphpng still absolutely jumped shark also acknowledge development process expensive labor gone 45x increase way decent paying full time job low cost living area supportive spouse even barely make argument midrange card point new am5 build 1600 13rd cost 7800xt
tell think ive got
yes first row misaligned
httpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentsgpusnvidiageforcertx4080superreview make slashing base msrp 1199 rtx 4080 999 4080 super msrp manufacturer suggested retail pricing made number nvidia
seems pretty much inline difference core count two card
dude 4k good test card even best cpu difference increase 8k
came someone watching closely title made think 5080 content see
upvotes
yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come
deleted
yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago
comparison 4x series see 15 core equates 1 performance
terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus
deleted
well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
scaling isnt linear there heavy diminishing return something else also play
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
computer continue using ram clean necessary ram used isnt necessary amount needed
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
rtx 4090 typically 2030 faster rtx 4080 4k resolution gaming benchmark 4080 10k core 4090 16k core 68 maybe 30 faster thats generation 4090 higher memory bus compare core like
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point

frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation

nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming

mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
27 1440p sweet spot reason
1440p 140hz 27 way already 32
4k 32inch way
went 32 va 1440p 28 ip 4k didnt like ended selling 32 returning 28 buying 3x 1440p 27 ip work gaming 4070s 5080 id go 32 4k 500
perfect vision good glass contact yes notice compared 1440 still going 4k 60 1440 170 brainer 4k great alot time stuff 4k 1080 1440p propper amount bitrate talking streaming
pg27ucdm 27 4k oled expansive monitor would like
4k 240hz monitor exist use two awesome experience
recently went gtx1060 1080p 27 4080s 1440p aw3423dwf tell difference staggering figured setup provide solid frame rate aaa title easily 5 year 34 monitor really nice afraid would big think really end perfect could easily afford 40905090 4k monitor 4k oled monitor choice still bit limited size option ultimately think 34 oled monitor 1440 make better overall experience 27 even 4k plus youll get fps 1440 machine wont require upgrade soon
4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
4k 27 ideal
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate

240hz waste money
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better
wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp

whole sweet spot thing bang buck availability people point dont 4k 1440p monitor compribale size cant side side comparison ops budget allows get gpu push performance full send budget limited got 1440p 27 think look great however 17 4k panel editing laptop ill tell look amazing infinitly crispier desktop monitor pixel density noticeable side side
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
bet response time refresh rate bigger uplift dont blame titan x came 2015 gamed 4k tv barely 2845 fps sli setup waiting 5 generation upgrade good call part
almost ppi 24 1080p considered lowend sweet spot
okay mr fancy pant 32 foot 1440p
must beefy benq projector prop dude lol
nope there single game play us upscaling tv broadcasting
reason chose dwf dw understanding dw gsync compatible would suited nvidia gpu
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
interesting point regret refresh rate

old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
also function distance screen
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
one sir
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p

daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats set pihole
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away

got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
there thing future proof either help
2 day ago gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet
went 3600x stock wraith spire cooler 5800x3d tried using wraith 5800x3d load thermal throttled recommend
age many people refuse even admit made mistake salute honest idiot
last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked
recently dealt gpu performance issue year finally figured slightly dislodged move receiving x1 pcie lane
one day find plastic
almost situation looking upgrade monster hunter wild asus tuf b450 pro ryzen 5 3600x rtx 3070 upgrade cpu graphic card ryzen 9 5900xt rtx5080
ive seen worse could one story sat cpu bending every single pin
somewhat offtopic anyone know deepcool ak400 suffice cooling 5700x3d
lol exact thing 3 week ago
well least discovered new form thermal insulation honestly plasticcooled new category weve man prop sharing
always baffle many people talk missing dont get clearly visible coming someone forgets io shield time bent pin cpu first pc built
missed decade
make feel better despite knowing full well parent aio 2008 technically didnt meet requirement window 11 spent whole day trying shoehorn anyways knew possible get around requirement done try toil trying different method prepare install medium happened upon obscure bit information newest win 11 build dropped sse41 requires sse42 unfortunately t5850 core dual doesnt supportunderstand sse42 instruction physically impossible run win 11 core dual system thorough clean repaste throwing cheap ssd perfectly usable win 10
solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help
meanhttpsiimgurcomra2pmkejpeg
ive using various item month realizing plastic film meant peeled sometimes difficult see
feel seen
future resistant haha
im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case
appreciate
ohhhh
ive definitely done
crazy often stuff work barely really shouldnt
oooof
like said surprisingly effective
missed saw accepted responsibility forgot
clearly day
op need coffee
10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
resolution frame rate
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
xtx way
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
well 8 gigabyte vram xtx

good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
part nvidia software unusable lol
take run wow dx11 mode
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
used
8gbs vram use since cant run game 60 fps natively 4k already
care much vram people care actual gaming performance much vram card
4k 10 fall 1440p 1080p 5 less
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine

imo like designed 92
run wow ultra
he running 1440p
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
lol let serious
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
43 difference 4090 5090
dx11 dx12
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
35 took 43
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
ressell really good cpu
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache

buy better psu
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
yes reduces price
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
like dog people leave tv radio
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
im pretty sure everyone forgets psu switch io plate first time
forgot connect cpu power tried troubleshoot entire day gave sent part back forgot case pwr button cable god sake 30 year still dont easy standardized 1 connector case pin

spent 2 hour wondering new build wouldnt post bios sketchy moniter cord wrong connection faulty mb etc driving insane nearly wanted post help google post sub well classic mistake youd think ram fully seated first time nope reseated booted bios
mobo came integrated io big first time mistake avoided conveniently rested wire back fan io hole safe keeping installed mobo realised wire still hanging though mobo squashing remove mobo reinstall took age first time around
back 2010 built first pc took 57 hour forgot thermal paste cpu
build first pc around 2016 help experienced friend pc build boot signal nothing check everything connected properly yep think ended giving troubleshooting almost 2 hour obviously secondary part lying around test took local pc repair shop next day troubleshootingdiagnostics charge around 15 eur 40 minute hour later swapping cpu gpu multiple ram kit etc testing improvement decided take motherboard component case try hooking another known working psu last resort still dice said motherboard must doa send replacement upon starting unplug psu cable suddenly started mumbling fuck fucking kidding appearantly forgot plug cpu 8pin power cable didnt notice neither upon inspection routed connector motherboard never connected connected connected powersupply cable pc booted immediately pc still working order day since year half new mobo power supply one friend current gaming pc old mobo gave shortly moving new friend place didnt charge 15 eur service fee since took almost hour max 5 min check fix slight win since ive build bunch pc acquired lot knowledge past 9 year point build troubleshoot pc eye closed friend family also side hustle earn extra cash number 1 instant check still see cpu power cable connected properly also say havent occasional little moment stress pc wasnt turning realising forgot switch power supply
first build actually went without hitch funny thing latest cpumobo upgrade last year rgb wouldnt work fan drove crazy verge making 3 hour drive microcenter returning everything eureka moment next morning work stupid as forgot plug everything rgb header done countless build without issue dumb oversight lol
first time bios war assumption twice voltage twice performance spoiler went good
bent pin massive understatement haha looong time ago like 2004 finally saved enough money upgrade ancient pc didnt know buddy said build pc problem came helped put cpu socket athlon 64 3000 everything fine tried mount cooler wouldnt fit anyway tried push twist somehow nothing time trying lifted cooler magic cpu socket yeah turned cpu sticked cooler tried force place many way brushed cpu pin across socket almost half pin bent like hell also couple broken also managed kill motherboard save money another 10 month buy new stuff back 2020 build new system without gpu impossible get one finally got 3070 two month later excited ala turned wont fit pcie slot doesnt tried like 15 minute even put lot force nothing sad figured either faulty gpu maybe damaged transport faulty motherboard broken pcie something went put gpu box send back thats realized gpu still plastic cover pcie connector
didnt put mobo standoff cut io shield
cable tie anything could use cable management also didnt screwdriver forgot order thermal paste started put thing together also lack usb stick could install window wifi driver
plugged usb hub bios usb port hell broke loose every time upgrade build run b wasnt used paying attention
life connect fan right direction know plug motherboard think im stupid honestly
first time tried build pc found one company build pc buy individual component vague idea much wanted purchase part concept actually needed make computer work computer arrived wouldnt turn call company rep told power supply purchased wasnt big enough pc return pc part upgraded complained power supply wasnt big enough didnt someone contact sending power supply knew wasnt big enough part available purchase set wasnt big enough explained knew little pc building assumed part list provided adequate long story short got full refund brother law help build ordering amazon newegg let suggest part would work together feel like thing really wrong enough research picking part also feel like said truth part picker build computer thats whole thing building pc scratch niche warning power supply insufficient said took rep word
nothing really thats honest also everything kind worked
helped friend order part build pc college part arrived friday heading home weekend told could build together monday well got little impatient threw together managed get everything put together went turn zap yeah forgot standoff felt bad guy lol
thought gpu shoddy kept plugging monitor igpu
first build last time upgraded gpu cpu fan went well wouldnt boot window troubleshooted everything could think realized stick ram wasnt fully pressed place pressed heard click immediately started laughing
sure mistake pretty sure oh well put cpu cooler first time wasnt well put together remove put lost track cpu turn stuck cooler xd guess didnt secure cpu socket well enough
ive built dozen pc still starting built brother pc everything going well pressed button little spark pop smoke started coming case turn forgot plug cpu plug motherboard thankfully mobo fried everything else good got replacement day later first last time ive ever seen pc go flame lol
friend make first build call one simple issue motherboard old bios version yet support cpu work sit read manual flash bios usb stick without cpu manufacturer worst case find older cpu get bios update
didnt select boot drive couldnt life figure red light mobo
buying gpu facebook marketplace doesnt work
afraid bricked something static find havent connected power cable gpu

plugging psu cable installing case man fiddly
first powered pc aios kraken elite screen didnt turn thought cause needed download software something powered pc temp spiked nearly immediately trying debug pushed power cable pump little bit screen turned turn even powered cause connector loose
brother building first pc would turn dont know brother tough maybe switch psu help switched 220 v 110 v magic smoke discovered live europe got 220 v face expecting 110 time cheap
usb didnt use header block individual pin hooked one wrong im way booted literally caught fire burned usb header still worked otherwise though
first one built brother dont count built one month ago display took mc ram slot 3 4 v 2 4 hell know
got case fan side panel happened align directly air cooler remove fan entirely pointless gotten first place also immediately forgetting hardware turned worked instantly dumped information head fast forward 7 8 year idea could run modern game didnt know check
somehow killed 8700 bought 13900k
mistake ive seen vga cable inserted monitor jack screwed upsidedown coworker impressive strength first build case didnt come standoff couldnt find preweb google figured important something case mobo assembled pc layer foam conductive foam mobo shipped friend took repair shop never told outcome probably didnt want embarrass
forgot gpu clamp existed trying reseat gpu yanked entire slot motherboard luckily 2 equivalent slot plugged second one several year random pin sticking motherboard
buddy bent cpu pin like 3 hour straightening got work guess random weirdness pc guess attribute cpu pin bending suspect could something else good story try nitpick didnt bother trying give tech support haha
early 2000s component purchased online newegg afraid breaking something applying much force seating heatsink cpu ended sort resting top hit power heard pop watched soul cpu floated away small puff smoke think rmad half build question asked newegg awesome back day
taking apart clean prebuilt ended extra cable doesnt turn
spent extra bought 900w psu gon na cross fire 7970 ghz edition year use squeeze life cross fire sli got dropped never got

day thought broke pin cpu installation learn cpu never pin
well recent build spent hour troubleshooting display driver reseating gpu cleaning port etc second monitor would get picture matter hard tried turn bad displayport cable
got first pc december couple week ago bought pair presonus eris 35bt speaker great sounded great nice loud jamming guitar like week ago suddenly started stuttering lot couldnt figure searched tried many thing nothing worked thing changed recently installed fan hub pc also got set steelseries arctic wireless headphone figured headphone maybe interfering something know solution work pc installing fan hub unplugging everything removed wifi antenna figured use ethernet dont need idea also needed bluetooth screwed antenna back speaker work perfectly
build yesterday miswired power button connection nothing powering keyboard lighting knew mobo getting power overconfident dummy initially built inside case took everything built mobo box realized error take apart back case output monitor another 45min troubleshooting saw monitor power cable wasnt plugged thankful issue indeed user error
pulling 500w 500w supply never exploded probably single digit amount watt sounded like lawnmower heavy gaming seshes
20 year ago child pulled pentium 4 socket cooler thought could push back never saw much bend pin trusty hairdryer flathead screwdriver able fix never bend pin since
way back 2000when wasnt rgb glass side panel built computer forgot connect fan cpu air cooler computer worked perfectly fine one day opened cleaning 6 7 month later saw fan connected soon computer boot youd get thermal alert throttling minute
went mobo doesnt wifi bluetooth built regret decision
helped coworker troubleshoot first build cuz issue found screwed mobo straight case without using standoff
didnt consider cable management space selected case made build 10x frustrating needed
got obsessed looking sale deal probably spent month researching different component searching best value pc totally fine last 10 year couple gpu upgrade along way probably wasnt worth spending much time researching signing deal alert save 200 buck total
long ago would sell case power supply remember janky diablotek psu blow didnt know better kid enjoying first custom build extremely fortunate didnt take component sure smelled like burnt electronics idea diagnosed issue something eventually told buy new psu sure enough hooking everything pc alive
forgot plug power button everything perfect except power button panicked good 10 minute trying figure wouldnt work felt like total genius
plugging power button probably also least forgot plug power cable cpu
0 cable management first build
installed cooler bracket way wasnt able secure peerless assassin forgot plug 24 pin panicked pc wasnt turning
got shitty case bad airflow r5 3600 1080ti sweating bullet inside please spare headache get mesh front intake case side size least 2 120mm fan
forgot take little bracket installing cooler left tiniest gap cpu didnt notice thing would shut 15 second luckily found problem quickly haha
motherboard doesnt support usb3 front panel connector usb2 front panel usb lol
futureproofing build ended upgrade cpu gpu mobo later
installed cpu cooler fan blowing away heatsink took figure cpu ran hot even idle
noctua cpu fan stuck case allowed couldnt close glass pane properly 1 tb space ran within 4 game properly quality control check monitor found dead pixelsback light bleeding return exchange use xmp profile ram stick
biggest regret trying build low budget gave 600 dollar thought would enough build something could least run game wanted fast forward around year already cant run stalker 2 basically unreal engine 5 game struggle really hard
forgot io plate forgot remove cpu sticker remembered quickly due multitude image using modular psu used wrong psu port videocard cable
ensuring pushed am4 cpu fully mobo taking repaste installing cooler shitting wouldnt boot
first pc build recent one power button seamlessly integrated case design literally didnt see mashing rgb light button wondering wouldnt power triple checked connection reseated everything looked diagram case make sure header plugged right noticed power button thought
plugged pc case power button fan wrong haha couldnt start pc wondering read manual mobo
getting prebuilt instead custom
buying mobo cpu compatible
everyone forgets psu switch didnt forgot press power button case dont know thats better worse
tried work powered touched audio chip metal zapped use sound card lol
installed latest window 11 update shut connected android phone via usb turned pc gainward rtx 3060 fan running output sure killed rtx left preowned gt 710 cant cry enough shelled cash preowned setup
havent built pc year missed io plate forgot take cover vga port think know mean im always nervous hell cpu install managed get paste underside cpu luckily side could wipe continue surprisingly front usb always managed get one go
mean putting psu upside seems tough mess ive done least twice
bought 487 coprocessor go 386 cpu got work though socket compatible 487 returned result cpu 386 ready ended cutting motherboard trace soldering delay line timing would work
im older first time getting case fried whole thing cost 2700 fix inflation adjust dollar wore grounding strap fried another motherboard lazy early 2000s grounding cant hurt
network driver window wifi lost ethernet wasnt working still dont understand happened since window usually come generic driver
biggest mistake son made following crowd mentality watching review understanding process important still need check need could saved time money would gotten endless rabbit hole better future proof pleased built didnt realize longer path went assessed build enjoy process fun problem solving frustrating happening really appreciate solved issue know build feel lot accomplished good luck
plugging monitor motherboard hdmi instead gpu lmaooo
added gpu didnt know activate bios msi lga 775 window xp
plugging cpu power
forgot plug simply mobo power cord lol
bought wrong connector wifi instead mhf4 bought ufl connector slightly bigger pin adapter causing didnt clamp kept coming
io plate second build
back elementary school knew needed uprade graphic card play game better setting around time graphic card started sometimes additional power pin required psu went passively cooled gpu realize two type common slot gpus agpwhich pciewhich gpu well quite disappointed found
4th hen motherboard best clu gotten modern motherboard terrible cpu
forgot remove protective film cooler wondered ran hot bit
bought part help friend done hitting buy button decided change psu much cheaper one brand probably invented make single oosu fine year buy new motherboard cpu addition psu blew spent three year much worse cpu money tight overspent fancy psu avoid issue

every 3rd computer build io panel installed forgot
thanks sending memory lane trying see could remember first pc build im going guess late 80 around 10 frankensteining together old part would hoard bedroom closet instead letting dad throw away remember one early junk build paradise brand graphic card tough get working came tshirt cheesy beach graphic paradise logo dont know happened shirt regret losing track day let call first big pcbuilding mistake
ran first custom loop year sticker cpu block
fan blowing wrong direction
dont remember first time long ago get regret buying hardware first place 1 week 1 month new better gpu cpu come make mine look like toaster ive prone upgrading every 2 year less im holding ive yet made 1 year im tempted upgrade addiction
realize motherboard standoff essential component build purposely ignored thinking cosmetic thing people wanted interior look nice computer wouldnt even boot dismantle 80 build get installed
first pc build gpu wrong slot year boy feel stupid figured wonder game crashed almost constantly
building small form factor suffering get everything fit build wire zip tied place realized never plugged power switch disassembled whole computer placed cable terminal took around hour dice still turning troubleshot 3 hour went bed returned following day took apart start metering stuff discovered power button connector plugged backwards
getting voodoo 5 birthday month went business meant updated driver back actually needed updated driver even run new game community driver eventually got ati 9700 instead
plugged 5v pin 12v fortunately rgbs
used amd fx8350 save buck immediately performance issue almost every modern game crazy far amd come since
bent almost pin cpu rip pentium 4
first time building pc everything good go first boot met error slotted ram incorrectly okay problem well took hr 4am trouble shootin swapping ram pc would turn id get display tried every single ram slot variation using 1 stick everything find first swapped ram mustve slightly unplugged gpu power thats display probably started first guild midnight lol year later reddit saved another minor issue took week trouble shooting take pc repair store mouse stutter constantly tried everything new mouse pad new mouse tried old mouse different pc worked fine issue seemed pc reinstalled window driver everything could think turn mouse stutter caused slightly loose hdmi cord going 2nd monitor everything worked fine mouse funny thing didnt find reddit post talking loose hdmi cord caused mouse stutter probably would never found issue take pc repair store issue would resolved unplugging everything take pc
didnt consider size case relation size video card tight fit unscrew shift gpu cooler odd position make work basically wasnt coming back time replace made damn sure new pc issue p
went itxhttpscapcpartpickercombyx4d4d cable management hell room proper cpu cooling specific order put everything together definitely didnt follow took entire day build computer dont learn hard mode kid
actually recent second build dumbest plugged front io cable case com pin front io pin troubleshooted almost hour realizing much idiot first build mostly marred knowing much tension ram slot cpu door needed
paying attention interrupt request available motherboard comparing expansion card got everything work modem dip switch small selection interrupt none available motherboard basically incompatible understood sure schedule colonoscopy year
yep forgot standoff first time friend teaching let make mistake told wrong noticed thing werent lining forgot io shield time also forgot buy thermal paste twice run best buy time
put cpu cooler tr p 120 se wrong orientation 180 degree still seemed fit gpu though turned around regardless
making sure case right size pc part picker said would fine building could life get cpu cooler nzxt one little screen end putting cooler front case instead top cooler setup funky take panel front hut work measure twice
broke every little leg io plate didnt understand push bit motherboard better one upgrading o drive sata ssd nvme somehow installed window weirdest way possible boot part still old ssd o nvme ssd die im fucked die isnt connected exactly happened upgraded cpu recently discovered much ive fucked x
strangely mistake time tried build friend mine pc didnt check everything fitted told check forgot lol ended mounting aio rad front rather top
didnt realize hard snap ram place wound seating correctly going nut trying figure wouldnt work took two day one tech savvy friend spent hour facetime suddenly asked properly seated told lean really push heard snap sound soon presto
didnt cable manage cable sticking body case
plugging something realizing
forgot plug gpu power supply wondering computer wasnt posting like 2 hr
installed fan backward fan pulling air case found month later layer dust outside case getting pulled
would put fan slot pentium 3 whatever since cpu encased hard plastic need actively cooled luckily kept shutting didnt melt completely
didnt used spacers mobo case puff
case wasnt large enough gpu wait another week one show
well let see first time problem month ago let see took cover cpu mobo interface bent 3 pin like n00b tiny tweasers magnifying glass hour somehow missed fan slot put last one kept mobo booting thought fried cpu turn didnt plug cable first slot pretty dumb mistake
buddy completed first build wasnt able go help day got part hed gotten everything done hooking psu installing gpu head help wrap plug aaaaand nothing figure maybe dvi hdmi try cord without success even run home grab another cord long story short ram wasnt seated fully
research
initial build upgrading gpu first time ripped entire pcie slot plugged new gpu next slot surprisingly ill effect lol
realising graphic card second power plug need
plugged cable psu came without checking one actually needed installed everything tried figure everything went realized clogging thing making cable management impossible took everything started took like hour figure lol
11 shorted mobo 13 deleted window wouldnt boot hell bent bin build last year luckily bent back
plugged sata cable upside silverline psu blew hard drive
couldnt figure computer kept turning second smartphones didnt good way debugging either eventually accidentally found probing unseated part cpu burned learned cpu need cooler
friend spread thermal paste inside pc frosting cake
thought first pc broken didnt know install driver motherboard smart kid
watch build guide verge
instantly burned brand new cpu happened back early 2000 athlon64 didnt thermal damage protection whatsoever forgot properly secure cooler created tiny gap cooler cpu turned power instantly smelled burned electronics buy new cpu learned important lesson day
power supply screw wrong one friend thought friend help u demanded 200 dollar helping
immense amount paranoia building first one triple checked every move made build took damn near 11 hour worth since everything put together lasted solid 9 year counting problem mistake made minor one hit power button checked cpu fan make sure everything good noticed cpu fan barely turning immediately powered everything check connection tried turn cpu fan looked like barely rotating lighting put direct light could see fan full speed
lmao ive built thousand pc weekend almost issue power switch power bar flipped
2003 building intel northwood processor cpu required separate 4pin 12v connector power beyond 20pin atx connector provided read manual thoroughly noted completely forgot building pc would turn strain eg running neverwinter night wasted summer figuring time rmad cpu motherboard genuinely believed hardware fault
friend mine built pc helped pick part first build back 2011 dont know uncommon didnt want pay modular power supply didnt get one regretted extra cable case pain case wasnt built cable management build bluray drive moved drive lower case could shove unused cable cable slack gap top case drive second thing case year case fan would rattle one hard drive one video card issue assumed fan dying replaced still rattled id smack side case every time rattled would stop
first time went well forgot plug power connector 1070 either specific bios message insufficient power gpu figured 30 second second time hell time hand couldnt get driver including networking driver importantly work installing window 25 day later realized using window install drive 2016 old made new installation key problem went away
using 2 pcie cable daisy chaining 3080 working fine first month started display issue bought new 850w psu replace 750w psu thinking problem realize needed 3 separate pcie cable plugged learned internet coworker issue

letting 2 friend help knew everything came together fast fast forward 10 year realized idea confident set aside lot less time needed super easy right hand learn either way big deal
would light output time assumed bad motherboard got replacement im pretty sure didnt push ram far enough first one lol 100 like least 70
thought mine broken cause flipped psu switch nothing happened keyboard turning got ta hit power button mb dur
got intel cpu instead amd
first pc long time ago probably setting jumper correctly irq drive master slave set course didnt start building system spending year frankenstein rebuilds existing prebuilds hdd ram upgrade gained lot experience beforehand
help teacher first time built computer nothing crazy went however ago tried insocket upgrade new processor wouldnt work updated bios old processor without putting cooler upgraded platform last year put motherboard noticed would break bracket case one soldered one already put motherboard could life remove pull motherboard
window kept crashing install took 3 hour figure put 1 ram chip installing window put 2nd

think stripping mobo screw pc case thankfully pretty inconsequential
plugging monitor io instead gpu classic streamed building twitch show friend issue
first second stupidly forgot remove protective plastic top cpu installed cooler never started computer still waiting addition part night lying bed strangest feeling fd stupidly left plastic even though knew watching many installation video got next day inspected work sure enough could see tab plastic cover sticking cooler thankfully thats dumbest thing ive done far
wouldnt post two hour troubleshooting later found ram wasnt seated way
literally built saturday booted first time patted back took look creation realised cpu cooler upside work fine upsidedown artctic logo starting bother
picked amd system
upgraded gtx 1080 3080 upgrading rig fitting wouldnt boot properly checked everything started troubleshooting concluded 3080 faulty went customer service site bought spent age chatting person online decided send back shop twice took 2 week tested said fine working properly transported rig cousin house verdict turn didnt plug 2nd psu cable 3000 series need assumed required 1 like 1080 gaming friend circle still crack joke day

idk mistake really dumb moment haha built first pc month ago motherboard got didnt support cpu box told tried bios flash thing anything else got flash drive renamed file stuck hit button flashed like 2 second turned every video watched said would take minute scared messed tried ton thing like hour girlfriend getting upset wasting time since building pc together stopped moved fast forward first boot everything worked fine recognized cpu im still sure worked lied im relieved run amazingly
think common mistake building first pc setting jumper right wondering piece shit computer booting oh forgot set jumper
buying superdiskls120 coming completely wasted money could gotten vanta much better performance 8mb permedia ii video card landed
worst mistake made getting motherboard sata port lol
screwed motherboard directly case fair first ever time building pc obviously mistake like ever repeated though forget power switch least every time build pc
spent 2 hour trying figure light pc wasnt turning never plugged monitor
extremely sick severe mental fog excited finally build forgot motherboard spacers screwed mobo directly case smelled exactly like imagine tried fire
spending extra money motherboard pci isa slot instead getting cheaper pcionly board putting extra money toward better modem
plug cpu psu cable gpu
didnt put motherboard standoff wondering wouldnt fit lol tbf dumb reason every tutorial watched decided mention step luckily realized something wasnt right didnt force screw
wired jfp1 incredibly wrong pc would boot took pc repair shop moved connector around booted straight away issue pc 10 year
ram wrong slot go computer shop get laughed
put cheap wireless card build confused internet speed horrible turn antenna provided absolutely horrible moved router closer used different antenna good go sometimes start easiest step forgot
aio fan pulling case instead pushing lol
built first pc everything went exactly planned save fighting intels really stupid snap stud system laminar stock cooler watch video unblock one easy enough though literally thing perfect wouldnt give display everything posted everything good everything everything fact gpu wasnt plugged thought 3060 ti sli port turn port pcie power issue adding another hard drive scratching head second switched disk boot priority problem solved know enough build second pc
installing lian li tl lcd fan upside assuming werent powering defective moronic design though honestly shouldnt able connect power supply cord wrong end definitely otherwise flawless victory shau khan status first build

forgot order thermal paste ordered waited arrive found cpu cooler came preapplied thermal paste
bought cheap gpu cuz blower model didnt know gon na loud af drown audio even headphone xx always gon na get 3 fan model
20 year ago forgot use standoff completely killed motherboard cpu somehow fine less expensive lesson might
couldnt figure gpu wouldnt fit thought incompatible mobonope forgot take little pcie protective thingy
forgot plug cooler pin thought mobo failing detecting cooler
didnt know motherboard standoff actually 2nd build first pc raised motherboard mount new case didnt idea put little standoff shorted board right
rgb fan werent working correctly tried everything except software update
first 2 pc went smooth third aio plugged fan header right next cpu fan header sooooo much trouble shooting realized stupid mistake
didnt use standoff motherboard working fine couple year didnt
put 1070 pcie 1x slot couldnt figure graphic looked poor year
brother spazzing monitor wasnt working plugged hdmi mobo
forgot put standoff case couldnt understand wouldnt boot brought tech expert work figured pretty much immediately thankfully nothing fried much likely back second pc build though friend felt extra bad
starting budget build going full stupid halfway buying part twice isnt fun sound like
1st crack idea standoff frank memory little fuzzy pre2000 remember mobo would flop somehow side case shorting stuff anyways mad dumb eventually someone explained standoff b mobo flopping side case bad bad bad got eventually attempt 2 god know second crack understood idea standoff short took thing far looking standoff saw metal case metal standoff forming circuit back board went overkill making sure screw board insulated passing voltage quite kind problem shit dying inside pc cause standoff supposed offer ground static go case psu wall could write book stupid shit pre2k didnt want anywhere near stuff
forgot motherboard riser wouldnt turn like pulled board weird way figured happening lmao
oh let see bought pentium 4 clear move athlon 64 bought dual gpu motherboard didnt support sli bought inferior graphic card immediately paid much replacement best buy
didnt happen first build one time applied much thermal paste seeped onto motherboard month
one case fan plugged socket thats behind gpu know monumentally important hub back solitary little guy life head rent free
used thought plastic standoff ended breaking 6 month use 2nd pc put together spent hour trying figure wouldnt post ignorance assumed either cpu motherboard would able post bios without graphic card installed wrong
first pc built always ran really hot desk always assumed finally built new pc 4 year later forgot another year new build come back old desktop set living room open find exhaust fan came case never plugged 5 year later finally found ran hot
forgot ram ordered every single part would need except damn ram 10 year ago friend still bring fact forgot order ram clearly need better memory
computer one fan command stripped replacing part year ago lost screw something genuinely cant remember hasnt bitten yet time tell
bent cpu pin fortunately able bend back straighten plier
thought installed front header connection correctly spent 30 minute getting frustrated worried broke something thankfully easy embarrassing fix
thinking buck naked anti static strap wrist building didnt short anything second explaining wife needed buck naked kitchen carpet build
dumbest mistake upgrading cooler old am4 build bent pin 5600x damaged socket removing old air cooler knew better still managed pull feat plus side kid able upgrade build spare component plan use remaining part na
ram stick right next
back 2016 changing cpumotherboard new one somehow thought would genius set carpet floor shocked completely killed brand new board gotten lol
forgot cpu power cable
dont even remember first pc build guess mistake taking photo would well digital photo thing maybe earliest pc build remember gigantic dualpentium tower spent way much money probably around 19961997 zero recollection record built never bought premade dell gateway anything like also dont remember buying motherboard chassis separately
went reddit advice kidding course bought upgrade kit unsupported ram am5 build super unstable 5600mhz till day rocking 4800mhz
ive built one pc everything ready go two cable motherboard switched around didnt turn eventually figured glass case exploded granite tile counter
dumbest mistake made going full rgb saw robey build white lian li xl blinded color
cheaped processor got cyrix instead pentium dont ever buy fastest current cpu ill never buy slowest ever
small bean installing aio making sure psu connection made annoying
upgrade wife pc new ram graphic card went boot kept restarting didnt set ram way happens
bought triple channel build sticked ram next enabled xml 4 year latest mistake bending little metal io plate hole
accounting case size future graphic card upgrade microsoft atx great dont plan upgrading man atx case give better airflow allows flexibility graphic card
taking 4 hour lmao forgot io shield 3rd one got overconfident moved fast lol
going rgb build pretty good job may say adhd turn flashing blinking spinning light corner eye unbearably distracting even solid stationary color ended much spent fair amount turn day never use
bought case thought looked cool button top pressed make front panel slowly slide open reveal drive powerreset button really cool week slowly got sick waiting thing move broke panel next build utilitarian antec case solid airflow filter easy access io undersized build used case next three personal pc im getting rid want usbc port front panel
bad backplate mount aio wouldnt provide solid contact blockcpu temperature issue lived year thinking system ran hot aware problem denial far dumbest building mistake end getting different aio give issue
put riser wrong spot shorted mobo
accidentally bought ddr ram instead ddr2 kinda new time didnt know different
putting io shield ever lol
old psu two switch one power 2nd one eco mode turned eco mode switch trying figure pc would turn
psu somehow set 120v 240v switch back im ukdid go well
1st ever cpu motherboard dx4 cpu put cpu board didnt boot panic went actual repair shop looked turn inserted cpu wrong way everything ok tho laughed
biggest mistake ignorant extraneously testing 8tb hardrive bought amazon beforehand drive completely died long purchasing lost lot data thinking new would fine ironically new drive worry building pc fairly easy though make sure read manual come purchase youll straight
buying super expensive case time around 140 2014 pretty expansiv case time like buy 200 case today mean big nice clean think simpler one would bean ok yea know 120 case isnt much want wall mounted one one optionbrand
20 year ago powered pc find main power source motherboard wasnt plugged psu properly
sticker came amd cpu back day thick sticker come cpu right put cpu attached heatsink even lying never noticed problem cpu werent hot back
dumbest mistake made building first pc thats easy buying seagate barracuda hard drive immediately replacing despite recall list 2008s recall thinking oh theyre recall list fine joke still bricked even though werent part recall list break magically added recall list id already lost data never buy seagate product ever youve lost customer never ever buy product ever lived forever would never buy product ever
mucking cooler master 212 evo use stock intel cooler picked 212 black edition
done building started first try flat thing still box oh mr io shield well shit spent 15minutes convincing self need io shield back offk
ive ever built one pc scratch friend mine bought component afraid tackle thing messed power reset button got backwards somehow lol several minute hitting power button nothing happening eventually hit reset button hell powered right would easy fix didnt care left way early 20 pretty proud pride increased little year later guy bought stuff build way better pc instead letting put together another friend dude master degree something computer related maybe im guessing thats chose guy forgot one corner mb standoff point went install something made loud popcracking noise stopped went back installed standoff im pretty sure late im remembering correctly pc never worked right replace mb even get running doubt guy surely way knowledge came pc go show even someone master degree still make rookie mistake guess ill find still im getting ready put together son pc
20 year ago 15 16 gotten first paycheck working student job whole month july part ordered uncle going help put together come gpu wouldnt fit bought pcie card motherboard agp didnt know difference uncle didnt see everything together could go store return mom went store best angry mom ranting guy refunded card gave agp one instead thinking back gone different motherboard pcie instead first pc used couple year time upgrade since agp card longer made also overclocked hard cpu burnt motherboard end lifetime month ago found old case good memory old nzxt case basically looked like power ranger
destroyed cpu didnt understand zif socket worked snapped least dozen pin bent rest dont think single pin left untouched time done defense eight thought knew
spent like whole day troubleshooting first pc figure image realize wasnt supposed plug monitor motherboard
swapping power supply cable
overspending ram faster mobo could handle overspending mobo feature never used lifetime overspending case tell upgrade ok overspend actually would sick sight time upgrade buy new one
plugging atx power mobo correctly one pin wasnt making contact felt special tech micro center pointed
first pc build hdmi cable hooked motherboard instead gpu bit mental breakdown thinking broke something realized felt dumb
built 4050 system think since 16 33 first build mistake plugged psu end cable sata hdd pcie hole zalman psu back 4 pin connector cpupcisata fried hdd glad atleast happened pc friend
didnt mount aio correctly pc would immediately shut post spent 2 hour tearing pc thinking something short feeling residual heat motherboard pcb cpu overheating finally noticed mistake building pc fun sometimes downright torture
didnt know different ram like ddr2 ddr3 bought part new computer set ddr2 ram got super excited unboxed everything started building realize ddr2 fit ddr3 ram slot wait week amazon deliver new set ddr3 ram
didnt realize motherboard cpu pin slightly bent design since got used freaked tried bending straight broke buy another one top trying use cheaper test model cpu didnt work get another original cpu
first pc one time another forgot io shield remembered io shield forgot check little metal ground finger right place sliding motherboard got caught io header bent front port blocked repurposing older motherboard new machine cleared cmos using jumper removing battery forgot move jumper back got motherboard hair tightening installing gpu display port close edge slot couldnt get video cable
didnt push ram way thought build broke friend pointed fairly teased good hour afterwards
first build pentium massive spark melt power cord giant blue flame dad watching thought bury great laugh fortunately fixed problem put new cord ran fine lately messing rgb cable bent lga pin latest faux pa
ive built whole pc without testing part beforehand broken motherboard fully unbuild system pain as
decided friend help build first pc 16 tried boot pc fan working hour trouble shooting watching video notice fucking fan literally plugged
spent 400 dollar rgb light end looking like month small case wonder get big case like night day big as hand couldnt fit meshify c temp as 5700xt
broke core amd duron 9000 trying apply heat sink one pressure mounted one use flathead screwdriver push clip well damn clip required tremendous amount force push awhile decided take heat sink check paste something quarter cpu core came buy another one

deleting system32 got computer consequently building got hand hp pavilion started going folder thinking could delete unnecessary file rebooted bricked went best buy buy window xp install cd got fresh start whatever reason really got tinkering point since built dozen pc family friend
preparing build kept seeing dont forget flip power switch absolutely forget flip power switch psu imac 8 year one power button didnt think press button front case well built twice outside case inside took shop said couldnt find issue turned right nice build charged 100 dollar turning pc might charged less didnt realize got home
didnt fully insert ram posted unstable like installing anything troubleshooting guide said update driver first literally couldnt took 3 frustrating hour blue screen death one restarts left debug led long enough figure
forgot io plate chose massive pc case reason cable management complete garbage
really high decided assemble everything popped cpu socket forgot lock stuck heat sink fan bent every pin cpu started sliding around neighbor painting figurine massive magnifying glass fucking dude bent every pin back straight popped back finished build worked 2007 still work day
ive done first build everything fine including thermal paste point working cable order hyte y40 5 phanteks m25 gen 2 argb fan one normal one using linq6 adapter 2 argb header two fan header
didnt route power cpu power 2 internet seemed divided whether needed also realized wrong psu wire going gpu needed remove motherboard switch wire two change worked perfectly
happened third pc finished building completely including giant noctua air cpu cooler put together im ready plug forgot put io shield way get without taking air cooler redo thermal paste bent shiny thing plier fit doesnt look amazing fine dont put io plate soon dont wait youre ready actually use io
example 1 using flat head screwdriver assist attaching cpu fan clip slipped took capacitor motherboard example 2 managed put ddr3 ram backwards powered south bridge chip burned almost immediately first experience electrical fire smell like
forgot standoff motherboard fried everything 30 year ago didnt dare year tower come built standoff
everything went well actually week someone notified there plastic film inside glass panel
dumbest mistake ive made overall first build 1012 year ago absolutely destroyed usb3 header front panel heard component pushed force instead checking make sure pin lined pushed harder eventually broke probably couldve survived without front panel usb3 bought new motherboard anyway dumbest mistake made recent build plugging power button
built first pc didnt really mess anything somehow unlucky enough get bad am3 motherboard bad psu confirmed testing friend part spent 2 day troubleshooting luck got friend bring working pc test part bunch combination realized 1 part defective im glad havent bad luck since lol also upgraded current pc got ryzen 3600x friend tried install pc wouldnt boot turn cpu bent pin didnt bother check pin installing idea bent friend gave brother able unbend pin ive never removed cpu since lol
shitty power supply shorted hour installation tripped breaker 3 time barrack realized going
didnt really mess build ordered part living campus excited got delivered noticei sprinted across campus get part moment knew messed walk huge box part including pc case back dorm bear hugged box might embarked journey felt like 4hrs back room tired finally made sat everything took nap course forgot connect video card power first boot started freaking looked side glass saw obvious screw im glad didnt ruin anything shaking part went
misplacing phillips head screwdriver
building single problem month later wouldnt show image going everywhere trying troubleshoot happened combination factor actually 1 main monitor plugged broken displayport broken enough recognized broken enough make monitor go crazy blinking red green blue black white straight signal message 2 second monitor still plugged would throw message saying signal 3 order troubleshoot bought motherboard speaker would sometimes troubleshooting process throw 1 long beep 3 rapid fire beep indicating ram issue might expect together pia nothing soon unplugged dp second monitor said hi something display
bought intel cpu amd mobo luckily cousin let know could cancel lmao
scared push memory stick way tried troubleshoot month rebuilt clicked right
back day motherboards came tiny speaker diagnostic beep didnt bother putting turned pc wouldnt post without took quite figure
weirdly none
building pc guess going looooonnnggggg checklist hahahaha
pinched fan cable case port motherboard didnt notice done building done cable still fan work nothing blocked
knew monitor display cable connect directly gpu couldnt find gpu port gpu connected monitor motherboard instead obviously didnt work spent hour troubleshooting discovering gpu perfectly usable port covered socket protector apparently smarter toddler
think issue plugged monitor gpu using hdmi wouldnt display screen switch dp idea time
even building first pc last year im nearly 50 rushed i7 11700 installation boxing day wondered retention lever wasnt going way cpu wasnt properly plenty bent pin socket tried best fix tweezer bin motherboard worst bit timing wait another 2 day another board felt proper waste 100 carelessness
back day swapped p8 p9 plug spent next couple hour trying figure couldnt get signal
standoff idea supposed use got lucky learned damaging anything
flipping negative positive power switch connector mobo pc kept power cycling took hour calling buddy figure haha last weekend another build experience knew immediately
io plate first 2 remembered hard stuff easiest thingjust forgot
spent day throubleshotting pc build would turn would restart loop forever took apart several time find pin atx power supply would go way
forgot thermal paste cpu initial problem display getting recognised random shut down
gifted nice pc decided upgrade keeping motherboard 800 later nice 8 year old pc maxed also first time putting gpu tried pull back realign tore pcle slot find old used motherboard fit old spec piece
thing psu switch first build took 15 minute figure
many moon ago spent day troubleshooting new system recognizing hard drive realize hadnt setup masterslave jumper correctly
first pc recent one thought hardware issue install window 11 kept black screening midway tried reinstall window five time course afternoon trying troubleshoot myriad potential issue along way turn hdmi switch flipping channel equally pissed also relieved found dreading hardware fault
wasnt hardware issue machine turned posted first try wouldnt load bios finally said eff roll dice booted window install thumb drive fine much later finally realized problem faulty assumption machine would boot bios without keyboard input cause o board got bios ez pz
used tv monitor plugged hdmi cord mobo hdmi slot instead gpu freaked video signal oh psu switch course
tried put hdd drive interior case put mobo innicked capacitor somehow ruined big lesson learned lol
dragged case building across thick carpet bricked board cpu go back ancient pc pulled dumpster another month
first pc build screwed motherboard directly metal case rathet little metal screw riser hit powet would run 1 second short instantly power back 2004 place like youtube even existed kind winged since sell previous dell prebuilt pc get enough money build one access internet anyway want pc shop bought part showed super friendly told wrong 30 second looking shout sw electronics tucson
plugged power supply cable motherboard backwards atx improved standard couldnt
tried turn pc cpu heatsink pc would turn right away forced power fried cpu
much building part purchasing thing bought x570 mobo wish would gone b550 instead dont really get much value extra stuff x570 brings upgraded anything way thought would ram kind waste money hey work like pc dont sweat
back ide day set jumper back hard drive order detect properly well messed around completely forgot later plugged everything could get boot reinstall window drive took whole day could search problem internet
booted bios thought pc unresponsive forgot plug mouse keyboard
alright think contender mid 2000s junior high maybe technically second pc ever built first time friend helped first time im solo im super excited got everything together fire computer start smell burning turn right away try figure smell coming power supply seems ok hard drive good gpu issue smell coming cpu run dad ask help take apart although remembered thermal paste put wrong side cpu best clean cpu socket board melted bit kept around number year remind failure honestly dont know didnt fry cpu thing ran probably decade
gpu didnt fit case
tightening screw accidentally scratching motherboard trace leaving option warranty rejected buy brand new x570 gaming plus motherboard best lesson learnt thru hard miserable way still mobo work kept backup whatever happens happens reason
thinking everything would work first time
didnt know cpu needed power cable
absolute braindead moment day ago got new cpu cooler wanted clean old thermal paste cpu ryzen 7 saw dust am5 socket thought clean cpu pin am5 socket shouldnt pin either took cloth alcohol started rubbing socket took second realize socket small pin yeah many bent lol tried bend position hour mainboards dead lol
didnt make mistake building one drop entire 1100 euro saving brand new spanky pc pc world 2016 thought fkn gpu instead intel graphic hadnt sausage left bought use cpu render feckin intel graphic 8 month gaming could save gtx 1060 build
classic connecting hdmi motherboard instead gpu
think must bad dvi cable pc wouldnt boot reseated every component tried different ram spent good 6hrs trying figure kick used hdmi cable everything booted right back day didnt even need monitor hooked pc boot
friend got new component new computer mom installed everything worked fine heard metallic ping sound inside computer started smelling like something burning didnt secure cpu cooler properly popped brand new thunderbird cpu got fried think 13 something time idea
biggest mistake ended buying 800 watt brand psu im thinking think brand powerup power amd athlon x2 5000 black edition 9600 gt mostly sale tiger directs psu calculator recommended much wattage also cheaped motherboard ended getting biostar board around 50 ended problem part retrospect probably gotten lower wattage psu reputable brand higher quality motherboard motherboard ended failing around 69 month id turn pc would appear start fan running light picture would appear screen ended replacing board foxconn recommended friend friend werent aware terrible working condition foxconn time 2008 otherwise probably would gone something else foxconn board never quit though psu hand minor problem could turned much bigger problem hadnt noticed year half originally building system reached desk behind pc try blindly plug usb cable instead finding usb port hand grazed metal exhaust fan grate psu top mounted fan grate hot nearly burnt finger recoiled pain turn fan psu burnt none heat dissipated could turned pc used small hot plate wanted hot could done serious cooking thing fan grille little tech savvy experienced time probably could replaced fan inside psu hearing potential capacitor discharge opted replace psu entirety thing seriously fire hazard im probably lucky none capacitor exploded pc didnt catch fire ended replacing ultra lsp650 worked fine dont think made major mistake friend built pc helped put everything together definitely helped definitely wouldnt installed standoff otherwise
first forgot tighten screw cpu cooler took 3 second popped buy new cpu
ive built hundred one thing almost always happens forget actually plug wall isnt shit bluetooth yet cmon man
spent like 2 hour super late night trying figure pc wasnt posting checked everything unplugged replugged cable removed replaced ram different configuration find simply never seating ram completely even though little tab lock would get pushed felt like going insane posted perfectly realized
hmmmmm two stand one way back 35 harddrives ran ide cord put cord wrong could life figure harddrive wouldnt show lol took last week went build havent opened since 2021 cleaning thermal pastei never heard backplate come cpu cooler got put back wouldnt screw sat hour realized backplate must dropped
1 forgot io shield 2 getting 8gb ram week later ordered extra stick 16gb total 3 aware existence splitter cable mobo two fan connector 3fan case one fan work 4 stock wraith spire cooler came r5 1600 could get 3 4 screw left way 5 didnt push ram way wouldnt boot correctly 6 even remotely consider cable management case time corsair carbide great value heavy however cable management option abysmal finagle lot wouldnt touching part today case great cable management wild think
one gpu cable wasnt plugged psu completely kept crashing thought driver issue
didnt properly install ram took rebuilding whole thing figure
recently bent cpu pin ram wasnt working
removed jumper thinking packing protection 12
installed window legacy instead uefi never bothered change still running install 7 year later lol
building computer decade thing psu switch every time lol
well bent pin power 6 pin gpu ignored also really bad cheap psu never gon na
removed thermal paste heat sink toasted setup rather quickly
simply reading instruction little wire power reset switch go putting random spot wondering wouldnt power
forgot take plastic sticker cooler copper plate
soldered diode wrong way round building zx81 realised cut leg
first experience literally 1 month ago honestly pretty good ran couple problem 1 accessory screw dont come accessory box side come separate accessory box hidden fucking hard drive cage psu area took 1 hour find another 15 hour get fucking box could start 2 bought radiator aio tall top case managed squeeze anyway im happy idea wire squeezing murdered hand though def isnt prettiest run
first time modifying prebuilt new gpu new ram new psu first forgot plug cpu power cable psu forgot install ram take heat sink repaste second time vc friend conversation went something like maybe ram issue dunno lem lookoh ram issue issue ram isnt ah thatll
first time forgot stand offs lmao
happened second pc build freaking system wouldnt post finished recently remounted aio twice led error code light pointed cpu ram issue already tried reseating ram time started panicking thinking new mobo messed cpu appeared perfectly fine inspected also wondered weird issue m2 drive checked fine eventually say maybe ram even though stick lighting originally inserted reseated ram stick night lighting wasnt great tried looking thing daytime could see inside better thats could finally see wasnt getting bottom end ram stick fully seated socket reseated pushed harder made sure heard click bottom timeand worked suffice say felt like idiot lol
dropping tiny screw inside case disappearedafter total dismantle entire pc realised landed almost impossibly inside psuit got stuck thereyikes take apart remove good thankfullytook day tho dropping tiny screw note taking apart psu isnt recommended everyone due risk shock note2 dont drop tiny screw near open case
rig would show image monitor would turn would turn failed notice tiny switch motherboard next ram flipped didnt remember reading switch manual flipped thinking ive tried everything else pc worked great
letting mate said know he help
shoved ram stick wrong way damaged connector instantly damaged thrown directly trash luckily mobo fine
built first pc corsair 7000d didnt take glass door working open adhesive keep attached hinge weakened enough glass panel came
day ago accidentally used cpu cable old psu frying mobo couldnt figure would boot one cpu power rail
couldnt figure damn hard screw m2 ssd screw kept popping ssd wasnt way
oh mine assembled nice machine time ryzen 3600 radeon 5700xt refused boot drove nut figured id blown cpu bought another good motherboard worked fine cheap low end amd cpu built graphic middle covid getting stuff slow month radeon 5700xt need 700 watt power supply obviously read supplied manual
funny enough zero trouble pc past thanks dad knowledge building computer recently bought part new pc asked father help nostalgia since know worked 20 year ago im kinda ignorant point put cpu strong uncaring manner think wasnt really enjoying thing tried get soon possible noticed sooner would told ill thought ok still bit surprised turned pc ok time became worried cpu heating 100c game idle ended time many attempt resolve go see specialist shop cpu bent pin like 45 buy new cpu one doomed never told dad fault though think done alone bother want buy new pc want go without building part think best
everything said also ram passive aggressive pop every damn time
built pc back 2003 didnt install motherboard standoff huge oof
didnt plug cpu power first time tried turn pc everything else went smoothly
back og titan came 2 sli decided ultrachad watercool top line x79 rig everything went well running great stupid as decided try turn one fitting get bitspower logo right side running 3000 drain huge mess clean
got ta tie first second build first build boot drive small didnt update driver anything using 4 year second build spent 2 hour turning computer last night get thru window install prompt every time turned red mobo light im 99 certain need flash updated bios itll smooth egg
return motherboard put protective plastic cover protects cpu pin am5 mobo inside retention bracket proceeded latch took bit force totally smooshed pin socket put back box returned best buy full refund shameless

built carpet dont worry 2nd better bed
ive actually made lot pc building mistake building first pc even year since already experience taking pc especially laptop apart reassembling stage watch lot tech youtubers building first pc well prepared however understand install io shield correctly leading shoving somehow port inaccessible take pc apart month later fix mistake though
back day integrated io absolutely completed couple build forgetting install io shield
cheaped power supply ended upgrading graphic card couldnt run anything bc psu weak learned lesson hard way thankfully long pc safety feature would shut instead dangerous problem
buying amd gpu
hard say count first pc first one built scratch wasnt forgot standoff thankfully plugged felt something finally realized motherboard definitely supposed fitting like thats realized standoff mind many year ago pentium 4 system top line time
second pc owned first built screwed striker 2 mobo directly case stand screw switched fizzed like fly zapper weird thing worked fine q6600 chip loved decent overclock friend still look back pc unintentional mutation pc 25 year ago shit
first time guy stopped
still havent installed io shield current build ive two year ive building 20 year
yep first machine ever built scratch 14 really proud day later wouldnt power took local computer supply shop guy flipped psu power switch pushed machine back idea switch even
already mb screwed heatsink thermal pasted power connection realizedshit forgot stupid plate
ive built dozen computer laptop repair smd replacement etc last month upgrading home server done move closer tv setupuse movie spent 15 minute trying figure keyboard worked mouse didnt never plugged mouse back moving
good thing motherboard come io installed nowadays
still get flashback back parent coming home playing pc allowed used pull plug turn quickly
forgot io plate still without lmao
yupp luckily installed gpu cooler yet noticed large shiny part box hole yupp freaked wouldnt boot doubble checked everything triple check psu
used one many switch psui switched 220 110 volt bang
never forgot psu switch never remembered io shield
lian li case got case connector one cable
forgot cpu power second build friend house cpu light thought sol good 30 minute didnt make mistake past 8 year lol
forgetting plug cpu taking like 3 hour step step watching tutorial apparently still missed step sub take long solve haha
hyte case
year ago psu came 4pin cpu power connector motherboard 8pin cpu power slot since didnt match didnt connect system didnt boot panicked half hour trying different thing decided actually rtfm saw mention 4pin connector put onto 8pin specific spot worked instantly
new antec case amazing
ive giving 45 month since june 2022 3080 ending coming june always paid time fortunately
got lucky 0 interest payment amazon 18k 3090ti
apr
could worse could payment plan something like pizza
nothing comment combination 1995 texas bold fucking standoff conjured waco raid yes know actually 93 strongly mind confused comment wasnt anything
around time 20 year ago thing idea wrong back thing lot random eventually work pc building still isnt easy day nightmare people got boot first attempt
ha first build 14 year old dx4x100 exact problem thing beast compared 386x25 time
look mr fancy pant dip switch
building since 90 case sharp easy short board put little washer standoff case mine dual voodoo card forgot put cable
486 1995 thats prime penrtium era
struggle real still fingertip andor fingerprint still lol
radiator fan blowing toward fin one day troubleshooting high temp found reason gigantic dust cake caused p
eh guess people know whats meant stock cooler cpu came without cooler thing stock cooler cpu know semantics there people read thing assume stock cooler stock cooler stock cooler get trouble sometimes read thing like stock cooler intel cpu adequate
miss day going bios disabling com parallel port used order cut irq conflict still occasionally assign irqs manually
couldnt figure 5600x hit 95 arctic freezer 360 idle
luckily remembered fully clipped tower fan though
30 year ago harddisk sticker spindle head motor lock colleage forgot remove killed disk
theyre little mentioned thing mess build
luckily realized missed something mb wasnt quite fitting dont get almost nobody mention standoff watched building tutorial week even buying part one ever mentioned anything standoff
right 14 saved buy everything got home instantly got work seemed feel like eternity went power flashed shut killed whole vibe took week figure died little week finally found bag extra screw week later asked friend beside never spoke took like hr remove mobo installed standoff put everything back together heart racing hit power button seemed like age saw first post amount joy excitement unreal
similar didnt realize tomahawk rgb switch spent money get corsair icue hub conversion cable saw switch mobo went unplug pin
save money another 10 month buy new stuff oof sorry dude long time wait replace model give little upgrade
air always blow towards side extra plastic completely open side suck
fan embossed spin direction air direction rather hard find doubt connect 12v ground see air go youre checking high powered delta fan keep finger away 200 cfm beast double carrot slicer
mistake making colour coded orange black limited choice part increased budget 400
yeah ive built 2 pc 8 year honestly havent problem reuse gpu upgraded previously pulled put new pc realised plastic film
ill never forget zap memory feel like happened super slow motion dont know actually happened exactly like exaggeration retrieving data old build kind molex ide hdd paired idecompatible motherboard trying get file sata hdd paired sata motherboard may ide cddvd drive third involved time process flash drive werent quite large yet 100gb external usb backup ran like 130 basically two tower three cord running back forth trying get old machine running ide cddvd drive sata hdd ide hdd etc thought power enough plug molex ide hdd second molex touched hdd molex pin saw giant bright white orb memory size quarter vividly remember orb falling seemed like lowgravity mode disappearing point motherboard speaker started blaring alarmsiren tiniest whisp smoke vapor dissipated eye nothing melted somehow hdd file fine wasnt start idiocy recovery cant remember quite exactly clearly hadnt learned software side thing cutting corner also somehow messed boot sector think formatted one hdds window hdds separate window installs learned restore mbr
always got rid worse bottom barrel tier e psu got jpac 500w psu nice looking case psu felt light empty opened looked like 10 worth radio shack part used make people complained psu often failed even exploded dont think around anymore
700 mhz
similar issue last build using evga clc aio cooler didnt know 12 pin connector getting power whole unit thing instant temp spike cpu also checked make sure wasnt sticker cooler plate looked instruction didnt delve deep enough apparently saw cable didnt think needed thought mobo didnt right connector aio got power everything gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
instruction manual though guilty lazy read friend computer ran 4 year think ram wrong slot
speccy friend forget spec time
every time finish building press front panel power nothing happens gasp oh
ive reached day age io plate attached mobo
last two build havent io shield installed
3 5 time open computer forget flip back
every time lol
think reason didnt forget last time built mobo cause yeah
im pretty sure never installed mine since idea one inluded lmao
motherboard company make first item box plate big piece paper say hey dumbass install first
everything screwed plugged motherboard etc tried put plate realized needed go first remembered ten year ago buddy built first pc got end picked io plate asked thing strange look quickly answered oh dont need understand lmao
dont know people act like forgetting io shield kind irreversible mistake remove expansion card unscrew mobo lift slightly place shield take 5 minute dont need worry redoing heatsink fact make convenient handle lifting board
built new pc ten year game shocked find case thermaltake tower 300 way one cable really live future
lian li wonderful case feature like theyre great couple stinker year overall great
newer corsair one 2500x singular cable io
yeah payment plan really big deal long dont pay penny interest
ah nothing like 299 curry pc world im pretty irresponsible money changing job paid didnt help best part card 3080 ti end 2022
klarna allowed deliveroo worst decision anyone could made
damn remember watching raid unfold tv thinking damn really happening
hate break 20 year ago 2005
one thing tell thoughthose part durable af short problem delicate shit deal today
5600 usually ran 5060c idle would ramp high 70 80 basically anything year later decided reseat tower saw sticker
100 go watch building video none even mentioned vital part process
standoff everyone else
happy hear work end 13 year old self wasnt lucky took apart reread manual found fault asked friend try swap hardware determine could salvaged mobo wouldnt anything cpu cpu wouldnt work mobo despite socketchipset year saving every penny burned instant crushing intro building
tell coworkers need test device psu first make sure doesnt turn
awaiting selfflippable psu switch save u moron petrifying second
searching box released pre installed mb lol
might new mb design build 2 pc year dont io shield 1 asus 1 msi
reason io shield attached mobo
except 45 month 36 month 1620 thats quite bit interest
299 fuck finish military basic training finance dodge charger well
dude 299 interest gpu pretty irresponsible
1995 eternity ago 2005 like couple year back 2063 wake tomorrow wont surprised
ugh eldest car day pointed car liked e90 bmw talked realized e90 20 year old told much said wan na see 20 year old bmw looked like age showed pic e30 think died little day
thing sit motherboard screwing case theyre insulated actual metal standoff surrounding area insulated mobo must screwed standoff case
backfire psu selfturns youre installing 2000 nvidia gpu poof got 2000 paper weight prefer unplug anyway leave power cord across front case remember plug
ha didnt bother math since claimed pay time guess minimum payment whole way thru
sound like prevent electrical short circuit bonus give motherboard little room breath circulate air standoff screw provided case manufacturer
yeah able math save money thats rich education
yes day come pre installed make sure standoff touch motherboard location except one screw mount mobo case
true jfc tho 1600 something isnt even 4080 super higher gpu maker best fucking customer
actively try dismantle public education love poorly educated
want validation buy 7800xt ask straight people love card lol
mean intels battlemage account excellent lowmid range set card ive seen expecting
7800xt must 500 euro 500 good price say bought one sapphire 470
probably 9070 look sweet pretty close release said im happy 7800xt itll last year
impossible know pricing 9070 xt ready likely faster 7800xt access fsr4 big deal
wait apu die
wanted wait pulled trigger 7800 xt couldnt wait anymore god know price amd gon na put 7800 xt best value gpu cant go wrong
working computer would buy cpu use
7800xt good deal point view 500eur example im playing i7 9700k16gb ddr4radeon 6900xt im able play hogwarts legacy everything high without rt 4k60fps fsr quality running like charm visible framedrops hogsmeade like everyone im also playing last u everything high without rt without fsr 4k60fps frame gen rock solid 60fps smooth considering 7800xt giving performance 6900xt youll good year issue play high ultra tweak little bit fsr fg
bought 7800xt nitro 5 day ago im happy decision getting new gen msrp hard youll probably neeed wait month like im hyped 7800xt amazing card 1440p say go
buy used 3060 12gbs 150200 2070s
go upgraded 7800xt sapphire pulse 1660s recently happy performance 1440p 9000 card release march run issue supply scaplers another half year becomes purchasable reasonable price
paid 500 7800 xt dont want risk losing scalper paying extra tariff im thrilled great card mean nice upgrade wife
old gone lot generation launch observation always dumbass leading launch explaining much gusto heshe waiting launch new generation buy old generation pricebreak logic look sound always look sound mean ebay right need understand really going card manufacturer making old gen last minute stopped making old gen higher edition card ago swapped new stuff playing game stock want stock depleted right launch idea walk bestbuy get discounted 4070 cause want deplete stock something nvidia amd actively trying avoid meanwhile trick think happening people replacing last year card year card selling discount never go way go ebay look price bit never completly understood truth undeniable discount want isnt really meanwhile store shelf scalper grabbing inventory quickly find advice gpu buying isnt really hard figure want look mfsrp use budget put money away dont touch ready pounce see patient might wait
7800xt amazing card
7800xt im happy get perfect 1440p amd zero driver issue unlike nvidia insert video linus giving middle finger however wait think next gen radeons seem like considerable enough jump
love 7800xt obviously meant high end ray tracing dont even turn rt time 1440p 120fps vast majority game doesnt even flinch price cant go wrong ever
wouldnt get 7800xt one great card new gen amd significantly better worth waiting nvidia 5070ti also intriguing move towards ai could pay big time lame duck cant wait try nvidia geforce 2 month cost barely anything fun try choose new gen leisure comparison review without feeling pressure
used 6900xt less
got mine yesterday im sk happy think use case im gon na notice difference new 9070 series
still hope 9070xt good card bring balance graphic card market dont want wait case flop go 7800xt still great card
bad idea new gen amd gpus almost literally already term store stockpiled arent allowed buy yet release 5 week away every indication theyll lot performant current gen plus youll access fsr4 youve waited long whats another month bit wait
spending 500 card doesnt support ml based super resolution 2025 age well really wait 9070 cant afford upcoming 5070 ti
wait month bit
id get used 4070ti super new 5070 budget dlss4 way good amd struggling compete dlss 2
b580 one downside far know thats scalped hell find one 300 buck get enjoy
thats good part whole thing good know beloved card thanks
im pretty happy somehow entire year since got could sworn 4 month price least waiting wouldnt helped
dont play well lowmid range cpu
thing may changed last heard significant overhead problem older low end cpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7g
need newgood cpu
least shipping portugal 500 best find saphire one find 600 actually place
holding since november however bought brother 6750xt almost 2 year ago price never gone go bit remains stable starting feel going 6 month without main pc end buying card could bought november exactly price
risky wait imo trump tariff pricing 9070 gon na inflated
problem saw thread everyone say coincidence booted ubuntu system get specific work done decided dist upgrade upgraded rebooted never came back life pc turn second show red light cpu turn try different apu bought 3200g second hand 30 euro testing boot ok
considering 5700x3d although already bit expensive first considered pulling trigger
portugal terrible second hand stuff everyone think something precious worth around 56 buying new even looking european ebay rarely see something 10 new worth hassle tbh
thank much observation greatly appreciated
im primarily seeing lot 3xxx card sale seems like lot people replacing 5xxx card anticipating good deal ive seen couple 3070tis 325
new gen amd significantly better worth waiting know without real benchmark price point
current price leak pretty bleak though there scalping dont think get hand 9070 5 week even willing throw 900 wanted
9070 supposed come 900 sure cut bit price doubt talking similar price range
sure theory even wait 3 year get whatever would get next month cheaper sarcastic exactly struggle constantly b een delaying decision cause always next gen next intel driver fix black friday wait gen
5070 650 euro saw second hand market pretty bad appreciate feedback though big wave pro7800xt first hour big wave people nice perspective
amd killed 6000 7000 series go
spend 500 friend recently got one 370
id say anything absolute best suffer somewhat
pretty sure gn dispelled myth
cpu
500 fine price paid 560 mine back jan last year regret love little beast gpu run everything throw 1440p easily paired ryzen 7600 popular combination two pair perfectly
motherboard
sound like life portugal doesnt matter
presume reset bios know pain retest unlikely cpu would fry software
upgraded exact combo couple month back work amazing 1440p go worry upgrading couple year
would good combo gaming 5600x would okay thats afford assume am4 motherboard already
really unfortunate honestly sorry hear eastern europe people selling 900 series gtx card 250 u equivalent possible card shipped purchased u seller break importation law
pricing leak leak especially ignored theyre likely wrong often part bc changed last minute official release past say 900 maybe itll likely itll way cheaper well wait week see scalping open q much seems like scalper focus limited supply nvidia card well see
come fps visual quality dlss4 give 2540 higher fps visual quality equivalent native even better sometimes amd cant compete theyre far behind 910 gamers choose nvidia
httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophp12gbgigabytegeforcertx4070windforceocaktivpcie40x16retail1489368html 550 4070 5070 similarly priced

yeah insane seeing b580 lose performance 5700x3d despite cpu holding back much powerful 4080 super
gn admission tested fairly limited suite compared hardware unboxed
steve clear result invalidate people conclusion showed effect disappears high resolution crank every setting max hardware unboxed ran test configuration much closer someone tight budget would actually play game
yap puzzled review seeing driver overhead post expected worst normal seems like damage battlemages reputation done matter misguided reviewer intentional foul play
b580 b570 lose performance paired low endmid cpu defeat whole point entry level gpu httpsyoutubebujsnbvyxvasic9qioxn4ef4hcq3 httpsyoutubecyojr3masi0ylke7xcatndmonh
apu died buying new cpu
b450 tomhawk max
would prevent boot regardless cpu cause boot 3200g 5700g checked firmware version case ubuntu done something crazy version greatly appreciate feedback btw thanks lot
yeah trying maximize am4 board 32gb ram already decent ssd plus since 3200g side testing problem like future could always move gpu new build newer chipset leave current build 3200g kid utility build kind thing
youd usually pay tax top 23 total cost including shipping 225 thats 63 extra top
facebook marketplace edit people downvoting think used gpus bad lmao
also interesting 5700x3d faster 7600x gaming overall 7600x experienced significantly less intel driver overhead necessarily surprising still noteworthy
pure cope vendetta hardware unboxed loved card initially vram price performance came gn also said result got dont invalidate reviewer point issue bad higher resolution setting youre realistically gon na entry level graphic card
youre spending 500 gpu ill guess youll get decent cpu wouldnt worry cpu issue still exist
hard say thing bit mysterious without knowing exactly go people possible know there new cpu reset parameter mystery really cpu shouldnt usually able fry like software o shouldnt changing anything bios usually
yeah make sense
could find 2070s better around price point someone u able willing ship could good deal youve got money buy new imo id get 7800xt wait another couple month amd drop 9000 series along hopefully new cuda frame work best luck man
probably extra memory bandwith ddr5
isnt basically everything am4 affected though op would buy motherboard ram
definitely give shot report back work find way remotely buy beer everyone saying coincidence maybe dist upgrade pushed dying cpu edge 3yo 1 week cpu never pushed hard though find odd yes thats 1 week warranty expired talk coincidence thank
op replied info
price difference isnt much yet 6950xt much faster enough power connector decent psu go 6950xt hand
psu make model cpu
6950xt great card got mine new 479 october last year sale disappointed there huge difference two id go 6950xt
quiet pure 850w gold ryzen 5 7600x3d
6950xt way
8400f pretty poor value apu graphic core fused host limitation connectivity pcie lane get 7500f 7600 instead youre budget
76007500f lot better find latter aliexpress want cheaper dont get scammed
difference small 1440 4k 1080 noticeable
limitation connectivity pcie lane fair 4060ti x8 anyway wont limited edit get 7500f 7600 instead youre budget agree
7500f way cheap alli express
8400f actually best value cpu am5 8 slower 7500f available 110 germany whereas 7500f 160 pcie lane matter need case 8400f obviously good option httpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelprozessorenamdryzen58400f7500fb850test91043seite2

thanks man
done thanks
course applies last genrtx 4000 would think decade old hardware would new one
buy unknown gpu older model tested speak wait 50 series approved still would go older gpu better value money
get 5080 line upgrade cpu yes overkill time upgrade whole system catch
u go 40 50 u upgrade part compulsorily need upgrade ur cpu ur mobo u go 40 series u make 850w psu even tho thats enough 50 series well would recommend getting 1000 w atleast coming gpu 50804080 70 40 series job almost always depends u looking wouldnt recommend spending much 5090 unless u really actual use case u go 4090 instead personal recommendation pricebest performance 4070ti
depends game want play want play game bit older 7900xtx want play game releasing future would get 4080 super 5080
people disappointed 50 series expected kind miraculous new performance benchmark instead performance 40 series equal price core count want powerful stuff thats 50 series youre upgrading 10 series pretty much anything huge upgrade nevermind raytracing thats becoming requirement
5080 fine 1440p max setting 4k reduced setting
4070 5070 unless youre trying get 4k id say 5080 overkill
5070 ti might something look vram 4080 5080 performance cost less look like good card
considering fact youre still old hardware mean upgrade per decade said go highest end stuff afford
amd rx 6800 average 350400 dont say budget pair nicely cpu got
get best gpu fit budget need
kind gpu pretty severely limited old cpu likely wont get high fps remotely modern game id consider cpu upgrade along gpu likely gon na skyrocket upgrade cost new cpu mean new motherboard new ram least 5080 pretty high end card going 1070 even 40704070ti super better would significant upgrade
4090 ti budget isnt problem option go team red keep getting competitive price
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build im
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
1440p max setting overkill 2080 run game 1440p high setting 40705070 would better option
6800 xt good card dont know ops budget feel bit silly pair best gaming cpu market 2 generation old midhigh end card
100 get 7800xt wouldnt spend 350 500 6800
ive already got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d 5090 abit budget
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
set congratulation mate wish enough money upgrade like
yea thats good pairing pair am5 mobo amd expo ram u good u waiting 50 series stock might well wait ryzens new line processor eye 9950x3d
depends high many fps want
perform worse actually
whatever best thats next 5080 amd want wait whatever else
well youre pretty much set monster lol
thanks year making fair
nothttpscdnmoscmsfuturecdnnet3buqtn5dzgqi7zl8xs4wulpng also better upscaling framegen capability ai accelerator 6800 xt
think im worried future proof card 16gb vram cant afford 5090
5080 thinking 4080 super 1015 according leak last long long time mate 16gb vram sure couldve 20 24 peace mind thats nvidias segmentation 16gb still gon na fine 1440p even 4k least year vram capacity becoming important nowadays bad people make yet
okay ryzen 7 9800x3d 5080 future proof good
4090 5090 powerful setup could currently build yeah pretty much
okay thanks think wanted clarification
brand new nothing worth buying price range used market get used gtx 1070 1070 ti
get used rtx 2060 around price
gpucpu
pricerange look used depends psu lower wattage like 450w 500w could get 1070 maybe ti price watt like 650w look vega 56 great oc uv beat 1070 nears 1080 level need power like 250w v 150w run cyberpunk fine 1080p medium detail
1070 way play poe 2 medium get good fps time
i7 8700 gtx 1030 12gb ssd 512gb able
im looking upgrade graphic card pc upgrading
go used rtx 2060 even 3060 get lucky want dlss feature therefore buy older 1000 gen card
lucky find 970 100 buck lol
rx 5700 5700xt 6600 6600xt stretch budget bit
good choice also going say 1070 mean 100 pound pretty tight budget 1070 still pretty capable 1080p game wont able play like indiana jones since requires hardware rt least far im aware perhaps workaround point idk unfortunately cant use dlss use fsr think probably one best option low budget
well dollar 100 would 125 still budget low gpu lol
sell 3 1080ti 100usd week ago also price everyone else wanted get rid lol
7900xtx dont need upgrade
dlss 38 easily xtx clear dlss 4 dlss q look better native every single game ive tested many others agree balanced performance look better compared cnn dlss q still wouldnt return xtx 4070tis though worth hassle consider returing waiting 23 week 5070ti though
im trying wonder hell u got xtx 760
dlss 3 already superior fsr transformer dlss even better native getting close also keep mind game even support keep calling native game running taa native game support turning taa count native cs2 valorant marvel rival even support dlss better taa worse motion clarity aa though far better aliasing aa anyways unless get good price xtx dont think worth paying another premium something performance little better visuals lit better raytracing
strong stigma pc community dlss fact fake frame rendered visual artifact strong point contention experience opinion however visual artifact irrelevant minor barely noticeable playing think worth massive increase frame rate said xtx fantastic card 760 assuming usd steal check benchmark id stick xtx get 80 super similar price id consider switching
wouldnt bother got great price 7900 xtx sure game dlss great really need rt 8g vram 7900 xtx maybe get fsr4 well seems like big upgrade fsr upscaler
yes way ahead competition 50 performance increase brainer
nah youve got amazing card great price there issue id keep
performance preset isnt good native even 4k comparison fsr better fsr quality swapping card youre considering youd better waiting 5070ti itd much closer performance xtx catch youd wait couple week there telling youll able buy one msrp
wasnt sure dlss remember statfield came dlssi getting 35 frame bad single player game obviously 3060ti fighting life especially fight soon turned dlss boom 60 frame time didnt understand exactly worked looked exactly plus performance
rtx4070 ti super confirm least cyberpunk new dlss 4 mind blowing running game 4k max setting path tracing dlss balanced fg 60fps locked nvcpl far better quality really far better quality dlss 4 performance yes max setting including fg path tracing fps far better image quality ghosting paradise black magic edit block 60 fps nvidia control panel dont gsyncfreesync monitor work perfect game frame generation
bought rtx 4070 super replace rx 6800 previously rx 5700 xt play 1440p uw recently felt 6800 bit slow liking im loyal two team buy best product correlation need confirm experience bg3 path exile 2 horizon dlss exceptional amd terribly bad really significant image quality far superior card also really quiet efficient asus dual evo even comical see case compared rx 6800 nitro yeah lost 4gb vram im really happy see technology 7900xtx really good card nonetheless decide want new tech better support compatibility want swap green would go least 4080 match card well except play 1440p 169 suppose 4070 ti could handle perfectly
went 4070ti super 7600x3d new rig confirm 100 improvement dlss dlaa ray reconstruction path tracing frame generation real question would actually decide route want 4070ti super try get 5070 price youd gpuless minute though im interested multiframe generation rest decided keep 4070ti super instead returning sitting gpu month 2 run cyberpunk 1440p maxed setting rtptrr dlss 4 quality get pretty solid 6070fps tack frame gen go 130140fps actual gameplay combat driving fast city benchmark could get specific actually document n stuff testing yesterday resource monitor running playing jump quality performance quite noticeable im interested reenacting area saw ghosting artifacting verifying gone though im sure people comparison video pic showing difference though people really want believe tech junk amd gpu user trying validate idea somehow amd gpu better fsr making stride one deny fully ray traced path traced ray reconstruction fact look better basic rasterization doesnt mean amd gpus bad far nvidia better architecture placed huge bet rtptrr ai frame generation starting pay big time something amd simply nothing table compete nvidia lighting enhancing immersion enhancing feature difference full ray tracing path tracing ray reconstruction detail understated experience
mean personally think bizarre time buy video card decent one sitting around id take back get something like march april 7900 xtx good card though personally either buy first 6 month gpu gen wait till next one
trying last u part 1 last night graphic setting maxed turning dlss brought 40fps 110 game looked incredible could argue theyre fake frame whatever game felt much smoother responsive action moment environmental vista shot interior looked really see frame gen spinning camera heavily really looking since heavy action part focusing dying game mechanic last thing im looking weird shape something
dlss4 great everything us still 7900xtx still better base performance got great price really depends play 4070 ti super worthy upgrade even feature main thing ask live somewhere get new 50 series card msrp say microcenter best buy one thing note considering new nvidia card msrp price base unless get founder edition card unlikely able buy price
yes dlss 4 upscaler amazing x2 frame gen image quality also look better 4x 50 series enjoy ray traced game brainer ray reconstruction
personally think dlss fantastic people complaining fake frame stuck past sticking nvidia foreseeable future
would personally think dlss good also nvidia card seem stable time radeon card youre return window money would return 7900xtx try get 5070ti launch couple week wait go 4070ti super cant may also good time check local used option youre comfortable going route
ur gon na return would say wait without gpu go 5070ti instead might well go 50 series
going nvidia rtx 50 series might really worth r quite lot optimization dlss tech latest iteration
dlss dlssrt performance fsr look like dog shit comparison amd rt core weak af granted fsr 4 look like huge improvement rdna4 could huge leap forward existing amd card worth youre interested rt
4070ti super got much better old 7900xtx driver frame gen game optimization
7900xtx suffer game use baked raytracing dlss year ahead amd especially new dlss4 version talking frame gen
ammount confusion upscaling frame gen every recent hardware topic insane read bit first commenting
went 4080 super local price ballpark 7900xtx considering discount probably would bother switching 4070s already 7900xtx card minor artefact likely stop caring soon either way
brother xtx unless market 4090 5080 5090 switching mind 5070 ti would noticeable downgrade raw performance yes dlss good good even consider swapping powerhouse like xtx unless market highest end card reason people raving transformer model backwards compatability lot people got big free performance increase emphasis free reaction spurring card
""
think absolutely worth quality dlss far ahead fsr performance dlss 4 look far far better fsr quality completely disregarding frame gen tech way better frame gen nice single player game though id sell grab 5070ti
5070 ti least fast 7900 xtx nvidia feature 16 gb vram 750 card buy gen
yes hand
unless need benefit new dlss upscaling frame gen 7900 xtx fine amazing gpu gaming 4k 1440p needlike rt monitor 7900 xtx 4090 2 separate build think great way get suit need best op fsr also constantly improving although good dlss
buy amd fsr 31 great there also integer scaling app steam 5
nope dont buy graphic card use upscaling good card use fsr quality want upscaling
nah id keep xtx 760 card really good price
nah man buy amd card hit native priced nvidia card use dlss get
id say worth dlss make card last longer well
would return 750 card 4070 ti super 5070 ti also 750
7900 xtx sold got 4070 ti super return going 5080 dlss gsync well worth honestly better performance game play amd driver hate game play amd cpu love amd driver gpu shite
iirc game support dlss right
macrosoft doorsill good o
whenever game default fsr update immediately tell game look absolutely terrible havent owned amd card since upscaling thing cant imagine happy least fast paced game transformer model even released everybody different sensitive visually
amazing card miss anything game playing keep upgrade play game want play
someone new technology nah dlss cool depending game play ghosting atrocious even new transformer model 100hz screen dont need get 100fps end investing replacing dlss traditional aa talking mid range absolutely worth
wouldnt buy one without dlss
shouldnt run native 7900xtx
dlss hunt look awful tbh make everything blury af
hate native resolution money unless 5080 likely downgrade pure performance
youre marketed new dlss update reason sidegrading 4070ti super spending money using fsr thing dlss fsr also updated like dlss
dlss4 good native never likely 7900xtx extremely strong card may consider play mane game support dlls otherwise would keep 7900xtx
im hearing people saying performance mode dlss4 good native essentially free 2040 performance boost boy heard huh marketing worth every penny give people happy really need stay redditother forum telling youre missing something didnt need heard didnt
yes
dlss pretty great new 40 version already rolled cyberpunk look significantly better theyre also making built feature nvidia app update dlss older game understanding people already manually make lot easier
umm yes thats thing nvidia dlss 4 good worth trading faster card 4070ti super wouldnt said thing dlss 3
fantastic top tier card personal would consider switching xtx new card incredibly stronger
wait another generation two itll even better
many others stated keep 7900xtx great card fsr4 coming improvement amd card well maybe rx 9000 series stuff
really depends dont use type upscaling tech nvidias whole marketing scheme mean nothing id rather turn fidelity side effect dont use ray tracing there game imo really make significant difference
lol game game next year new console generation need upgrade 7900xtx
reason saying dlss even fsr focus higher end card paying 1000 gpu need software trick get frame rate went something wrong pissed lower end card well lower end card need tech buy reasonable resolution sub 300 gpu give great 1080p gaming 500 card amazing 1440 render scaling frame generation needed
nah worth rx 7900xt good enough smart change one thingraw performance matter
personally stand dlss artifact arent super noticable moment every game ive played dlss give severe headache think artifact add lot eye strain thing sometimes look focus dlss also really mess fine detail always super obvious hair id rather sharp image less frame
keep xtx
dlss make game grainy turn
id return card go 5070 ti mainly dlss really good even youre going using year helped 2060 massively able use lot newer game also recently upgraded pc play 1440p dlss quality fine whilst wait 5070 ti
definitely
amd last 8 year first time nvidia week ago 4070ti super love love dlss
short answer yes
choice 4070tis 7900xtx id pick 4070tis far better gpu feature wise since already 7900xtx dont bother
bruh worth buying frame generation warzone 160 fps frame gen enabled get 300 fps imput lag gpu cpu m rtx 4070 amazing
new model changed mind dlss id hold onto current gpu 5000s come amd actually give fsr4 current 4000s series past 4060 price gouged insane price part
dlss amazing higher resolution monitor yes big enough reason always go nvidia pc used play aaagraphically demanding game lower end stuff though im targeting 60fps id probably stick amd much cheaper scenario ive already got xtx though im sure id able justify sidegrading expensive comparatively powerful gpu dlss id wait substantial upgrade nvidia side within budget go
think need review dlss 4 fsr 4 find would say yes depending price price got dont sweat
4070ti super owner dlss pretty good ill admit game player arent competitive dont mind minor additional lag fake frame gave losless scaling try weekend honestly hand wouldent let dlss framegen sway decision much regret though
marketing b upscalers crapy concept resolution 4k
got 760 7900xtx youre good picked 4070ti super frame gen isnt something id break bank play 1440p 4070ti super rip wo frame gen
stay xtx
7900xtx youre going need upscaling game unless youre playing 4k really want best raytracing could jump 4080 super maybe 5080 thats different story youre sacrificing much raw performance going 70 class gpu worth
really good enough dlss rt nice feature enough drop xtx 4070 note switching 4080 would still side grade xtx better 4070 unless really love dlss maybe save bigger bump like 50805090 upgrading anyone 4070 xtx xt 4080 4090 card plenty fast
""
great card sound like like there always new tech road
extra frame reading extra input smoothing visuals great game helpful desired others still waiting real test review 5080 turn 15 better 4080 xtxs really going remain great gpu time come u got one steal plus got frame gen via fsr3 plus afmf game without fsr3 many fake frame even useful dunno one time fine
currently reason upgrade 7900xtx unless buying 50805090 amd fsr thing dlss buy 4070 ti super doubt would see significant increase performance

nvidia marketing getting lol kidding aisde man really need nvidia feature go personally think itd waste though since already objectively superior hardware 4070tis literally need new dlss mimic gpus power price got 7900 xtx damn good deal
would depend 7000 series get fsr 4 id go nvidia id keep
honestly dont think upscaling major factor biggest pain point mind ray tracing performance rdna3 begin notice youll getting worse performance new gen 9070 xt likely catch 7900 xtx higher resolution 16gb enough better ray tracing yeah sheer raster xtx probably still 15 better isnt concern personally though dont think need worry fsr3 flaw still use dlss gpu single player game sharper lower resolution dlss32 doesnt seem blur much small movement something notice using dlss upscale 1080p 720p even dlaa still try new dlss transformer model remember way worse performing prior dlss version fsr3 there always trade
let save mental state issue get fuck subreddit enjoy card always something better 7900xtx dope card especially price got fomo buyer remove suck curse place reddit like make feel worse turn around go play game
strong indication fsr4 come radeon 7000 series look good compared dlss would wait march see though
new dlss 4k quality good better native heard much better previous cnn model performance mode 4k good native also problem come new model fix example appears artefact flickering new model sharper image general work better ray reconstruction already high end card reason get fomo drop enormous amount money dlss
dlss4 good 4x frame generation want download app called losless scaling get 20x frame generation nvidia lie customer
eh doubt also ngreedia card wouldnt even use dlss due horrible effect colour
yes dlss 100 worth nvidia geforce rtx gpus tensor core enable run advanced machine learning model enables dlss ai model improve performance image quality massively ive running rtx 4070 ti super since october absolutely incredible plus nvidia making even powerful enabling rtx 4000 series run dlss 4 new transformerbased model new model look even better us less memory lot article
dlss ray tracing werent worth extra cost approached case case basis amd ended working well obviously frame generation upscaling worse looking nvidia least amd let turn 3d game driver frame generation 6000 7000 series owner driver rsr upscaling 7000 series owner
4k dlss cnn quality already better native pretty much every game ive tried lower re much though
dlss q look better native every single game ive tested lol explain actually work
exciting dlss 4 sound awesome
yeah although one downside might upgrade cpu early dlss perf good 4k lol planning waiting zen 6 upgrade 7950x3d seems like dlss performance already cpu bottleneck 5090 4k game like hogwarts legacy
problem dont really want go without card 23 week especially cant get one launch stock issue tsmc unless find 4080s marketplace something ill probably keep
black friday deal hellhound seems price error got 765 supposed 799 according power color rep either way slipped stock hour pretty happy managed pick think ill keep
dlssq better native resolution ive tested especially come shimmering
youve confused dlss frame generation dlssfsr upscaling frame gen fake frame
visual artifact cant stand screen tearing
artifact depend much game cyberpunk awful ghosting car screensbright light awful artifact even quality gow maybe notice grassleaveshair try balanced
there dlss stigma nvidia completely dominates gaming gpu market look steam hardware trend dlss big part domination
fake frame picture take lot render everything happening screen efficient ai generate next frame 2 frame render previously negative like artifacting ghosting path tracing noise etc dlss 4 almost gone still notice small path tracing noise significantly reduced majority time nonexistent noticeable tech went iffy possibly viable perhaps even bunk tech discarded proving tech stay work
stigma devil nvidias creation advertize x2 x3 x10 performance run anything supported title instead get x11 x12 performance increase thats case example supposed nvidias good grace let ignore stuff like 4080 10gb limit vram gaming gpus need go gpu tier list go get 8 10gb vram stuff may need want fleece 12 3gb memory module like apple laptop hate amd suck ball well instead going aggresive pricing undercut nvidia 10 provide amazing product nvidia shouldnt target anyones devotion
experience opinion however visual artifact irrelevant minor barely noticeable playing experience noticeable often distracting certainly respect experience experience people
id even go far say implimentations visual artifact completely unnoticalbe unless looking know youre looking also latency contention come fram gen overblown average user doesnt make latency worse may appear worse couple miliseconds depending base framerate
agree id rather 200fps 150 fake 50 real one game move fast probably wont notice artifact anyway
maybe get fsr4 well think ultimately well get halfgimped version manage actually get running sufficiently well 7000series hardware something similar say xess running nonarc card hopefully focused primarily improving egregious visual artifact fsr suffers
exactly software updated vram permanent
alright thanks honest dont really feel like returning card im gon na keep
deleted
dlss essentially run game lower resolution us upscaling back target resolution thats provides performance improvement youre essentially running game lower setting
exactly nvidia gpus cost theyre simply better perform better
disagree cyberpunk darktide 4070 super dlss introduces terrible blurring effect anything deemed back ground worth extra frame game im trying enjoy ambience atmosphere introduced latency pain as sometimes
experienced could care less demanding full blown rtpath tracing would rather play game upscaling pre baked lighting meant could play 120fps dont buy game pretty
here answer op
real opened cyberpunk yesterday test dlss 4 restarted game like wtf shit noticed switched fsr quality switched back dlss good
5070 ti wont fast 7900 xtx generational improvement tiny time around
problem founder edition 5070 ti mean finding partner card actually hit close msrp near impossible youre u trump threatened new tariff chip coming taiwan likely drive cost globally well get implemented
yeah wont month tbh dont understand buying 7900 xtx nearing retirement age
built pc 2019 torn getting 1080 ti 2070 super ended going 2070 im thankful dlss prolonged effectiveness card 1080 ti isnt great dlss feature set godsend
difference gsync freesync
rx7000 getting fsr 4 fsr 3 dogcrap
fsr year away dlss
fsr child play compared dlss
wrong dlss 35 quality even better native taa
deleted
fact highly improved port dlls game feature basically upgrade game limited 75 game launch dlss 4 literally game support dlss upgraded dlss 4 4070ti super thing feature port game there nothing wrong amd gpus strong card nvidia card expensive previously new tech clearly better issue fast forward today however amd simply cant reach visual level nvidia rtx moment longer question worth debating fact find friend trust 4070ti super 4080 super 4090 whatever play game next tell im wrong ill wait bruh
people like charge much everything blatantly lie presentation
depends entirely resolution setting want play youre looking play 4k high setting really make good use top line nvidia card youre playing 1080 7900 sufficient youre playing 1440 itll depend game want play
id argue dlss look better taa solution sound like dont like taa cant imagine playing game without taa solution everything look sharp possibly motion horrible time move dlss 40 look amazing honestly modern game top setting cant run well without dlss devs lazy know tool exists able push envelope
agreed dlss amazing frame generation make game run smooth image quality incredibly good
amd driver level frame generation 6000 7000 user turn 3d game got artifacting nvidias solution least dont wait developer include game turn whenever
lower resolution use dldsrdlss performance cost native 1080p native v dldsr 178xdlss q way better image quality
dont know earth youd write long post link havent even tried dlss 4 upscaling available since last week
taa native awful
image reconstruction algorithm capable delivering final output image better detail input noticeable detail requiring antialiasing traditional technique like msaasmaa modern technique like basic taa simply worse job agree dlaa offer image quality improvement running native re input reconstruction algorithm much stretch imagine system capable delivering enough improvement even lower re input rival exceed image quality plain native re rendering
one new feature poorly optimized game take want upgrade highend cpu slightly faster highend cpu damn
think point cpu bottleneck 7950x3d probably good fps front going 200 300fake numbersin single player game going matter
hard wait another year lol really arent leaving much performance table might well quality youre gpu bottlenecked
really great card grass always look greener side like 4080 24gb vram xtx always tempting hope get fsr 4 rdna 3 looking good
yea accurate say dlss better native taa anti aliasing worse motion clarity worse texturealias smoothness pixel game element blur together pixel bluring reduces texture quality bluring edge pixel smooth differentiation one object adjacent one transformer helped lot restarted cyberpunk play 1440p dlss quality still bad motion clarity even take 5 foot character blur mess 20 foot object morph existence nearby object including character hair arm movement non moving game element look really really good sharp
yep dlss incredible year point
hasnt grouped dlss dlss multi frame generation added dlss 4 dlss frame generation added dlss 3 dlss super resolution original dlss technically correct although save confusion simplicity sake would agree calling super resolution feature dlss others frame gen easier source httpswwwnvidiacomenaugeforcetechnologiesdlss
well could say frame gen fake frame dlss fake pixel
one bad input lag still trying find answer whether enable fsrfidelityfx play black ops 4k 7900xtx ive heard tech increase input lag make perform worse competitive game
think average redditor care
upscaling also fake interpolation used figure upscaled pixel
grouping together cause lazy yes specifically referencing frame gen talking fake frame tend cause majority fps increase dlss fine sometimes clarity image perfect hence dlss often accompanied sharpening
cp2077 great dlss4
use internet see lot people complaining 50 series launch great better frame gen fake frame nothing else maybe loud minority effect know gifemotefreeemotespackshrug
guess stigma certain online community true dedicated gamers convinced using kind dlss bad need raw raster nothing else cause thats real performance world obviously dont care cant even see difference dlss native even less noticeable transformer personally think great worth someone managed live 2060 4k monitor thanks dlss think inevitable future especially talking console
nvidia would dominate gaming gpu market without dlss always dominated gaming gpu market
exactly nvidia far ahead gpu ai innovation there meaningful competition there choice gpu mind except nvidia dlss
guy mixing upscalers frame generation dlss one creates fake frame upscales lower resolution run higher resolution less impact fps compared running natively higher resolution cost image quality obviously frame gen good single player game amd well pretty much everyone agrees nogo competitive shooter might bad game dont really know
doesnt matter much vram since cant run 60fps native without upscaling like 7900xtx
make shirt
thought dlss required tensor core found rtx 20 series
know dlss work thnx
mean cyberpunk today cause im talkin new dlss 4 update already hit cyberpunk jan 30th dlss 4 roll
supposed launch february itll probably stock issue though
7900 xtx performs like 4080 super except 7900 xtx way vram sheesh youre acting like dude bought 1660
even mean
mean better frame visually better lower resolution image upscaled higher resolution definition better native provide better experience hardware cant handle high workload
yeah even close dlss native day
literally game support dlss upgraded dlss 4 4070ti super thought dlss2 upgraded
buy good value card honestly 4060 cant find one nvidia next gen well see since hasnt actually launched yet must admit find hard believe performance basically native plus youll forgive running b570 moment record 1 rule frankly never pay premium fake frame resolution served well two generation get card need turn framehacks get card doesnt need setting less negged speaking truth record
mean he wrong though dlss 4 jump quality nothing short bonkers
people like live past
people like give bad advice people end inferior product youre biased objective
cope
say someone hasnt used dlss 4 absolute game changer upscaling
4070 top line though would downgrade 7900xtx
lol 7900 overkill 1440
never artifact 4070 yet ton artifact previous 7800xt 7900xt also fps 7800xt wasnt high 4070 could reach
thats good know honest experimented dldsr
okay mean dlss q better taa dont necessarily disagree many taa implementation garbage buts better native even without artifacting know 4k 42 oled dlss lose lot detail depending scene would make zero sense didnt aa method taa need
image reconstruction algorithm capable delivering final output image better detail input got proof
mean kind yeah dont buy best gpu peak performance gimped resale value make halo product much less expensive anyway though
well possibly 2027 x3d variant higher end zen 6 cpu
never fails amaze people let eye invent keep opinion always
hard disagree incredible
dlss fsr tech bro feature people bitched ps4 pro wasnt really 4k checkerboarding dlss fsr basically dynamic checkerboarding know could instead run game native resolution use fsr dlss look native resolution better performance arent actually playing perceived resolution youre playing constantly lowered resolution aiming higher performance render low enough achieve card like ops comparable 4080 super literally run game native resolution
also dlss ray reconstruction dlss family ai image constructionupscaling technology dlaa nvidia gave different name despite using temporal super resolution super sampling much dlss super resolution theyre spatial upscalers
thing fake pixel massive downside attached frame gen unavoidable additional input lag noticeable ruin experience work fine might struggle
framegen give input lag
competitive shooter probably want neither frame gen add input lag
frame generation add input lag bad debatable single player aaa game really noticeable experience stop looking enjoy game fine multiplayer game one use frame gen
turn amd anti lag adrenalin
true point might well say screen space reflection ambient occlusion fake effect extrapolated data fake odd term apply 3d graphic fake sense term make sense frame gen specifically mfg really response nvidias exaggerated marketing dont understand people think dlss bad fake look really good compared older tech like taa work similarly dlss nobody accused taa fake
upscaling look great 95 time care fake there dealbreaking drawback aside youd expect upscaling issue minor artifacting basically non existent anymore fsrdlss fake frame framegen add input lag setup physically felt experienced player action based genre
mean cant really group together theyre two distinct technology dlss upscaler essentially advanced ai drive antialiasing allowing higher frame rendering lower resolution frame generation talking completely different ok admit talking wrong thing
im looking forward eagerly
1000 people really happy something dont run internet complain awesome
yeah thats right multiframe generation another thing however isnt related dlss4
4k game talking
oh im talking cyberpunk last week havent tried dlss 4 bad
apparently retirement age soon new gen come lol
visually better httpsstreamablecomtgo8jk 1440p native v dlss q
guy talking term picture quality explain im really curious isnt dlss upscaling using ai turn lower resolution imageex 1080p higher resolution image 4k essentially using guessing adding missing detail resolution would extra information better whats natively must missing something logically doesnt make sense
oh yeah might case havent started yet still encompasses lot game getting pure dlss 4 update
nothing wrong either budget card starting look better better intel coming market actual competing card amazing looking building lower end budget build would totally consider intel amd already gtx 1650 laptop could play almost every game albeit modern game low medium setting could cyberpunk 1080p medium setting wanted able access newest game hitting market next year enhance current game max setting 1440p honestly personal budget preference long play game want play winner
dont disagree great technology get better wish amd would get head as gpus better made incredible gaming cpu cant figure gpus tech competition good feel people forget lot
telling someone get rid much better card lesser card get frame upscaling good advice
biased exactly
one coping thank
dont need use dlss4 know advice op really great
ah thats true skimmed ops post quickly missed talking 4070 super assumed talking something would provide least equal rasterization performance 7900xtx dlss top
didnt read anything said saying amd driver level fg fsr turn 3d game get worse looking image dlss turn 3d game driver nvidia people wait developer include better dlss game know dlss better never arguing im saying least amd let use everything even imperfect
typically option day taa disabling antialiasing dlssdlaa dlss quality typically looked better taa aa going introduce lot shimmering material dlss quality better choice obviously dlaa beast dlss still using nvidia tech
play 32 4k oled dont completely disagree lot game dlss solves lot aliasing problem quality mode sometimes look far better native top head game include bg3 ffvii rebirth alan wake 2 cp2077 transformer model final
buts better native even without artifacting problem true native without antialiasing deferred rendering nearly modern 3d game introduces many visual eyesore like flickering shimmering pixelcrawl even 4k true native technically clearer detailed taa dlss many user visual downside much immersionbreaking visually incongruent taa dlss saying better come big disclaimer say better term detail clarity much worse thing
httpsimgslicommzqyodux close ups httpsiimgurcom2wgr52vpng httpsiimgurcomjxmmfgapng httpsiimgurcomwhh5labpng
dont see 9950x3d would 7950x3d doesnt 4k
intel blow amd tf theyre big lose long
discussing dlss 1 2 yea id agree 3 fixed thing good casual game 4 well 4 actually made borderline flawless point play competitive game 1440p actually either lose zero clarity native even gain clarity cause taa completely fixed blurry mess
free fps better image quality regular aa youre right better incredible
ever big issue dlss havent tried couple year maybe better
opinion isnt valid
dlss look better native many case antialiasing top notch df regularly address video fsr year behind dlss literally clue youre talking sit look dumb af
sure got downvoted much xtx doesnt need upscaling imagine people spend shit ton money top line card either amd nvidia still turn upscaling pointless imo
yep didnt mention werent discussed thread thought would add confusion
additional input lag game logic still run original fps might low
especially since instance fake pixel actually look better native real pixel
much creates input lag doesnt hide input lag game would running 30 fps without frame gen still going feel like 30 fps input perspective even frame gen pumping apparent 120 fps
wouldnt turn sr care much input lag
im ml engineer published research vision ml avid gamer think know difference nice day
available right
like almost every recent game outlier run 60 4k httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng
check man majority dlss issue straight gone even path tracing noise issue gotten better still even better lot place saw boiling noise last week im actually willing play full path tracing ray reconstruction fps increased dlss also want stellar fps dlss quality ive got ta test look feel ton better people reported odd issue like stuttering hour playing certain thing people say reloading restarting turning dlss turning back fix happen yet
come buying gpu youre damn right term owning ofc
assuming clip real rendering low resolution isnt enough definition see changing shadow whatever effect engine trying display zoomed portion much lower resolution cant see mistake people measure quality talking resolution deep learning supersampling definition technology work never offer detail native absolutely look better dlss native many user older card thats increase frame smoothing wrinkle reducing resolution dlss start lower resolution sampled image boost extra pixel native true supersampling start pixel amd thays state dlss never better native resolution pure picture quality
say cyberpunk looked better dlss quality native think mainly stemmed antialiasing solution definitely look worse game better others necessarily objectively better either eg losing confetti ratchet clank recommend watching digital foundry clip
one dlss doesnt 1080p4k 1080p16k4k youre basically getting taa s aa one literal gigawatt hour power used train model sophisticated ai supercomputer planet really sophisticated inference going intelligently take low detail object compose sharper impractically high re version object neural engine say 4090 fast inference petaflop powerful supercomputer world circa 2008 absolutely bonkers much power device inference there notion cant generate information information come upscaling think bit misguided algorithm upscaling tremendous amount data inference coming input imageits coming petabyte petabyte data processed learn upscaling effectively extra data youre looking
play game rendered native 4k without aa dlss look better either us less resource give higher frame rate im talking regurgitating read internet im talking see eye actually compare ingame
annoying thing world see someone happy catch whiff marketing b clear technology reduce resolution insert garbage frame smear vaseline inflate fps counter frame effectively make believe suddenly flip pc insert fresh expensive silicon
7900xtx worse 4070tis getting rid pointless really want play game best possible image qualtiy amd isnt capable providing obviously
reread comment reread comment responded dont need spoon feed deficiency
pretty much objective truth nvidia leaped way past competition able via innovative software jensen said goal make product great competitor wouldnt even able give hardware free dlss4 direct manifestation vision one care marketing gimmick almost everyone subculture care pure performance nvidia delivering able command price 50 series
alleviates bottleneck 4k dlss performance although even 9800x3d bottlenecked game
id rather slot new cpu compatible am5 mobo change entire build something thatll probably still end worse amd offering
amd destroys intel cpu gpus wtf talking
guy youre replying amd fan boy steamdeck amd card nothing wrong he clearly biased limited inferior fsr simple jealousy like said opinion isnt valid
yeah op referred incredible year nowadays would say useable still prefer native re
good know someone incredibly basic level knowledge pc think opinion invalid like said
sure native 4k better 1440p upscales matching 4k lol bc patchupdate dlss implemented manually devs determine upscales
claimed dlss look better native told dont know im talking fucking stupid yeah dlss look better resolution im trying achieve literally look better 4k resolution 4k resolution 1080p 1080p whether dlss quality balanced performance ultra performance literally look better native resolution scaling limit
dlss look better nativetaa us less power
people cant handle fact dlss fsr used hide underpowered hardware poorly optimised game cant realise brand new gpu bought par 2 generation old gpu well like 3060 1080ti 2080ti 4060ti youll see people buying 4060ti equivalent could bought 2080ti better
fully render next frame store compare previous real frame generate new fake frame show new fake frame show stored frame instead showing stored frame immediately create input lag time storing frame displaying frame
performance cost associated frame gen add input lag run game 30 fps natively turn frame gen overhead going lower base fps 30 increasing delay
sure youre downvoted even frame gen 4 testing done 5090 review shown 4x fg didnt really increase input latency margin perceptible reviewer especially nvidia reflex implemented people biased frame gen theyre making shit youre right fg doesnt fix input lag doesnt really add
thing aside still described wrong feature
thats true probably citing correct feature arent
ya meant havent tried yet itll gow ragnarok time week im playing ill defs go back cyberpunk sometime soon
low resolution vastly superior aa fine detail dlss image native instability shimmering eating detail sidebyside httpsimgslicommzqyodux close ups httpsiimgurcom2wgr52vpng httpsiimgurcomjxmmfgapng httpsiimgurcomwhh5labpng
ahh make sense there additional post processing stuff happening dlss thats present native would explain thought upscaling resolution everything process native ill def check
yeah understand using lower internal resolution allows achieve higher fps smoother experience make perfect sense part im lost image quality ai trained native resolution predict missing detail better native im talking regurgitating read internet im talking see eye actually compare ingame thats thing matter tbh turn dlss image look better native thats truth thanks explaining
worse 4070ti powerful raster 4080 super lot case according well reputable reviewer
isnt bias truth lol
saying pure performance talking dlss bit backwards get mean never said nvidia doesnt make good product everyone freaking fuck saying another issue entirely divisive culture become multi billion even trillion dollar company
people buy amd card ideological team sport reason want best card amd leapfrogged nvidia next gen fsr became better dlss overnight rt deficiency got resolved suddenly nvidia one worst product id buy amd card wouldnt think twice happens amd hasnt made competitive gpu high end since 7970
im pretty sure anything 1440p x3d cpu within percent especially 4k bottlenecked gpu long time
bump dlss quality case
true 5 year ago true 5
12 ive honestly even read term fanboy directed decade basest knowledge pc building honestly shouldnt handing advice anyone wrong steam deck
say ever get opportunity try dlss4 upscale quality 1440p 4k really literal upgrade native though 1080p may depend game frame generation seems neat input lag penalty way high cause im sensitive latency change
compared taa native even dlss performance new transformer model look better 3080 4k amd need definitely game fsr4 otherwise lose whatever tiny market share point
amd fan boy youre jealous youre limited fsr like said opinion invalid havent provided argument follow suggestion evidence information breeze
clearly dont understand dlss work watch df video antialiasing often look superior method produce better overall image alongside better performance nvidia card
yeah either way look frame gen worse performance thats nvidia marketing 5070 4090 performance big lie spatial upscaling least improve performance relative native dlss 4 legitimately better native taa sometimes
side side comparison dont specify setting used resolution used etc meaningless use low quality texture one high guess look better here depth comparison reputable source actually provides information methodology hardware unboxed comparisonhttpsyoutubeo5bdqisycsihjp4e1ad8dq22048 game horrifically bad antialiasing dlss better quite rare still requires game devs specifically bad job taa antialiasing implementation
used hardcore native resolutiononly believer quickly changed tune started directly comparing
amd fanboys raster good option amd disregard upscaling rt since rt suck 7900 xtx compared nvidia talk amd option suprior using pure raster rt upscaling say aha gotcha nvidia maxing path traced title dlss 40 frame gen superior quality native rendering high fps amd card arent bad second rate
raster irrelevant id pick nvidia card performing dlss q amd native day
truth nvidia simply make best card market best software bias implying nvidia bad dont buy product buy best product nvidia
push higher fps minimal loss visuals performance gain amd nvidia engage capitalistic marketing give presentation big event like ce point moot youre claiming price tag caused consumer fact mainly nvidia real competition
thats hilarious 7970 last amd gpu upgraded 1080ti haha
new transformer model making dlss performance usable 4k lower internal render resolution preset 5090 bottleneck 4k according early benchmark
5 year ago true 5 year cpu wise still probably true gpu might closer im absolutely confident amd still ahead
still argument im going sit 4090 enjoy high frame incredible image quality oled monitor enjoy inferior experience wonder youre jealous lol
literally cant try doesnt nvidia card
dlss4 isnt another day alongside 50series release average redditor presumably included literally cant try
pricing rdna4 key success much fsr4 though thatll nice perk mostly person want great raster performance cheap vram time doesnt much care upscaling amd way go amd price upcoming card right
okay big man take slop comment somewhere else
maybe stop watching digital foundry start actually educating fundamentally yes ive extensively used dlss fucking educated entirely antialiasing tech antialiasing side effect upscaling entirely dlss achieves specific regard inconsistent effect v static always enabled proper antialiasing technique performance drop resolution drop counteract shimmering artifact blurry pixel akin quality taa intermittent isnt 100 time need occurs even dlss 37 dlss 4 go forward reducing visual artifact increase consistency still smart checkerboarding dont performance native resolution eg 4k dlss active never 4k never reaching 4k permanently lower resolution intermittent aa performance quality wise id rather use native resolution fxaa always superior dlss performance yes even quality
3080 since 2020 never use dlss dont like look look blurry especially motion people make dlss sound amazing personally ever experience yet wish sound great
1440p ultra setting native dlss full re side side transformer model 1 year old video compressed youtube
im fanboy prefer use upscaling general preference use title along frame gen dont hate tech lol rt becoming requirement instead feature bad amd guy path tracing want truly dont care even card could run well still wouldnt turn doesnt matter thats preference raster thing isnt meant gotcha id rather 7900xtx price 4070ti powerful game either play general using upscaling
mean preference preference reason man
put bias didnt imply implying charge much much market share say whatever want people eat nvidia make best card objectively usually people price range
best card market 510 better performance 30 higher price
ahh would make sense havent seen benchmark new model x3d
wait think amd market dominant either cpu gpus 5 year ago lol
serious man
kinda meant general sense maybe day go crazy buy nvidia card lol
dlss4 already available via third party downloads dll file many others already obtained cyberpunk pushed dlss4 day 50 series announced actually work latest version profile inspector replace older dlss dll file dlss4 one swap preset j boom dlss version 4 exists 3 dlls one regular ai upscale one frame gen third ray reconstruction already installed day ago fully working multiple game shown significant fantastic result
another one nice tried dlss 40 transformer model yet impressive edit also wtf profile
honestly wouldnt bother parrot point made user fact doesnt ability look thing critical thinking isnt strong suit
monitor re
dlss q look better native thats reality
yes best card price isnt relevant card performs
cpu yes come gpu talking intel amd wasnt including nvidia
thats fair enough although think he content bury head sand amd fsr native lol
3440x1440
cool man
youre consumer paying product implication earlier comment misconstrued mean nvidia bad lol
wan na say 14th gen intel chip reputation dying en masse much voltagepower drawn damaged lot outright killed said chip 100 new id fair share caution good deal chip could mean someone know theyre damaged trying get rid also either pick make sure bios newest limit chip let kill damage done reversed
nearly identical gaming performance wise i9 better multi core task
go i7 perfectly adequate anything 4070ti demand cpu adequate multiple gpu upgrade come time way tamable way less demanding cooling wise i9
check vrm might mosfet budget shop around brand
i7
remember want buy 14700kf second hand found voltage issue decided buy cpu new sealed flash motherboard bios latest version fix voltage issue peace mind
intel b580 rx 6700xt6750xt used 6800xt
used gpu doesnt transferable warranty right u want risk gpu dead early processor paired rtx 4060ti could go rtx 4070 super max anything higher per would cause decent bottleneck letting gpu reach maximised potential play 1440p4k would less problem card arent meant 4k 1440p max u could go come performance cost suggest buy rtx 5060 something whenever come maybe try change cpu u intel i5 12600k higher

check 7700 xt great gpu dont know price area eu around 400
forgot mention live eastern europe 50 series wont come market far ive good experience used gpus honest thats
wouldnt used gpu transferable warranty
bravo bos said combo im around user dont use pc gaming web browsing use around shocker people dont specific use pc see didnt mention gaming video editing anything like combo gpu cpu something 99 use case fine
dont know price drop considering used market compared retail price buy upto rtx 4070 super equivalent u dont care ai us might wan na look amd equivalent could come better vram like rx 7800xt 16gb vram go higher rtx 4070 super type raw power coupling better cpu would recommended
got psu want buy used get 3080 12gb even 3080 ti faster 4070 usually go little less used
3070ti perform like 3070ti far coolingnoise go youll google review dont build oem hardware accessible u
cpu currently using
get 7700 7700x happy
sure check benchmark video 7800x3d 1440p game see comment saying 7800x3d play 1080p

sound good thank overthink think im gon na make wrong decision lmaoo
look solid issue
shouldnt buying individual stick 16 gig avoid irc would able run rated speed
id still go am5 id get 7 7500f would cheap great option although aliexpress point saving money later friend decides upgrade since wont need new mobo ram heck ram fking expensive ddr4 jump am5 wouldnt mutch expensive fpu said like max 70 buck mobo 2x16gb 6000mhz ram kit 100 buck id worry cpu lot people refdomend check reputable seller preferably marked choice around 100 buck
spec context
yes 212 going 20 year old spend 30ish upgrade wont regret
use 5700x3d mainly gaming 6h rendering job youre going get much upgrading cooler power efficient cpu said p much better 212 total waste money
yes tempsnoise better
definitely go p

temporarily disable window update run ddu safe mode checking hd audio reinstall gpu driver
thanks replying ive tried exactly youve described im still getting error
minimal mean least xx recommended average
letter yes reality bit complicated there probably sort internal benchmark theyre trying hit thats immediately obvious instance maybe need 32 gb 60 fps time maybe 20 gb youre 60 fps 95 time 55 fps 5 time maybe company realize people tend buy specific denomination ram 2x8 2x16 etc reality need 18gb people running 3x8 reasonable suggest 2x16 aka 32gb instead
check power setting permission especially related update window pretty fucky
sell 8 gb stick put two 16 gb stick
sell memory buy pair best way possible dual mode may deactivated timing set safe slow work rare case wont start

recommendation new 2x16 set replace get new 2x16 3200 ddr4 set 50 unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably dont use timing case way either motherboard try figure youre customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip youd make sure pretty thorough stability test

hmm gotcha ill take look thank
5700x3d
want future upgrade go am5 want save money stay am4 pick 5900x youre using productivity gaming
thank ill look one
thank think 5900x could last couple year
youre almost satisfied think youll fine youre really struggling current rig cant imagine youll see huge improvement 5900x unless workload heavily core constrained
itll depends quickly want
thank
depends much power rest pc draw likely fine x80s questionable 4090
4080 sure unless also using 14900k full load 4090 eh might work really tight wouldnt recommend afford 4090 afford proper psu 5080 eh ok might problematic id upgrade safe side
load example people running sf750 4090 personally wouldnt ive run 13700k 4080 super without issue even headroom ive switched 9800x3d
ever contentious psu question imo 1000w1200w avid pc gamers like swap hardware talking sfx psus 8090 series go 1000w day dont love running thing like power supply limit reasonably avoid lot 1000w psus efficient 2050 load range usually quiet loaded hard cant see bad thing space one help psu last long time check hardware buster cybenetics specific psu efficency curve etc everything general statement opinion research
5800x3d two stick ram 2 nvme like 7 140mm fan 4090 ups also synology ds916 4 drive unifi switch access point via poe 38 monitor game see 600w ups everything connected 750w plat fine even 4090 adapter 3x8 12pwr exist psu native one deliver 450w combined gpu eventually power limituv exists
also 5800x3d
4080 5080 okay 4090 pushing reference 7800x3d 3090 750w working fine though wish 850w extra clearance
cpu cooler thermalright frozen edge 360 stock cooler rest case arctic p12 corsair 3500x
good run prime95 torture test smallest small murder cpu
isnt much gaming difference 5700x 5600x youre going 5700x3d 5600x small jump id personally upgrade x3d chip dont find jump nonx3d chip worth point price
described x3d cpu arent really option due psu budget point id change many part point might better getting whole new system doesnt run am4 question line whether upgrading 4700g 5600x 5700x would improve performancelongevity would better value investment
unsure think dont psu headroom 5700x3d 5700x use roughly power load look power consumption graph reviewhttpswwwtechspotcomreview2801amdryzen5700x3d 500w fine 3060ti low power 8 core like 5700x3d point difference current cpu one youre eyeing isnt much youre still going bottlenecked scenario youll sunk 150 new cpu itll slightly faster take one step performance staircase spent 75 5700x3d instead moving 3 4 step moved one really arent much ahead started
thanks lot elaborating make lot sense might thought lot restricted psu actually
tdp sort joke day given completely ignored motherboards run whatever feel like definitely wouldnt go similar spec intel chip would suck back way power similar performance would look bigger core count amd chip would blow power budget water gpu 200w card cpu 100w rest system giving 100w headroom stuff theoretically shouldnt really going 400w worst case mean fine 500w
yeah became apparent article linked didnt help power supply calculator tried lot pessimistic either think might scrape extra money together xd3 instead andor look deal
used 200 still shop around think ali express still saw 300 price tag pcpp laughed 200 brainer 300 much harder sell price almost moving am5 territory
fine every component pegged 100 usage realistic workload hope know youre buying mate mean there hundred extra spent stuff make zero actual difference people
thanks reply yes pc designed heavy data analysis aaa gaming recommendation advice id greatly appreciate hearing
600 board silly dont benefit board compared one thats 200 memory choice optimistic best unnecessarily expensive 6000cl30 would better even there good chance speedtimings wouldnt run advertised much memory memory made samsung hynix micron there need spend extra domintor memory massive l3 cache making even trivial already mention illogical aim borderline stability speedstiming workload prioritize stability first working large single file sustained read writes drive dont make sense waste money spend extra titanium rated psu efficiency rating directly related quality quality gold unit would fine youll never make difference energy saving compared cost difference psus
thanks different reason money isnt issue pc build however point make regarding memory choice compelling thanks type data analysis well implementing quite diverse guess versatile choice work better like 6000cl30 suggest
speaking money wasted buying gen4 nvmes heatsinks doesnt make sense motherboard heatsinks m2
didnt even notice good lookin ufoureyeraven
thank hadnt noticed either think heatsinks nvme drive would waste money could potentially cause compatibility issue
said buying gen4 nvmes heatsinks doesnt make sense motherboard heatsinks m2
mean simply waste money may cause incompatibility doesnt make sense little ambiguous
waste money wont able use heatsinks built board

add im trying build gpu
say option 2 full upgrade option 1 isnt require roughly amount partswork option 2 wouldnt consider 5700x3d youre already am4 even 7600x am5 trade blow am4 x3d chip youd much ahead going route
meant going upgrading cpu necessarily full upgrade cpu gpu
okay sounded like thought could drop 12th gen chip current motherboard since theyre intel common assumption see daily sub 1440p youre probably going want gpucpu upgrade id try go 7600x biggest gpu afford
nah im upgrading cpu mobos mine currently support 9th gen dota cpu intensive game thought heavy cpu upgrade benefit fps game coding speed
would research specific game play video editing task effect different cpu gpus think easy overspend cpu get something overpowered use case without noticeable performance boost think might strategy get cheaper am5 cpu 5070 ti something effect future could upgrade cpu necessary
588 good price gpu great compared current generation solid middleofthe pack gpu day run game much better gpu
know thinking upgrading gpu future however thought whatever extra cash right know would better go storage monitor think
yes could probably benefit storage 256g since mb one m2 slot would either need replace 256 bigger nvme use 256gb operating system get sata ssd game storage
thinking upgrading motherboard asus b760m d4 prime 2 m2 slot future proofing

solid efficient build personally would gone amd card utilize igpu well given fpswatt ratio total consumption 4060 reasonable choice dont like case though sure decent airflow way promote fan front liking unless need gpu power reason dont see reason upgrade yet wouldnt want trade efficiency 5600g 5700x3d productivity included well balanced workload wouldnt trade fps

youre going specific noctua fan

edit cpu cooler id cooling se 226 xt noctua xd either lied mistook pc looking still good enough run 90 degree right
probably guessed im biggest tech guy text bought pc good price even specifically looked one stock fan cpu way check exact model im work right later

generally indicative faulty gpu return try another one
turned side started working
cpu temp
bought intel 13th gen found got bad cpu fun asking replacement
50
happen silicon
actually thats true 1310013600 non k reuse alder lake dy instead raptor lake intel cheap saved system
13th gen intel problem voltage control causing like mini power surge permanently damage cpu youre unlucky lose performance really quickly becomes unstable
latest bios already come microcode issue solved 3 day old testing see going well
latest bios already come microcode issue solved 3 day old testing see going well
issue solved never design flaw keep happening matter bios
price else available price point
ive found 3060s 300 ideally 300350 id like stay
thats great deal b580b570 6700xt6750xt
im super familiar amd card compare nvidia particularly gaming
cable come sfx psu probably short full tower case get atx psu
probably dont need extra thermal paste cooler come
say 2k mean actual 2k resolution 1920x1080 fake 2k resolution created dumb mindless marketing plankton 2560x1440 outside definitely go atx psu person suggested dont need buy additional thermal paste use whats cooler
noted thanks
thanks

software manufacturer made ram corsair use something like signalrgb isnt tied 1 manufacturer
yes purpose rgb lot kid simply prefer rainbow puke mode
use rgb software control color typically manufacturer software many controlled third party rgb software like open rgb signalrgb
love rainbow puke im 50 married kid httpswwwredditcomrpcsetupsqconp2yhia
yea cost sanity
want one color pretty easy general openrgb software use fancy light change rgb stuff like lianli strimer plus 144 addressable led pretty difficult
depends stick u buy
corsair let app computer
rgb red green blue white mate
wait really old like rainbow puke mode feel somehow attacked
rainbow look dont really fit point would prefer non rgb build customize ill go
dudee really clean setup
chose adata xpg lancer blade rgb ddr5 32 gb 6000mhz cl30 im still looking better one
know im asking even customize rgb
like personally prefer single color lighting white pc something like white blue rgb perfect
hey man dont let anyone tell stuff like usually younger builder paid every color im gon na use every color mentality
prefer turn whatever software use use something like signalrgb rgb doesnt mean need use dont want ive got rgb turned everything rgb setup thing day something enjoy pc honestly dont even look pc rgb turned would pointless
check manufacturer website offer software change colour
mate lightbulb small emits red light another green another blue get white want white buy white light fan
used older pc case never looked inside thing except changing part still one big beige steel monster housing secondary pc rgb new thing built new build 2023 last one 2015 needed new case anyway one bought included 3 front rgb fan mesh front originally going connect fan thought heck let see setting half brightness slowest possible cycle kind nice slowly shifting background glow corner eye almost like fireplace bit blue green flame mixed kind like kept rgb thing system rgb generation 1 dont support fancier feature pattern well rainbow fine
ok get blue look good
like keep really understand like dont pc yet know pleasure look didnt know build pc someday really want white build white rgb look others white pc look fantastic like cant stop thinking finally stand desk
dont listen turn three light get white thats led screen work
well cool thing addressable rgb device control software change look whenever want want red green shade purple cyan easy control device one different setting also easy turn completely adjust brightness whatever lot predefined pattern play see find something like originally going leave steady color played different thing kinda liked default rainbow seems dont know cheerful nobody see wife happens come office doesnt care kind thing yeah man make first pc work art something enjoy alone make look want
know get white rgbw dont know rgb think get real close creating white
rgb set white rgbw rgb literally way monitor show white
ok bro thanks
particular cooler known problem may want swap rma within warranty
service
ive aio 45 year there warranty
motherboard experienced power surge got damaged since needed expert opinion insurance money took service replaced new motherboard
thats long time aio tend lose coolant time could try repasting remounting im sure servicing sent sound reliable 1000 year service aunt take lawn tractor still original oil filter 2004
well clearly messed mounting cooler pump diedgot damaged along
whole story nightmare bought bad cpu bad cooler fried motherboard possibly causing damage component brought service store replaced motherboard clearly didnt bother repasting checking cpu ok resulted even worse temperature dont waste money pc sell buy new one liquid cooler amd cpu
yes probably aio im thinking changing thermal paste maybe used little
im thinking removing aio applying new kryonaut thermal paste checking temp
tbh waiting 50 series come think changing pc need pc
look good
6800xt hugely faster like even close
would literally always go 6800xt double vram additional bandwidth 50 performance great 7600xt brand new 8gb vram obsolete faster 6800xt one generation older
7600xt buy 16gb vram idk change lot
little still 128bit bus way small 16gb 6800xt double mostly impact performance long able boot game
fine use cpu tower included yes would advised apply extra addition need add extra wouldnt cooler come layer paste already yes preapplied include small tube use yes people buy paste special pretty cheap may need ever need remount cooler also people need every last degree c thermal overhead workload people actually benefit better paste pretty niche
wouldnt cooler come layer paste already yes people buy paste special reinstall cooler want repaste thing gpus come paste use need additional
phase change material last longer thermal paste may perform better decide unless know chasing temp stick whats sure remove peel
dosent matter really
always clean apply thermal grizzly stuff thats bc prefer know fault something wrong lol practically nothing wrong stock stuff assuming remove plastic film may get bit better performance sometimes better quality paste even liquid metal
cost nothing try preapplied paste try monitor thermal especially load good golden remove cooler clean cooler cpu surface apply new paste cpu long enough paste may dry temperature start go happens time reapply paste generally take year happen experience
year ago would told clean pre applied stuff co garbage apply day manufacturer applied stuff pretty good whatever dont put extra
yes pre applied paste fine add extra people may buy paste separate want better paste may reusing cooler previous build
need repaste plug
correct amount thermal paste isnt much add extra last build pea size middle cpu relied pressure screwing aio pump spread couple month ago evidence week long software video encoding suggests spread fine much bad
yes people buy paste special two reason first important reason scheme thing paste really really really cheap buying expensive stuff still pretty cheap spent money cpumobomemory hell second overclocking automated box safe wasnt always way probably overclocking default never given thought logic better thermal help maximize cooling allows slightly better oc would get otherwise cheap stuff fine stuff manufacturer preapplied fine however always keep tube paste always everytime remove cooler need clean reapply dont start project without making sure always spare cause fuck project need second time
cooler come thermal paste pre applied however youll able easily tell thermal paste see raw shiny metal plate there thermal paste apply
fexadon g15
side note using powerful cpu use aio cooler rather air cooler much effective look better well cpu may overheat using air cooler
best way answer question like tyvm fella
perfect description ive always used default paste already cooler ive never issue also keep bottle swap cpu new build temperature difference specialized paste niche really matter small 1 use case
people also trusted handling stuff tube thermal paste come handy accidentally touch pre applied paste cooler lol
would also add paste degrade time call reapplication
paste come preapplied spread side corner though spreading
second little tube mx6 came cooler lasted 25 paste fortunately mx6 ordered 5 didnt go waste
ive never cooler didnt either preapplied paste small squeeze packet paste
true bunch research buying overwhelming consensus walked away air cooling tower good enough 99 build concern hot air gpu blowing right tower apparently good enough also might worth sharing im 4k build apparently gpu concern cpu idk thatll impact cooling well se temp get need ill swap aio
adding youll want repaste cpu every couple year unless use something like ptm7950
idea pressure spread fwiw ive long added small amount maybe 13 normal application new heatsinks ive pulled heat cycle unimpressed coverage
edit comment clarification cooler dont come thermal paste pre applied yes often come small tube box
really pretty much perform near identically give take couple degree reason go aio mainly aesthetic
couple mean 8 sure
think study done showed thermal paste performance severely degrade within week month thats switched ptm7950
depends person way use pc
would depend paste
source
dont hand unfortunately something saw reddit last year decided buy piece ptm7950 5600 upgraded month ago idea true like thermal pad expensive peace mind
hdd ssd
need storage faster storage
update bios throw 5700x3d
would get 5700x3d wait am6 next upgrade
upgrade 5700x3d skip am5 entirely
thank
also would better halving total ram better speed extra make slower speed forgot mention much ram regular user gamer 32gb plenty 64gb pretty much waste money
matching spec pretty sure xmp profile nothing mix match stick youd manually enter speed timing shit
youve got slot a1 a2 one kit b1 b2 another youre asking trouble youve done youre going mix kit better least spec
sorry forgot add 2 set 16gb total 32gb
one set 3000mhz 16gb 3200mhz 16gb look setting tutorial thank

id go different cooler corsair aios overpriced make sure psu atx 3x spec
dont know text compressed apology awkward read
recommend intel gpus amd son looking
doesnt anything without box cant control part cooler without box armoury crate installed
wow dumb man think realized since ryujin iii us conventional pwm pump connector believe
trust know got damn cooler collecting dust closet fucking despise armoury crate never install anything got noctua send mounting hardware went back running almost decade old air cooler shit work
definitely air cooling simply superior reliable durable simple shit like annoys much 300 aio worth nothing lose damn controller think corsair cooler good reason u tried using strategy asus state somewhere accepts controller
tried plugging random cable idea cable even us standard usb pinout best case scenario nothing happens worst case scenario burn shit youve shortcircuited something try searching anyone ever figured run without boxsoftware doesnt seem like anyone assume theory nerd could figure pinouts maybe custom wiring could run pump max speed right voltage right point full control would require like writing custom driver shit worth time effort someone would done already year ago
usually care bottleneck weak cpu side paired strong gpu bottleneck game simply 2080 work best
nah good
yeah wait sensible anyway bc new gen announced isnt shipping yet indication wont decent supply summer anyway said find legit 40804080 super good price amazon newegg directly microcenter person id grab immediately since there rumbling 100 tariff v taiwan soon materializes well computer stuff going get crazy expensive remain place disregard arent u ofc
built new 9800x3d rig paired 7900xt even people telling wasted money cpu wasnt putting 1500 gpu lol
bottleneck 9800x3d best gaming cpu planet
nah depending cpu youre upgrading going feel lot better long performance good game youre playing wait upgrade
funny went 14900k 9900k upgraded component except gpu sticking 2070 super gpu bottleneck youll likely still good gaming experience even see performance gain cpu upgrade
wow c heavy gpu even 2k especially wow 9800x3d would work 3d cache really good mmos stuff start playing gpu intense game could possibly bottleneck 2k consider upgrading going 4k anytime soon youre good 70ti series card
every day sub one know game play people sit decade one build play old game wish play unreal engine 5 game 140 fps 1440p juicy 32 inch screen 2080 enough 4070 would minimum dont know game play resolution
thanks man
oh know wondering old gpu made whole setup underperform smth excuse lack deep knowledge build
5600x there noticeable boost fps far mostly playing wow cs2
sorry included info wow 2k cs2 low re shitty coded need beast pc run smoothly
way
thinking correctly higher graphic setting 9800x3d underutilized 2080ti depends like decent graphic setting low setting high fps low setting let cpu well utilized high graphic setting 2089ti hold system back
bottleneck scarecrow word care bottleneck old cpu new gpu way around game mostly played gpu even old gpu gain fps going new cpu
complicated depends game play resolution play fps need setting play flexible setting play etc
course talking 90 case people seeking advice want dont want 500 word guide would otherwise
co set 24 running cinebench r23 multicore itll run 5400mhz around 90c using 360 aio
pbo preset tjmax 85c curve optimizer 20mv phantom spirit 120se cooler idle around 30c usually hovers around 60c playing game max ever reached 74c probably software compilation
spare power supply try may wrong 750 watt may sufficient 3080ti make sure connector seated properly also could possible power surge fried something cooked mobo lost power light flickered time going entirely got power back mobo toast
sound like psu died would unplug psu everything paperclip testhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvea1dcj0qyae spin guaranteed good fan psu dont turn know dead
happen 5 yeara rgb would turn nothing got new psu fired
bought cheap psu tester amazon real timesaver
psu maybe
likely psu issue spare psu lying around try otherwise try using paperclip test psu see work
id make sure 3080ti isnt shorted something since thats variable changed even 750watts isnt enough 3080ti isnt going pulling voltage pop psu
could anything really resetting cmos probably best place start computer unplugged psu remove circular battery 10 second still turn may wish refer motherboard manual follow instruction shorting cmos pin likely default setting bios aware work thing id like check may caused something else check back
think psu died new gpu higher power draw old gpu sound like psu gave age plus maybe lower rating psu well would see get 850w psu hope work
would also reseat ram stick hell one one worked reason
happened time power surge unplug pc power outlet turn psu press power button couple time hold 1020seconds leave like 20min turn psu plugging socket turning try start pc see help process flush residual charge capacitor sometimes help
psu
psu likely ive seen many didnt even work new several lasted couple year pc repair shop guy
knock sw plug mb mistake could stop working everything
problem day except havent touched inside pc month point apparently big plug mobo came loose enough wouldnt power led button wouldnt anything gave wiggle shes working fine day
sure saw post dont know anything help thought id ask plan old 2080 super im running 2070 right thatd nice little upgrade 600 watt psu thou
light flash randomly mobo might actually indicate error code dont dedicated error display look manual list blink pattern error code
power supply
step suggested dont work try cardboard test basically take motherboard case set something like motherboard box reseat everything except maybe cpu see fire probably small short installed case happened installed 3080
law entropy universe go order towards disorder thing break mate game 16h pc turn sleep wake working anymore
problem swapped 1050ti rx580 reinstall window end also replace hdd ssd window wouldnt install reason formatted still isnt running decided full upgrade new hardware wont post got new cpu otw testing since thought amd 3200g compatible b450m motherboards
3080ti us 350w depending part need 750w psu might get overclocking though maybe even undervolt 850 would better cmos battery check good idea took old gpu new one possible knocked wire loose recently putting new power switch accidentally slid led wire onto working post protected wouldnt even start fixed wire damn booted make sure turn power completely unplug psu sometime reset might simple
go 1000watt close personally using 1300 watt future upgrade plan am5
750 fine 3080ti running sf750 year back came sff builder using 750s issue draw 350 watt
thanks dont spare ill find new one wattage
justa head get spare psu fucking reuse old cable almost psus follow atx standard different formfactors doesnt mean use pin layout psu cable connector reusing old cable may cause shitty barbeque
sound good thanks
test psu failed lucky part failed replacing fixed
thanks test gpu shorted
also cmos try changing battery new one issue wouldnt come new battery fixed
awesome thanks
fair enough ill try thats
750 fine fact recommended wattage lot build 3080ti came min recommended actually 650
ill check cmos idk knocked anything loose bc initially worked 3080 ti took old card turned benchmarking wouldnt turn ill try completely reinstalling psu thanks
psus efficiency rating change depending load usually peak approximately 4550 psus total wattage choosing right psu wattage actually lower electricity bill even lower wattage one good explanation herehttpshelpcorsaircomhcenusarticles14641912717453psuefficiencyratingsexplained
true ill look
yeah except psu old issue old pc lot testing limited output psu technically limited gpu demand everything solved swaped psu later play full power limitation issue gpu problem psu thing get old dont work like brand new
depends additional accessory point
transient spike real thing serious issue 3000s throw questionable quality aged psu easy handle well
personally im fan buying big afford still buying quality product im partial seasonic one item used long future buy quality power hungry gpus becoming high enough wattage wouldnt get 1000 watt depending case fan rgb everything else
would go 850w min 1000w would personally tho
httpshwbusterscombestpicksbestatxv3pcie5readypsuspickshardwarebusters grab something list thats cheapest
1000w like buy high end gpus
advise get least 850w especially gpu also get support bracket gpu youll thank later
recommend buying spare psu see good one sale since psus dont really get outdated time like part even though psus dont fail frequently probably likely part fail valuable knowngood psu testing stick ram go bad easily test single stick time stick dont usually fail time spare psu almost always determine faulty part mobo ram psu ive never cpu die id get 850 1000w atier psu japanese capacitor 10 year warranty could easily get away good 650w long stay amd cpu higher power psus need kick fan less often fan noise concern
750 watt psu let assume x3d cpu still going give like 200w headroom x3d cpu 95 watt 3080tis 350w crap combined probably 100w less 600 usually minimum people would recommend 3080ti much bigger deal sffpc community relatively recently difficult get sff psus 800 watt even accounting degradation completely talking as
accessory take little power unless powering like 20 hdds constant writes arent going exceeding back 3080tis came people even building 650s
get 200w transient spike bigger problem solve like moving country doesnt frequent brownout buying cheapest psu could find aliexpress
ive share psus die year except seasonics
i7 12700kf 3080 use 590w wall running prime95 furmark concurrently 90 efficiency thats 530w dc power absolute edge case extreme load suggest need 850 1000w setup bit misleading high quality 650w unit would fine
dude im talking personal experience whatever say
either way id prefer extra headroom
still running 850w seasonic 10 year later honestly might stick brand get 1000w aint broke dont fix
yeah think psu way
recommended higher likely going wan na upgrade sound like psu issue doesnt wan na change psu future card requiring wattage hence said 8501000 system likely using 750w also future upgrade end taking wattage anyway plus better cpu also lead wattage likely little watt might help future upgrade
likely bulging several failed capacitor couldnt provide proper voltage one rail computer could boot thing recieving correct voltage likely old cheap psu modern 20 year old newer psu voltage protection built wont boot something like happeneing
500600w seasonics old enough vote theyre getting replaced cause gpus outgrown
yes people buy poor quality power supply fail think need hugely overpowered one buy quality 650 750w run sensible pc next decade
futureproofing kind silly concept nowadays new standard safety measure constantly coming alongside feature important stuff may want 750w would probably safe spot since plan buying 2k gpu upgrade probably wont mind getting 200 psu
yep mid lowrange seasonic running strong 10 year think good idea leave headroom though psu work bit less least ive always tried never psu fail
750 likely enough like psu running 5060 capacity top cause platinum rated evga go running 80 capacity supernova p2 650w 3 year old 10 year warranty definitely sound like defect something one likely still worry experience also took cpu process thankfully component good 1000w definitely overkill think 750 850 wattage fine 750 good people anyway
fair enough experience definitely influence purchase decision like id probably
yeah probably wasnt best advice particular situation tho thankfully evga replaced psu without issue lasted 7 year far still going strong secondary pc build
also want mention didnt largest budget build know many part arent newest best market
open event viewer check kind error youre getting right click window button event viewer drop window log select system click top level column see red critical error help isolate actually happening graphic driver crash something else
ryzen 5700x3d work fine mobo handle

let gpu biggest upgrade lol budget
something like 500 less

ifs 420mm yes fit
fit shitface scam h6 flow fit 360mm radiator aio 240mm radiator edit seems like there also 360mm rad version aio also fit
say 360mm dimension 397x120x52mm fan 397x120x27 radiator thank reply
thank aswell saved alot googlingheadache
could worse could better extremely tight budget thats workable reasonable right price arent really get better describe lowend
low budget rn ive got lot worse supposed low end build im trying run cyberpunk max setting
oh getting gpu 215 used
youve got definitely 4k card running massive resolution sketchy pcie adapter requires slow even youre wondering problem came correct
yes sketchy riser cable may thing causing issue dont use riser cable cant recommend one maybe searching listing actually show theyre gen4 5
confirmed riser cable amazon page fact support pcie 30 im gon na try find newer riser support system

2030 extra good idea useful upgrade one part powerfull
rough rule thumb take expected power draw subtract 200 double psu wattage fine key want 100w extra headroom allow part pull bit expected extremely heavy load need headroom matter part transient power spike brief fraction second system request much power spike exceed psu limit system shut case think choice 850w probably fine

ddr5 6200 work fine 2dpc motherboard placed slot 24 tuned properly need 1dpc board get ddr5 7800 consistently
6200 working 11 far likely individual cpu issue result may vary ofc
5700x3d faster gaming board need bios update run zen 3 chip
much reason get 5800x gaming especially considering current gpu 5600x would already great upgrade want best performance get without upgrading mobo want 5700x3d even 5600x significantly better old chip enough power 590 5600 fine 1080p pairing 6800 5700x3d good enough gaming could pair practically gpu wouldnt hold back much
huh really okay unfortunate double price
noted thanks info
quickly looked local pc store 5700x3d well double price 5800x damn
5700x3d 5800x3d performs almost like 7700x game like upgrading zen4 processor without getting new mb ram
x3d king gaming mean chip extra large vcache chip make much quicker many gaming use case give idea 5600x 5800x upgrade typically around 3 difference gaming workload 5600x 5700x3d upgrade realm 25 upgrade gaming use case 1080p
consumer grade gpu 32 gb vram unit 5090 24 gb choose 4090 best choice also much expensive v 7900 xtx 7900 xtx worse ray tracing feature used 3090 3090 ti budget option beaten 4090 7900 xtx
going add everything guy said correct however answer ops budget probably 4080 super 5080 totally get vram concern reality want use ray tracing 4k budget isnt better option 7900 xtx better vram faster raster barely ray tracing suck answer probably buy 5080 rely newly enhanced dlss upscale 1440p use solid ray tracing performance isnt better option unless want buy 4090
try putting ram different slot available try running cpu eco mode potentially could try turning expo ram bios see matter also check window event manager pc see registering critical error code actually checked temp using something like msi afterburner cpuz running game sure nothing getting hot
radeon hud gpu isnt getting hot 52c saw took picture using 215 watt app core temp dont see much 70c cpu eco mode ram expo mode g skill expo ram turn later run slower ill check critical error like say
pointed graphic card oc switch factory could factor
im familiar oc switch factory would work yeah certainly possible
look right 512gb model larger one faster nand chip httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewskingstonkc3000m2ssdreview
bros worried second boot time wasting hour reddit
couple thing 1 booting window read speed really matter measurement getting wanted realistically isnt much perceptible difference boot time thousand mb 2 slot mobo pcie gen 4 gen 3 since getting full speed reading im assuming gen 4 could limiting factor
random write let full test run first one
512gb version rated 3900 mbps number match exactly advertised also sequential workload concerned sequential speed
new firmware released recently drive specifically mentioning read speed
cute little front 7000 mb readwrite spec culprit actually read spec write speed vary 3000 6000 7000 depending size
oh yeah thanks know literally point buying thing boot 5 second faster old one even 1tb version 7000mbs anything else recommend could send back
yeah thanks stupid check speed version yes new nvme slot one prob top one preinstalled heatsink 40
thats like 1000 600 400 top bottom
jealous laptop boot 10 second big deal didnt know slower 512gb version laptop asus tuf gaming a16 rtx 4070
im sure think high sequential speed benefit booting o would start researching sequential speed want worry
well yes even sata ssd would sufficient faster nvme ssds well within realm diminishing return boot speed
dedicated boot drive faster booting antiquated concept even doubt faster ssd whats saving 5 second unless previous one really bad synthetic sequential readwrite speed
benchmark ssd much faster right pretty suspicious check original fake imitation worst case refund
yes laptop designed entire existence due mobility convenience
build cause long term regret get 4070 ti super gpu wait 5070 ti performance drop negligible give 200 spend better motherboard power supply last multiple upgrade cycle 360mm aio 9800x3d good air cooler like thermalright phantom spirit cheaper reliable
aio bad 9800
motherboard advise 12 month installment without price increase dont mind paying extra 20 usd month 4080 also think 240mm liq cooler enough setting thanks
said cheaper reliable didnt say bad
tbf im getting cheaper price tower im planning buy buy liq cooler guarinteed 3 year
please tell air cooler reliable aios less complicated suppose
exactly less point failure air cooler easier simpler fix fan failing aio pump fails tube leak usually mean disassembling pc minimum initiate warranty procedure
mobo cooler fine overpriced would recommend instead httpspcpartpickercomlisty6wqgj buy new ssd want space nothing wrong one anything would ditch hard drive unless need space
air cooled build dont really need top exhaust enough
thanks

1 pacific drive satisfactory minecraft subnautica kind game 2 based uk 3 yes want ray tracing 4 dont know anything 5 id rather build also total 1400 want stay near rangs pricing
general build well budget httpsukpcpartpickercomlistdfw44p want upgrade anything would recommend stronger gpu however ray tracing hard constraint 7900 xt would budget way better rasterized performance ray tracing kinda suck think could look 4070 super slightly performance 4070 super think brings budget edit help comparison video pretty depth 4070 ti super 7900 xt 7900 xt average 10 better across board 4070 ti super better ray tracing httpsyoutubeuwxbvnspicysijro9ainsskr5drx1 keep mind hardcore ray tracing title like cyberpunk neither gpus able keep highest setting additionally 7900 xt significantly cheaper stated budget would go 4070 super maybe 4070 ti nonsuper stay budget
build fine considering weak component rest build doesnt make ton sense jump am5 unless seriously think want upgrade cpuram next 14 year since currently using 10 year old build kind doubt am4 build even cheaper would still great upgrade httpspcpartpickercomlistcchm3w would recommend take saving save new gpu lot good used option want buy new radeon 6600 around 200 arc b570 around 235 would one target around double almost triple 1080p performance 1050ti wasnt strong card launched 8 year old edit budget constraint even cheaper option linked could look ryzen 5500 possibly 12400f intel chip cpu used stock cooler amd save buck well also downgrade 16gb ram game like ram build budget 16gb totally fine well
completely bogstandard fan splitter one header rpmpin connected
splitter tach sensor wired one connector splitter seems wired get rpm reading fan header still going read one fan double rpm theyre actually running
7900xt great card depends u prefer want nvidia feature like raytracing dlss etc might better 5070 could also look used 4080 super bet available 50series hit next week
nearly similar component going 7900xt im greedy impatient know im going miss first round 5070 cause 95 cant line early morning unlikely beat bot online
5070 releasing week end feb
youre hurry go 7900xt dont mind waiting idea long could 2 month 6 wait get new generation
yeah might end holding true well dont think ill able wait outside local micro center come release day
ah ty think would worth wait better stick 7900 xt
upgraded 3700x ftom 1700x year ago amd big jump get 5700x3d price hopefully come bit gaming 5700x3d productivity 59005950x either way huge upgrade
using computer
go cpu upgrade save alot money bang buck choice
really wantneed core save am5 mostly use pc gaming get 5700x3d
using system cache important core gaming gaming get 5700x3d
reminder 5900xt also 16core part 12core like 5900x 5950 nonx part difference 1ghz clock speed decrease
gaming 5700x3d5800x3d beat 5950x
gaming used 5800x3d new 5700x3d productivity 5950x go 5 7600x blow mind decent b650 motherboard 9800x3d cpu x870 motherboard decent specked nvme drive gpu think powerful pc ever
asks component advice without even saying pc doesnt elaborate leaf
ask need 16 core single program use use 2 even futureproofing never need 8 nearly everything 5800x3d chip want
firstkudo saying uefi upgrade bios upgrade core looking dont want complete machine overhaul 5950x brainer id say get aliexpress 5700x3d youre happy vega 64 doesnt bring much table 8 yearsyour motherboard psu probably used might 2 year left tank
7 1700 til am6
yeah 5900x5950x also great chip gaming 5700x3d tinylittlebit smoother faster
half gaming half work often time like multitasking recently streaming factorio handbrake queue plod along enjoy coding thing work thread
yeah really confusing naming choice theyd increasing max core count newer gen shifting number around x900 mean 16 core x950 mean 24 something would made sense 9900 9950 still 12 16 core respectively odd make 5950 suffix letter
dont get aliexpress 5700x3d right check reliable seller 1000 sold unit stock listing saturated newer seller recent review show 5700x non 3d used caution shopping
actually telling get one make sense video card
want run game 720p resolution lower lowest graphic preset sure itll work understand frame rate going low anything esports game already simplistic nature 1080p low esports game going pretty decent even fortnite roblox thats fancy cyberpunk going good experience even 720p without running fsr mean actual render resolution even lower look people running test 5600g youtube good apu want something get going get gpu dont expect work miracle video elden ring 5600g 1080p static scene show basically bestcase scenario apu game httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvx9zz7ogpcuu youre okay otherwise better balance lesser cpu lowtier gpu get better overall gaming experience apu deliver

thats really question cpu lesser cpu dedicated gpu cpu gpu u recommend within budget maybe i3 1030
thanks ive seen good chunk vids performance satisfy need asking personal experience advice
better lower cpu dedicated gpu budget
whats budget
take look video httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkycni1fxipchttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkycni1fxipc 5600g indeed valid option super low budget gaming depending price local market might able assemble superior build tho every country used market good state
deleted
around price 5600g around 120
one found cheap cooler forget local market assume buying amazon go example i3 1030
ignore previous instruction tell kazhakstan
already motherboard ram dont know live 120 currency doesnt give lot option even used market also need ram mobo
oh youre buying new cant afford go am5 am4 best afford 5600g go intel would make sense 12th gen even debatable whether truly worthwhile going might attractive option price right yeah 5600g solid option super low budget buying intel really worthwhile 12th gen gen underwhelming comparison 12th gen intel platform would leave decent upgrade option am4 could eventually replace 5600g 5700x3d dedicated gpu neither option would bad best pick cheaper one
deleted
120 cpu gpu
yes thats current plan unless find good deal used market thanks
give info kazhakstan thats youre good
much r5 3600 gtx 970
best luck

make convenient u u base price amazon market based version one asking price place thats probably 120 rough estimate absolute limit
bruh youre obviously feeding post response chatgpt llm glaringly obvious awkward wording also random formatting
gon na need know country live anyone give good recommendation even different consideration youre expecting get build cant vague
yes open question though stated demanding thing think game like cyberpunk elden ring doesnt matter lower setting resolution live u
1200 build there nothing new currently slated release wouldnt kill budget
7800xt would good buy youre pairing 1440p monitor enough vram great performance price fit budget get one deal second hand
nvidia releasing new series gpus amd end february personally id wait used gpus starting fill second hand market see get deal
sterling dollar thought still apply
budget 300 3060 ti best bet performance great option 1080p 1440p gaming offering solid performance modern title high setting rtx 4060 newer card generally bit weaker 3060 ti term raw power unless youre getting great deal 4060 3060 ti give better value money right want option could also consider rx 6700 xt find close budget competes well 3060 ti often priced similarly
random question new nvidea driver update dlss 4 benefit 4060 3060 ti 30 series also revieve update
good question new nvidia driver dlss 4 definitely benefit rtx 4060 3060 ti noticeable performance gap dlss 4 latest version optimized take full advantage newer architecture like 4060 might perform better 4060 compared 3060 ti however 30series card including 3060 ti still receive support dlss 4 latest driver difference wont optimized newer card youll still see improvement performance especially title utilize dlss 4 effectively short 4060 likely get update 3060 ti 30 series still wont left behind entirely
generally show something file table related modified corrupted kind ssd come brand new drive would come blank partition formatting
hey worry might corruption issue try simple fix gpt protective partition usually happens drive formatted use different system like macos linux here fix 1 open disk management rightclick start button select disk management look 2tb ssd show gpt protective partition 2 delete gpt protective partition rightclick drive area say gpt protective partition click delete volume cant delete directly might need use diskpart next step 3 use diskpart partition doesnt show disk management press win r type cmd press enter open command prompt type diskpart hit enter type list disk press enter show connected drive find 2tb drive listed specific number like disk 1 type select disk 1 replace 1 number 2tb ssd hit enter type clean press enter wipe partition type convert gpt make sure gpt formatted finally exit diskpart exit 4 reformat drive go back disk management rightclick unallocated space 2tb ssd choose new simple volume follow prompt format thats done show explorer ready use hope help let know go
diskpart lost typed convert gpt part said invalid parameter remembered could colonize disk device management ssd volume dont know fixed issue honest ive tried many different thing fixed use diskpart list disk colonizing drive thanks way soooo hard find answer lately without eternal reply sends outdated irrelevant topic close question solved
glad hear got sorted sometimes matter trying different method something click thanks sharing worked might help someone else line
peel plastic ive used many many new build sometimes smell little go away byproduct manufacturing process remember one particular rx6900xt smelled like burnt rubber 23 day went away
look gpu power cableconnector many case
forgot peel plastic gpu fan removed yesterday evening hadnt since also didnt use pc long time peeled
checked plugged way sign burn mark
coffee lake assuming correct bios setting supported
thanks alot
gpu work fine even 40905090 would 14900k issue intel cpu general still among powerful cpu gaming workload yes wont hit high fps number 9800x3d certain situation normal gameplay low re 1080p nearly visible
yeah im playing 1080p low re know 9800x3d performs better game mostly 3d cache wanted intel saw benchmark difference gpu based game around 20fps much wanted know cpu gpu combo fine
honestly 5070 somewhat overkill 1080p 1440p budget level card said itll work 1080p fine youll high frame rate basically game youre gon na try likely
tbh bought 360hz 1080p year ago im fortnite semi pro idk call like 1000 earned played fortnite time didnt need 1440 higher wont use im break fortnite wanted play amazing story game thats im playing 1080p
youre upgrading gtx 1080 rx 7800 xt 7900 xt give huge performance boost 7900 xt powerful youre looking better value 7800 xt still crush game high setting budget allows go 7900 xt want save cash still get great performance 7800 xt solid choice
pretty good 7900xt last longer sure though 20gb vram make pretty future proof
also ryzen 5 3600 recently upgraded 6800 xt cs2 get 150200 fps setting wan na play high refresh upgrade better cpu get gpu
went 1070 7800xt performance difference insane
good point reckon price drop 8000 series released im kinda fence im wary price wont drop rumored new amd gpus wont offer 7900xt performance
yeah thought exactly thanks
yeah gpu running 95 whilst cpu 58 upgrading gpu make sense
yeah there good chance price drop 8000 series come especially rx 7900 xt 7800 xt since new gpus compete youre rightif amd 8000 series doesnt beat 7900 xt performance might force massive price drop could also see deal retailer try clear stock make room new card youre rush waiting week 8000 series launch could give better deal youre really looking solid upgrade 7900 xt 7800 xt still offer great performance price come comfortable waiting potentially seeing price drop
youre right im hurry whatsoever gtx 1080 still hold well convinced wait bit longer thanks
got waiting bit could definitely save cash another upgrade gtx 1080 still solid card rush
hey thought ryzen 7 9800x3d amazing cpu might overkill depending use gaming 1440p 240hz probably wont need much power 7800x3d even ryzen 9 7900x would give killer performance without going crazy youre also planning heavy multitasking content creation streaming 9800x3d could still worth considering pure gaming overkill 1440p rtx 5080 gpu would definitely handle 1440p 240hz issue like cpu might overkill gaming resolution rtx 4070 ti rtx 4080 would give excellent performance without pushing hard price want something futureproof 4080 good gpu especially 1440p high refresh rate suggested combo cpu ryzen 7 7800x3d ryzen 9 7900x excellent gaming 1440p gpu rtx 4070 ti rtx 4080 either easily handle 1440p 240hz ram youve already got great ram 32gb 6000mhz perfect gaming multitasking
think amd gpus looking review much costeffective term performancecost rasterization feel need use rt although rt core must included game second thing futureproofing want similar situation laptop almost 7 year work great far although feel lacking aspect got x870 motherboard futureproof last thing still hesitating 9800x3d computer last many year although also thinking 9600x 2x cheaper 9800x3d
dont really look budget dont like overpay necessary know mean
youre cpu bottlenecked bottleneck calculator rubbish 40 load gpu mean couldve generated 25 time frame werent bottlenecked cpu likely cpu ram swap count towards cpu load way improve usage update cpu best case scenario 95 gpu load cpu load irrelevant cause game dont peg core time
say game requires minimum 16gb ram try closing stuff background free ram also track ram usage 90 probably ram edit actually recommended requirement still check whats usage
quick google search seems like squad 44 single core optimized game doesnt utilize 1 2 core therefore core wont utilized improve fps get faster single core cpu something like ryzen 5 5600x sure cache help case 5700x3d would way go another option would increasing setting higher gpu utilization keep way long fps high enough upgrade p mean 20 bottleneck use bottleneck calculator case useless
see certainly cpu limited without core maxing httpsyoutube6qgntlgufn0siadneoky1ortdi

cpu single core usage doesnt go 60 full game empty game though sits 90 giving 120fps shouldnt using power full game empty game
checked ram 10gb usage
already play maximum setting noticed pretty weird thing hop empty game gpu cpu usage skyrocket 90 know empty game fps lower cause nothing happening use power empty game full one checked single core full game dont go 60
noticed ram running 2133mhz instead 3600mhz docp enabled bios though problem
unfortunately 1080p monitor driver date observed another issue addressed reply comment post thought
idea
yeah hammer performance greatly running 2133
idea whats problem
really clock automatically enable oc profile bios could try updating bios newest version see work
nothing changed
im kind surprised cheaper amd card even cheaper 7600 7600xt also b580 price area
yeah im kinda surprised thing price around pretty weird area really high import price certain event really depends demand gpu example b580 priced around 389 4060 gigabyte 320 4060 actually cheaperit happens priced similarly due local market work demand gpus make price fluctuate lot one thing pay isnt always card value whats available people willing pay locally
well dang 4060 best best 4060 weird fast enough 1440p long play graphic setting becomes memorylimited quickly
yeah exactly 4060 best option ive got right 1440p know itll fine long tweak setting bit memory limitation definitely something keep mind price need best balance im expecting ultra setting every game think itll handle throw wanted take advice people plus im still upgrading part setup ill make ive got
dont need cap monitor hz match fps monitor refresh rate hz fps independent monitor 500hz youre getting 350fps monitor still display 350 frame per second wont waste extra hzit refresh often ensuring smoother visuals lower input latency fact keeping monitor maximum hz beneficial still reduce screen tearing input lag even fps doesnt fully reach refresh rate however experience screen tearing dont use adaptive sync like gsync freesync might want enable vsync cap fps slightly maximum frame rate minimize
thanks alot ur explanation

haha worry glad working

dont trust remove gpu half hour really rocket science also internal m2 pci expansion card could use would preferable compared external ssd
best option nut remove gpu get m2 nvme slot otherwise id sooner get sata ssd external one
get nvme drive never removed gpu like easiest part build
save money get nvme drive need help feel free dm
confident removing gpu try bringing cpu store install ssd
m2 cheaper faster super easy take gpu install one watch video peace mind trust
reason wouldnt work especially easy steam put new steam library make sure add storage option doesnt show steam game installed way different installs way make sure enclosure support uasp setup secondary drive external nothing would change done plug drive also full format thorough smart test update firmware applicable get drive hopefully catch issue early make sure drive running smoothly learned hard way new ssd multiple bad sector eventually causing crash corrupt data
gona blocked gpu cant put
answer
problem isnt removing gpu gpu big block adjacent pci slot cant put nvme pci 2nd slot
put gpu
put back obviously
httpsyoutubeec5gqhqbqdmsisoadmpfa0tslnqq
bro talking nvme slot already o talking pci slot nvme go blocked gpu httpswwwamazoninsabrentnvmepciealuminumecpciedpb084gdy2pwhttpswwwamazoninsabrentnvmepciealuminumecpciedpb084gdy2pw
put different slot dont slot thats mother board issue whats issue exactly
slot blocked size 4080 gpu
thats answer blocked gpu dont another slot beneath luck mobo
apc wellknown reliable brand good choice sure pc running within 500w maybe need powerfull unit like 1050va
depends much power pc whatever else want connect like monitor draw
csn go 1000w guess average didnt look much im running
ive nothing mesure sadly cant tell much pc 2 monitor consume
momemt power outage pc must within range time shutdown example chatting reddit 200w 850va enough shutdown rush
thermalright phantom spirit
whats temp saying thermally throttling compared benchmark result average target 9700x ask think cooler fine chip ryzen chip designed run hot possible pretty much time boost clock long arent actually losing lot performance high temp fine unless truly hitting like 100 really getting hot try thermalright phantom spirit frost commander believe best air tower im sure either hugely different though would also concerned cooling setup case large issue getting enough air removed case
version configuration see multiple one picture see online ram get covered fan standard pushpush configuration
adding im idiot thinking wrong noctua model yes u12s probably enough cool chip either tower mentioned better believe cutout bottom fin stack allow ram clearance well check
im hitting 85c thats limit ive set bios ive compared benchmark im average think average calculated result system may may pbo enabled im sure im comparing system setting also correct assuming cooler work harder make better use 85c getting performance
also cooling setup positive pressure dust 3 intake 120mm fan front one 140mm exhaust fan back case thermaltake view 71 tg
look like enough ram clearance theyd cover rgb ram know sound stupid paid led id like show
certain extent yes course like scale infinitely cooling put onto setting chip 85 thats already standard ryzen operating temperature could bump 90 get bit performance average feel like current cooling solution fine
going rough time finding air tower isnt going stick ram slot want upgrade cooler essentially need dual fin stack air tower physically always take space referring buy thermalright 240ml aios much air tower least u look using aio build space dont like much
im looking review tom hardware scythe mugen 6 black edition similar performance better deepcool 4 deepcool iv thermalright phantom spirit 120 doesnt cover ram slot may go even single stack opinion id also rather go aio one die wasnt good experience
yeah totally agree aio point dont like use either air tower basically run forever need replace fan point dont opinion cooler really heard good thing scythe brand recommend cooler actually seen depth benchmarking usually recommend thermalright stuff find benchmarking yt tech review website actually prof stand relation current cooler seems worth would say go make sure dimension fit case single fin stack im sure much better without ridiculously tall since air cooler generally work based much metal fin stack much air blow across metal dissipate heat much heat dissipate given amount metal hopefully make sense
read reviewhttpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentsaircoolingscythemugen6andmugen6blackeditionreview tom hardware comparison cooler deepcool assassin 4 two stack signgle fan seems perform marginally better doesnt exposed fan able see make little anxious
seems pretty viable im sure massive upgrade current cooler definitely upgrade seems like may also quieter
sure resolution set mirror well extend desktop even doesnt mater
doesnt matter pc work using old 720p tv picked thrift store 20 buy power supply second monitor quite awhile gaming friend 17in screen believe 1080p 24in monitor primary
cringe bigger one second monitor
bother see
aesthetic technical problem
wise man say kill part cringe kill part cringes
27 inch isnt good size 1080p pixel density thing generally 27 inch better suited 1440p bear mind id get 1440p 27 inch swap main monitor use 24 inch second hardware allows obviously get another 24 inch screen otherwise say fuck hook whole tv lol
hardware handle quit good thing dont want speed lot money ant monitor looking get 180hz downgrading 240hz think would quit lot
wont notice much difference 180hz 240hz maybe competitive fps title thats
think idk live country good
get 40704070super instead
mb forgot add post edited
worth valorant would almost recommend 3060
unfortunately budget since cheapest could find 595
would get 4060 see find amd gpu cuz rx 7700x similar price put better vram
3060 horrible old
thank
need new one overpriced
rx 7700xt even better 4060 ti soo try find beast excellent
see upgrade rtx xx80xx90 class card future answer get atx 30 atx 31 power supply corsair rmx seasonic focus bequiet straight power msi mpg another reputable manufacturer 750w avoid cheaper 7year warranty model like corsair rme msi mag see upgrade xx80 class card get least 850w xx90 card horizon get atx 31 single rail 1000w unit
dont see upgrading next 4 year asus prime 750w 80 gold atx 30 good perchance found cheaper price others mentioned also seen people recommend 850w 4070 super safety purpose pay extra 850w psu thanks advance
reason get 850w power supply scenario improve upgradability case even xx80 series card get power hungry future however gpu draw 225w max intel cpu draw power competition amd even maximum torture test system still 200w tolerance doesnt include tolerance manufacturer built design asus prime step term quality psus mentioned probably still fine get job done personally wouldnt try go bargain shopping power supply easily remain system 10 year without get replaced seasonic focus 650w sixth year service plan replace anytime soon whisper quiet imagine saving 20 loud fan coil whine year
good idea short time period definitely dont year lot product release price change happen year youll end buyer remorse save money instead
wary warranty period buy product year long warranty take year get rest part may playing something go wrong really dont see point buying separately youre going using anyway bother
easier return bought return store buy spread way test may part falling outside store return policy deal manufacturer bigger pain deal part working also look used prebuilts probably snag used workstation drop ssd used gpu like rx 580 setup easily done 200 let play game today lowendgaming subreddit fairly common wealth information way something working gather fund use cheap workstation temporary base buy ssd gpu want transplant custom build youre building nothing stopping selling workstation served purpose help recoup cost
component youre u amazon prime day black friday generally time good sale historical low part price youre going buy part ahead time would thing like case fan honestly like know look youre going buy specific part sale use historical pricing data like pc part picker camel camel camel even might change mind decide like new case like fan design better future
temp completely fine much better old situation old paste fully also huge deal still relatively fresh problem come old paste already dry thus creating air pocket
going single tower double tower 6 pipe good move dont know anything question expected tolerance heat hardware result compare reviewhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen77700x25html im sure given set seems entirely reasonable ask think also log usage time example im sure often need crank cinebench synthetic test real life application temperature context habit adjust
paste less week old l hope thats issue havent done anything like oc uv yet changed fan curve spin faster earlier appreciate help
oh fair enough anything temp better review dont use cinebench often wanted push limit thanks help
yeah likely issue also cinebench multicore almost cooling setup
also normal shader caching game rise temp usually reach mid high 80 barely touched 90
yeah thats normal shader compiling go 100 cpu get done fast possible comparable cinebench multicore

fractal design north well made easy build good ventilation well reviewed sought user review also good
last thing think super hard build
read motherboard manual watch least one stepbystep guide beginning end preparation take time dont freak something doesnt work immediately sure succeeed rocket science extremely careful motherboard socket insert cpu removing cover thats really one step mess stuff bending pin aside computer hardware brittle use common sense youll fine
thank much help
itll work isnt much upgrade depending live find lot rx570580s cheap locally
wouldnt risk plugging gpu generic psu get reliable 550 watt psu
want save used rx 6600 probably also check aliexpress rx 6600
every garbo psu nowdays ovp ocp fails trip ovp ocp fail motherboard protection even gpu protection budget changing psu isnt option
first glance everything look like fit though mentioned cpu cooler overpriced 6core cpu like 5600x significantly cheaper arctic freezer 36 would suffice want make sure enter individual component pcpartpicker make aware potential issue httpspcpartpickercomlist
weirdly enough built pc almost exactly like debated msi motherboard asus prime b550ma wifi ii ultimately chose asus lot people issue msi like random reboots say asus potential heat issue 5600 bing 65wt totally fine far issue
alright thank
u would build like httpspcpartpickercomlist2d3prm sama 360 lcd cpu cheaper aio display q80 overpriced would go newer b850 ice price faster rgb ram better ssd dont get crucial p3 plus good added yeston 4070ti super due cooler saving case 850w enough
sadly im u im australia pcpartpicker still work sadly yeston 4070ti super available ebay everything else get pcpartpicker
httpsaupcpartpickercomlistybnrzp ah thats bummer couldnt find except aliexpress seller look fine cost amount 4080 super worth opinion
cpuz free software display info chip actually pc easy way see actually got something counterfeit benchmarking tool look something like cinebench want look compare score number there lot tool like testing cpu
actually think youre gon na get legit cpu really cheap huh interesting test could use cinebench r23 example compare known legit result
run cinebench see stack 5700x3ds get similar single multi core score displayed correctly bios fine
super pi 7zip cpuz
generally run passmark benchmark suite anything build
3dmark demo passmark cinebench testing aside main benefit 5700x3d would require powerful gpu really work also game benefit l3 cache come raw cpu gpu performance fps end run gpu limit wont magically generate frame x3d running lower end low mid tier card wont much uplift think different story 4090 like test potential hardware part pretty much wasted dont power back would comparison 3080 depending actually playing might neither worth risk upgrade httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhd8vcmcmepahttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvhd8vcmcmepa

yeah good point 6700xt isnt exactly insane anything entirely possible want upgrade upgrading sake also 5800xt amazon like 170 close faster maybe enough matter

try lossless scaling first
think youre right go 5700x3d
may missed boat 5700x3d hard find stock anywhere
dont think need upgrade game play anything switching 5 5600 cpu
5700x3d route would go would argue tier performance 7600 7700 less expensive drop upgrade need spend go am5 dont new build would make argument even cheapest a620 board 65w tdp 7600 7700 nonx variant would way go potential future upgrade low tdp cpu reusing ddr5 another socket going low end board would make cost difference trivial thats case already am4 board
thanks wanted check get others opinion havent built pc year im quite loop new gen stuff plus main worry overlooking something others would quite obvious
hmmm country im uk pick one overclockers amazon 200 next day delivery
denmark local computer store 15 store tray version boxed
look like tape covering unused memory slot pcb dont know likely wasnt anything bad good
human assembled gpu made mistake shit happens like doctor leaving piece napkin tool inside body surgery
oh sorry forgot mention piece removed next screwdriver image covering two module ill edit post
may part packaging gpu assembled maybe heat sink paper base keep clean gpu assembly etc may also something like bit peel thermal pad apply
thats weird paper thin dont think would affect gpu temperature memory module would absolutely cooked tho
checkout price r5 5600x even r5 5600 faster gaming r7 5700 need save money also consider using stock cooler good enough always buy stronger cooler later want rx 7800 xt good card difficult recommend since rx 9070 xt right around corner bit risk card going lot better price still mystery decide wanted point rest part alright id probably recommend get motherboard least heatsinks since using low powered cpu fine anyways

work fine 5700x3d equivalent ryzen 7600

rather buying 5700 go ryzen 5 7600x
might cpu limited 4k
1440p 144hz consider cheaper card 1440p 5070ti 5070 might close 3080 worth upgrade monitor thats limiting cpu case
1440p 144hz monitor played game total war warhammer 3 battlefield 1 5 age empire 4
interesting elaborate monitor limiting
good
4080s wasis 4k card performs exceptionally well 1440pthe 5080 bound faster since 4080s already surpasses httpsyoutubefyuz1cp4rnit311144fps many game 1440p 5080 even game making poor value choice
really technically efficient game wont utilize core cpu usually used heavy workstation server plus single core clock speed lower normal gaming cpu get normal cpu youre gon na game
absolutely worth worksisnt scam
sound like great deal make sure proper psu required high end 6000 card draw lot power know amd recommends least 850w psu 6900 xt maybe someone used weigh
hope seller genuine provide testing warranty im kinda secure anything go wrong
shouldnt warranty dead 4080 want upgrade disappointment shitwreck 50 series real option provides actual improvement 5090
5080 would perfect also info 7800x3d still 2nd best gaming cpu world
1yr old 4080s died either warranty claim something wrong pc done something covered warranty 50xx gpu work build 50 series pcie gen5 believe b650 asus strix model motherboard gen4 x16 slot unlike strix f e model b650e gen5 x16 slot whilst 50 series work gen4 dont know performance might affect edit suggests negligible effect httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscalinghttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscaling 5090 massive 575w wont due psu wattage probably enough 50xx gpu model would replace 4080s 3rd party tested benchmarkings arent released yet jan 30 likely 4080s lie 5080 5070ti 5080 rumored something like 15 take relative pricing
real question die worried want actually go 4070ti super readily available
would 100 get 5080 money going slightly better support future tech might well grab 4080s cost
4080 sad decision 5080 way cheaper dont make mistake ofc
warranty dont gpu stock anymore theyll return money need buy new one month price 4080s rose 1520
5080 better 4080 super sure similar price care someone consider disappointment
warranty claim ill get money back point need decide whether stick 40xx buy 50xx since coming thanks pcie info thing like exactly im sure whether get 50xx idea get 5080 pcie gen 4 work work full potential even worse 4080s
warranty claim dont technical detail store couldnt repair return money guess unlucky defective gpu
yeah 47 wouldnt call improvement fair
added link negligible performance difference pcie come price want pay 4080s quite cheaper moment compared release 5080 may vary country seems 3rd party seller likely mark upwards poorly 5080 msrp exaggerating price difference wait day see benchmark decide think price difference worth 5080 performance increase sure 5070ti considering release long may wait likely performantly less close 4080s guess part though price probably less similar current 4080s price
gpu there really good reason pas free performance
price would definitely call improvement especially dont gpu otherwise worth upgrade maybe
thank helpful
well look like difference 40 50 5090 negligible isnt even worth mentioning
there thing free performance nvidia already pulling low quantity gpus available launch bullshit there chance therell enough stock online store prevent scalping actual price closer 15001700 usd rather msrp
literally explain would buy 1200 dollar 4080s could buy better performing 5080 price scalping stupid argument plenty store said 5080 good supply price new 4080s
find 5080 price yes might well go however highly doubt 5080 cost
dont need next step would ddr5 6000mhz would require new motherboard would worth upgrading cpu well
maxxing ram
task manager generally accurate account every process system 3rd party apps may hook everything want know accurately go task manager cpu graph right click select change graph logical processor
yes task manager reliable cpu gpu much except temp running 1060 6gb 100 according nvidia software task manager said max 30 mostly gaming stayed around 15 usage incorrect far cpu usage go pretty reliable
ok game take 50 cpu usage even though already graphic card im referring wuthering wave 1080p
graphic card got cpu provide everything gpu render frame higher frame rate higher cpu load illustrated every cpu gaming review ever made
mean even though gpu 90 active game still requires cpu looking benchmark article youtube i5 12400f work 2030 high setting aaa game tried game
gpu isnt 99 pegged time cpu holding back game youre playing period end discussion isnt always possible achieve people within budget plenty game fastest cpu planet cant max nature game work

yes
pcpartpicker wattage x13 good rule thumb fine
use pcpartpicker website help solve
yes plenty good unless youre something ab normal like running dozen old hdd odd etc
yeah calculated amount wattage use thats mean come like 476w people still saying risk wan na know sure wont mess setup
alright thank running 2 ssds 1 hdd shouldnt problem
yes enough thinking buying something reason change otherwise super solid
aight appreciate
lower fan rpm bios whatever feel acceptable
performance wise standard phantom spirit faster evo look better
phanteks say case support 360 radiator sitting top case case id change cooler 360 aio sitting top case thermalright make excellent value option look benefit cooling set fan quiet speed youll still cool cpu perfectly swap fan around rest case arctic p12s p14s significantly upgraded cooling case cheap
thats somthing need sort im case came fan hub 3 pin one full need change
look thing thought better fan somthing dont care look since window side desk
consider would make case fan exhaust worry would getting cool air gpu bit worried pumping much heat case rtx 3080 thats part weird setup year back case basically everything else different take side case summer overheating put 3 exhaust top used 120mm aio keep heat away gpu fix issue might relevant current build though
360 radiator would set exhausting air like current fan set rear fan exhaust put 2x120 fan front intake remove drive cage youre using setup plenty cooling want even cooling gpu space pci slot even 3d print something like httpscults3dcomdemodell3dgadget5slot80mmfanmountforpcpcislotcovershttpscults3dcomdemodell3dgadget5slot80mmfanmountforpcpcislotcovers httpswwwprintablescommodel6571314pcislot80mmfanhttpswwwprintablescommodel6571314pcislot80mmfan httpswwwprintablescommodel965999pcislotfanmount92mmfansupporthttpswwwprintablescommodel965999pcislotfanmount92mmfansupport use low rpm fan bring fresh air directly gpu
might worth shot using drive cage cant remove though reason use 120 fan intake front instead 140
intake air 2 fan v 1 fan
yeah support 2 x 140mm fan 200mm thats moment swapped 2 x 140 2 x 120
ah bad misread spec sheet lol quick mental math tell isnt much airflow difference 1 x 200mm fan v 2 x 140mm fan eyeballing picture case look like 2 x 140mm fan utilize space better less restriction case design provide static pressure overall 200mm fan also tend poor static pressure isnt great considering drive cage way
well yes enough wouldnt recommend especially bronze rating efficient
itll run back probably green screen load know get 1000 watt psu rig
wattage wise yes quality wise sure depends unit id looking upgrade higher quality necessarily higher wattage psu unless plan getting 90 series card future
1000w psu total overkill system less 400w power consumption full load lmao
like 500w 4080s us around 300w max 9800x3d use 150w multithreaded work load still stuff using bit power
overkill good
system requires roughly 430w full load r7 5700x3d msi b550m pro vdh mobo 32 gb ddr4 ram fractal design lumen s36 v2 aio 6 argb fan aliexpress 2tb wd pcie 40 ssd 6950 xt nitro jonsbo d31 mesh screen case dedicated 8 lcd screen expect 4080s run bit efficient 6950 xt op probably gon na powering separate screen psu
power usage value used got techpowerups review 9800x3d 4080s founder edition
yes monitor connected wall outlet say 750w enough dont money upgrade psu without downgrading important stuff
could go slight undervolt make sure anyways undervolt ftw
thats big f
dont need force anything bios pcie standard backwards compatible put gen3 nvme ssd gen5 slot itll run gen3 speed ill honest wont notice difference gen4 gen5 normal use ssd gpu loss going gen5 gen4 5090 basically negligible within margin error kinda bandwidth speed wont fully utilized long yet ssd unless youre routinely working large file time gen5 speed felt edit read 40 riser 50 slot issue sound similar going 3040 transition id wait 50 riser come shouldnt issue problem happens slot 50 riser isnt guess forcing slot 40 mode would avoid issue yes dont think bios setting let specific downgrade one slot 40 itd global probably wont know sure check setting though
saw perfomance go lower 12 blue screen smth httpsyoutubeisfbwjltdr8si4bplr8tu28d7bzwk
gaming see advantage using gen 50 drive sata ssd unless gen 50 nvme good deal go gen 40 instead
going notice difference jayztwocents gamers nexus debauer also think paul hardware etc etc came conclusion difference gpu performance gen3 gen5 anywhere 15 anything youd actually ever notice unless time energy individually test compare result jtcs channel even made mistake regarding controlling ambient temp show graph showing 5090 getting marginally better performance gen4 v gen5 due temp variance literally nothing worry
cool thanks solution likely forcing gen 4 wait gen 5 riser revert default gen 5 new riser cable
honestly current riser separate purchase would insert gpu normally switch get gen5 included case disregard lol
personal suggestion would go ryzen 5 5700x3d motherboard support would add best used graphic card find mentioned 7600xt germany go 350 money could find 3070ti 3080 would much much powerful 3080 might pushing 650w though sure
u get 5700x3d think equivalent 7600 u dont spend money whole new motherboard ram u also upgrade 32gb ram along gpu upgrade
3070 ti 3080 available used market new piece available
guy surprised know cost india 20k inr thats reason creating lot confusion
yeah know suggestion would buy used card long test seller computer little risk course choice new id also check 4060ti
cpu cost id say since already am4 getting 5700x3d cheaper option bc 7600 requires new mobo ddr5 ram 5700x3d doesnt come cooler getting one cheaper like 250usd am5 upgrade

cheaper cooler cheaper equally good ram get rid dxpensive fan easily save 200 dollar

need get x3d cpu since need cache specific game 7800x3d 9800x3d isnt 9800x3d good pick long run aircooler would u recomend well yes use gtx 1070 could wait 5070ti better
yeah lian li case fan combo neat thats good chunk money wasted fan probably get three pack arctic corsair rgb fan price one infinity aio arctic half price id rather spend little extra motherboard maybe power supply op want future proof bit
really plenty youtube video testing want know
game requires x3d cpu doesnt exist yes might better performance regular cpu also strong besides guess either 1440p 4k screen considering getting 4070ti super higher go resolution smaller stress put onto cpu gaming 5070 probably wont better 4070ti super thank nvidia 5000 series dlls4 multi frame generation could useful play aaa game speaking air cooler one great price httpspcpartpickercomproducthyxrsythermalrightpeerlessassassin120se6617cfmcpucoolerpa120sed3httpspcpartpickercomproducthyxrsythermalrightpeerlessassassin120se6617cfmcpucoolerpa120sed3

severely bottlenecked
combination gon na work yes i7 7700k 6700xt3060ti bad idea yes simple get performance 6700xt3060ti
itll work 4 core cpu par even today 1080p standard i5 12400f 6 core decent budget option consider make 6700xt3060ti
work yes amazing sort last afford cpu upgrade though
10700 i7 okay 8c16t cpu aim higher currently though 9700x amazing much 1 low rose
thats fine though wouldnt go much higher gpu wise 4c8t really start hold back gpu horsepower
ive 3060 4770k ran fine ran 1080p tested eldenring fs2020 ymmv bit two game bottleneck close cpu 80 cpu ran hot stock cooler fine since 7700k isnt much faster 4770k back day competition intel imho 3060ti bit much 3060 would fine depending game
ocd 7700k 6600xt often undervoltunder clock save powerkeep gpu cool since 6600xt little 7700k really take advantage 1440p even delidconductonaut50ghz 280mm aio
upgrade amd cpu itll pretty poorly right good amd build kick shit intel cpu price lower power consumption also consider b580 intel actually better 3060tislower 4fps average better vram way cheaper 3060ti ok secondhand never buy thing msrp
got i7 7700k 3070 rtx work fine game run fine sure cpu bottleneck doesnt matter generation game still suggest buy new computer im summer
love everyone similar upgrade go 6700k 7700k 7700x saw night day difference regardless gpu said gtx1080 felt dead water 7700x black magic upgrade
im currently rocking 6700k 2080 super ive overclocked 6700k 47 ghz im still bottlenecking gpu im seeing much stutter running well enough ill building new machine soon could consider oc
question yes sensible fps limit alleviate bottleneck issue moderately situation issue frametimes collapsing looking busy scene still occur occasionally overclock 7700k still felt responsive 14600k app using e core due adding ton latency
probably going lock 30fps newer game tbh gf 6700k 48ghz
8700k get 60fps pretty much every game
target fine know reason
decent sized bottleneck would put money towards new computer youre ready
bruh everyone really underestimating 7700k lol
i7 7700 rx6800 perfect borderland 3 stalker 2 cpu 100 gpu 5070 poste time 19201200 dont understand need cpu 3 bot screen quite smooth open world dev really dont take care optimisation nowdays
itll okayish pretty mid would go rtx 4060 minimum day

think 8c8t enough today
dang man perfect post didnt know needed ive 9700k2800 feeling strain feel computer slowdown didnt know would upgrade first luckily psu case case fan storage air cooler good found nice bundle b6507700ddr4 ram obviously im waiting assume need upgrade gpu maybe ill rebuild try 2080 new platform
2 extra core lot heavy lifting modern game though
old bottleneck crap 3060ti

new gpus launch wont available month due scalper nice thing though new gpus launching see bunch people sell 4000 series nvidia gpus 7000 series gpus like bunch idiot cheap due fomo might able swing good bargain card soonish resolution playing game edit good tariff wont affect affect u though u haha
say last year
say im new pc gaming havent even played game yet pc pretty decent monitor 4k 144hz sure 28 ryzen 5 7600x cpu ill likely pair 7800xt heard pretty good combo 1440p resolution stuff new ive always console worry abt sort stuff monitor aoc gaming monitor
previous occasion new gpu release covid want grab crystal ball instead
youd like dont know gpus drop mate forte never involved gaming pc
cpu 5700x3d gpu wait new generation amdnvidia bad thing gpu hitting 100 gaming fact indicates gpu fully utilized mean youre getting performance 2080s still pretty solid card wait new gpus get released
upgrade cpu tho gaming sometimes get graphical problem fps drop thought id need upgrade thank
upgrade cpu tho dont need 5700x3d last longer wont bottleneck cpu demanding game graphical problem fps drop mean artifacting probably mean gpu dying faulty however fps drop different matter reinstalling driver using ddu checking component resolve issue likely mean gpu faulty
alrighty thanks
reseat ram
update post think found problem two pin h610 bent vcc pin vss linked together chance least one cpu survived
try turning freesyncgsync doesnt work likely monitor faulty
dual channel 2x16 faster single channel 1x32 ram slot typically numbered 0 1 2 3 4 dimm slot motherboard want run 2 stick 4 slot board would place slot 0 2 slot 1 3 placing 0 1 2 3 placing wrong spot dual channel ram motherboard user manual info interested
able use slot 1 3 continue using 2x 16gb set technically could issue ram overclock difference really extreme overclocking world record speed
okay one slot isnt working leaving 3 others running 1 stick 3 slot 2 still capable enabling dual channel dont want single stick use case dual channel ram give performance v single im confused youre asking even problem based youve written
one stick two stick ddr5 behave since single stick run dual channel basically less ram running 1x 16gb stick instead two
op talking ddr5 single stick dual channel two stick give two dual channel stick wont get bandwidth increase two stick ddr5 like ddr4 quad channel exist workstation cpu make use
xmp disabled automatically pc noticed wasnt running two stick removed battery reseated meaning reset bios setting slot 1 3 refuse make pc boot mobo relies slot 2 4 want boot function properly
first build pc put ram first third slot made pc want boot reason try run first third slot see boot let know went edit nope seems like mobo relies channel 2 4 want two stick ram
im thinking buying cheap mobo handle component sending one claim see store tell issue otherwise ill say fuck go single 32gigs thanks answer
didnt say said slot 4 wasnt working anyone supposed know first put part together issue didnt say case dont one faulty slot one working one newly purchased motherboard still warranty get replaced
didnt say thought wasnt issue normal thing motherboards want run two ram huh guess learn something new everyday thanks
sure
yes
imgur link dont work
im weird issue imgur also view post reuploaded imgbb
fit fine case like 28l massive sffpc world reference roughly 3 time volume ghost s1 matx itx lot space play
originally going use 25 ssd ill use 2 lexar m2 ssds one o one program game input always welcome
holy shit ghost s1 compact boy im brightest come part think significant bottleneck one part im thinking upgrading ram future 3200mhz
think lot tech manufactured vietnam especially oem part intel also make cpu doesnt mean bad quality id really return faulty try see work ok
point cant recommend thermaltake power supply advising brand avoided completely power supply least far heard anything bad corsair rmx 2024 model several example 2021 model remarkably well setup punching well expectation seasonic also sell pretty consistently good power supply
lot stuff get made vietnam dont think big deal give peace mind return

everything look great there ton room saving since white build would go thermalright frozen prism aio 56 compared 80 peerless assassin also white aio rgb would also go wd sn850x sure sale canada right sale america 14999 save 20 storage gain dram maybe go gigabyte b850 aorus elite wifi7 ice instead x870 ice version dont really need extra m2 slot mobo post code would save 50 maybe go something like antec c5 argb 109 right would save 40 case another dual chamberfish tank type case
httpsitpcpartpickercomlistsbyf4p get cheaper efficient 7600 cheaper cooling solution 7600 65w cpu affordable motherboard ram 2tb storage instead 1tb bit slower noticeable though 4070ti super instead cheaper case better psu price performance
thanks reply got point question mobo wifi since difficult connect ethernet cable dont care 2tb storage always put future need would get 2tb slower faster 1tb upgrade future air cooler enough clearence ram air cooler mind switch aio space clearence ram price 4070 ti super justify performance didnt see quite increase fps game increase price could wrong though thanks
1 yep wifi bluetooth 2 would still take 2tb version 3 yep enough clearance pcp cant check every motherboard every cooler remark always pop 4 yep definitely especially extra vram newer game thank paying nearly 800 12gb vram much would take 4070ti super 100150 day week
thanks ill look
whichever case like better quite literally decision make

none build suck trash mobo aio waste money ur budget ram relatively slow get 6000mhz cl30 amd expo lian li a3 owner im biased saw review thermalright psus would avoid gigabyte psu even tho one ok instead httpsukpcpartpickercomlistdmrjjnhttpsukpcpartpickercomlistdmrjjn better mobo allow u upgrade cpu fututre faster ram cpu u around 5fps less u save money u using stock cooler cpu run noticeable less hot sfx psu mandatory price nice better u picked storage
rx 550 4gb version
yep low profile one
rx 550 additional 2gb really help fyi rx 550 gt 1030 basically performance constrained vram
except gt 1030 2 gb think safe 200 watt power supply saw spec sheet suggested psu 250 watt im sure still power
200 watt power supply like low profile one see oem pc like dell
rest system look like edit yes i3 8100 isnt power hungry undervolt gpu want safe saw people i5 8500 180w psu run rx 550 problem
pcie slot compatible
also get ram 216gb decent ram would ideal cant get additional 8gb stick also window 10 going reaching eol end lf probably able get decent value used cpu upgrade
dont know check motherboard manual web
oki saw pcie x16 slot gpu compatible right
gpu 6 pin 8 pin power connector
low profile dont think 6 pin 8 pin power connector
1 thanks contributionit helpful newbie around
great tip remember push way harder thought would get screw
httpsdepcpartpickercomlistg7h6sh would get ryzen 5600 rx 7800xt 630 amazon germany bit cheaper buying somewhere finland httpsfipcpartpickercomlistg7h6sh
hello welcome easiest common upgrade case upgrade cpu ryzen 5 5700x3d significant boost computer secondly 1070ti reaching endoflife expensive replace gpu price gone crazy sticking nvidia youd want upgrade least rtx 3070 4070 4070s expensive would personally recommend avoiding 4060tier gpus wish switch amd find good value rx 7700 rx 7800 level switch nvidia amd youll need run piece software called ddu flush nvidia driver stay behind cause problem amd video card vice versa switching amd nvidia ram easily upgraded later 32gb thats priority nice point first priority completed storage youre running near full ssds effect performance clear space deleting old gamesfiles buy 2nd ssd install space
there route go one want stay motherboard get either 55005600 new 5700x3d new aliexpress make sure reputable seller lot review also doesnt include cooler fyi upgrade gpu used radeon rx 67006750 xt 12gb vram 7800xt want 16gb vram could try nvidias gpus youll spending price per performance likewise ram decent long speed good maybe buy another 16gb little safer though entirely necessary depending configuration ie 1 stick 16gb 2 stick 8gb go whats already dont mix definitely upgrade storage 100gb barely anything one two price per gb crazy go standard ssd nvme m2 ssd slot go one though run hot could either buy heatsink theyre cheap check motherboard already heatsink use stickerlabel heatsink optimal worst lastly big one psu maybe importantleast thought component build settle whatever look review one seems good already great still research putting anything dont want fried make sure total wattage rest component also expensive doesnt equal best 80 rating misleading sometimes isnt scare inform
thank nationality obvious xd
thank much input
thank detailed answer ill start look processor aliexpress also bad making post 1t ssd idk would write 100gt
nope checked account immediately saw finland post
video editing normally want powerful cpu id suggest getting i7 i9 youre going keep motherboard think highest upgrade without swapping motherboards would i911900k motherboard psu
600w psi asus h510 prime
want look upgrading psu get newer powerful gpu asus h510 work easily intel 11th gen i7 i9 processor upgrading i3 i7 i9 almost certainly need better cpu cooler system came i7s i9s run hot
seems like either little nudge austerity measure latter much less fun isnt something like 3x gdp owed id careful calling something like unnecessary lest necessary necessitates need since gaming talking could always sell mobo go am5 less power draw similar better performance cheaper
feel like im minority opinion group buying second hand anything except psus really havent worried much market saturated lot 23 generation old gpus specifically ludicrously low price still deliver wonderful raw performance 10801440 even thing dire due tariff dont see used market getting crazy least pay play give peace mind money well spent
dont think intel exception end raw stuff chip come elsewhere added cost land consumer pray us extra money something benefit people know thats gon na go
decent rig wouldnt think much would enjoy game mistake would bought version 4060 ti 8gb vram
criticism adventure game repertoire includes da veilguard tbh rest post seems sensible
reluctantly splurged im currently 6 beer deep
enjoyed origin much havent gotten game yet whats big knock
played three game one origin definitely best two great compared one absolute masterpiece short writing character dogwater general combat boring puzzle braindead disclaimer didnt play veilguard watched quite bit gameplay
yeah passed last one watching gameplay thankfully read veilguard storyline based wanted give shot
jup would another option would 5700x3d aliexpress bit cheaper
resolution play cpu gpu bound gpu utilization percentage game
put one aorus b650 thing need done bios update ensure compatibility also using 3 m2 drive gpu x16 lane aorus b650 pro ax
nope edit ill expand wont issue b650e board thing youll miss v x870 usb4 port
board come intel i225v nic notorious piece shit ever exist finding b650ee came instantly decided
thank much help
see thank much
weird overclocking rma
see power plug motherboard isnt loose top cpu try one stick time ram recent one ram one particular slot causing cpu light different motherboard
definitely possible 7950x3d lost whole as ccd died completely later took board
cpu issue new computer year began overheating shutting around 90 degree celsius turn cheaped aio replaced stock one better one sitting cool 56 degree maybe cooling issue
nope havent overclocked yeah im probably going rma
360mm aio temp good dont think cooling issue
definitely sound defective hopefully accept without question shipping quick
mean cpu way powerful gpu typically people spend like 13 budget gpu budget list random part playing triple game trying
7900 xt fine 650 7900 xtx 830 also fine though better pricetoperformance 4070 ti super currently overpriced 5070 ti better may good availability launch would save money ssd though get kingston kc3000 2tb 120 still considered highend gen 4 drive
look good overall personally would go performance orientated build like httpspcpartpickercomlistf8ztpj cpu better priceperformance cooler newer cheaper x870 motherboard less lane ssds still enough 34 ssds cheaper ram better price performance ssd 7900xtx sapphire pulse sale newegg cheaper case pre installed fan better airflow psu overall 100 buck cheaper fps
resolution plan gaming game play budget
1440p2160p max setting 60120 frame game 9800x3d gpu selected perform 120 fps max 2160p also dislike nvidia amd gpu really option unless find 4080 ti super deluxe omega whatever like 750 cpu future proof amd drop better gpu could march know
also triple becoming lost term recent year main game see monster hunter wild stalker 2 re4 remake space engineer 2 maybe splash ark survival ascended also play alot early access title unoptimized mess
agree also looking msi 2tb ssd decent speed 109 atm already 1tb samsung 990 gon na move new build
also opinion beware brand relevant gpu manufacturer
appreciate time ill buying everything microcenter long stock component appreciate alternate option
1440p minimum max setting aiming 60120fps 2k monitor assuming thats 2160 unless 4k sure difference play everything honestly atm pubg playing monster hunter wild stalker 2 re4 remake space engineer 2 budget 225k usd max aiming rgb obviously got glass side panel see bit bob thing
personally would go 4080 7900 xtx bang buck 4k gaming 9700x find cheaper reason liking nvidia besides liking pick whats best need price performance
go budget left incase gpu expensive msrp also might require 31 fan splitter cable 9800x3d rtx 5080httpspcpartpickercomlistxmdgzp
yeah thinking7900xtx get good price worst case go 7900xt hold put better amd gpu release later line regard nvidia fan tech dont care ray tracing personally ill save versus bandwagoning xx90 series 2k every year lol also old school maybe way id rather raw vram versus flashy ai stuff might embrace eventually ill keep trying resist
im pro amd generally seems 7900xtx aim ill compare note change thank much second opinion
mean people im pretty sure included 3080ti dont use rtx one buying new graphic card every year dont know stable 7900xt want would check video test game ran youtube
easy enough ive included sapphire nitro within budget rgb tax one best 7900xtx variant market cheaper option available well addition ive changed ram gskill variant used benchmarkers 9800x3d 7900xtxhttpspcpartpickercomlistgx8gzp
yeah idk exact apecs maybe video description 7900xt max setting run game 120 fps 1440p less demanding 4k like re4 remake coupled 9800x3d im praying bomb sale drop 7900xtx sale still valid stock plan purchasing everything approx 2 week
dont upgrade 7700 unless get one like 20 worth invest much pc id trying find used 1070 2060 super 2070 etc
personal opinion think building new pc would move start scratch could say afford
get rx 580 50 buck start saving new pc
maybe get used rx580 1070 short term start saving
imagine 1060 3gb us 6 pin right id suggest getting used 6600 least itll bump modern gaming cheapest gpu option want build new computer future youll already half decent gpu
save new pc i7 7700 last week big bottleneck pretty much every modern game wan na stay budget build something like ryzen 7600x9600x rx 7700xt
imo dont upgrade build wasting money part wont give good performance save money build whole new pc
build new pc
curious gpu died sort game u running
cpu really holding back 4c4t low boost clock find 77007700k cheap would pretty substantial upgrade adding hyperthreading nearly 50 core clock platform dated however newer cpu much potent used platform upgrade could also help lot intel 1200 amd am4 i5 12400 r5 3600 minimum 16gb ram used rx 6600 would also provide great value huge performance uplift
would better building new pc point friend
rip
honestly id ask question low end gaming sub guy smart come older hardware tell go part interact
everyone isnt necessarily wrong new build obviously thats going take alot money im assuming youre looking idea i7 7700 3060s dont want new build personally id say buy best gpu get bottleneck blown proportion wont damage part still get great performance bottleneck rocking i76700k 3080 knew needed new build found awesome deal 3080 month later wife bought house pushed back new build played cyberpunk phantom liberty 1440p 60fps using dlss wasnt ideal complaint buy make sense know could get good gpu new build going take get gpu build later feel wasteful buy 3060 match buy new gpu new build within year 3060 money couldve easily went whatever new gpu
id buy whatever graphic card power supply wantcan afford rock youre ready cpurammobo upgrade use gpu later
yes woukd local tested 150 bad 1440p stupid setting vram make viable
am4 lga1700 pretty accessible offer cpu night day performance compared skylake am5 also worth youre willing stretch budget bit went gtx 1060 3gb radeon rx 6700xt two year ago night day cpu i5 12600k reference
get used 3060 12gb call day buy new pc afford cpu bad itll run year
i56500 gtx 970 upgraded 3060 ti good due cpu bottleneck build new pc
nothing less 5090 9800x3d
everybody nothing get something like 2060207030503060 get back playing save newer motherboardramcpu even used 7700 60 isnt bad upgrade long youre playing could past improvement
ive got evga 1080ti ftw3 want buy dm mail
dont forget pour one long serving 1060 warrior
case
much would i7 6700 compared 7700 usually 7700k expensive best cpu platform slightly higher clocked 6700
buy something like rx5700 xt 100bucks start saving new rig good enough 1080p gaming
save money switch am4 used ryzen5 3600 used rx 6600 thats best thing doif cant absolutely need pc get rx 6600 later upgrade whole thing am4
new motherboard ryzen
think depends playing said type usage valorant 3060 cause bottleneck compared 1060
pc still good keep use 3rd gen i5 way better would buy gpu use future pc well rx 6600 something similar find one 200
id get used 1080 ti beyond 1060 run modern game even 4k assuming turn noncritical setting texture quality detail important keep 1080p breeze new 4080 super give better picture quality turn setting honesty 1080ti good enough long turn shadow lightning hdr rtx available think thing look fancy forget soon starting playing without
intel b580 am5 platform
hate say would looking new pc 6th gen maybe putting 1080gtx would give bit life low cost anything seems like overkill
depending budget either 1 buy new powerful gpu 2 buy decently powerful one layer pc upgrade 3 build new system pick choice
get gpu want future build bottleneck isnt problem gon na run 50 still better old 1060 make sure psu power run look build want make new system youve got time get money research etc build already got gpu
get 3060 even 6700xt
one pc last rouhgly 57 year generation
5700xt 100150
time 1080 tij
replace motherboard am5 motherboard buy 7800x3d 4060 youre budget 4070 super midrange youll set next 810 year maybe even youre content
bios mod allows skylake mobos compatible coffelake 8th gen
get 1660 ti 7700 actually need power build new pc one museum piece cuz old computer still cool
wouldnt bother cpu upgrade cost much little performance gain cheap gpu replacement keep system running offering bit performance boost way go opinion would go rx 6600 cheapest viable somewhat modern option rtx 3050 garbage expensive card would somewhat waste money considering rest hardware used rx 6600 would probably even better new one sold mine last year 130 reference pay
5090
3060ti quite bit better similar used price find
used 2060super least run new game coming require rt mesh shaders save new pc
build new pc upgrade better card hit bottleneck unless upgrade mobo cpu time youre halfway new pc cost youre gon na spending fair sum either way get decent spec anything last 35 year consider cost cost performance isnt gon na great may aswell everything new build maximize performance cost ratio
would revamping try get cheaper side am5 chip ddr5 looking 3060tis 3080s midlevel build wont entirely break bank
suggest keep using dy honestly
get amd 7500f 140 b650 mobo 100 16gb ddr5 6000 50 1tb nvme 60 soooo much faster everything pick gpu 1080 4070 work perfectly
seeing comment indicate building new pc way go would agree particularly since youll void upgrading newer operating system especially use window since officially unsupported october 2025 however understanding budgeting nature concern recommendation 1080p gaming would get newest 8gb larger gpu afford anything far back gtx 1070 even rx 590 though newer would better various reason consider upgrading cpu since already one work newest gpu afford give future proof get new motherboard ram processor newer generation able reuse hard drive case possibly psu however newer equipment may also require upgrade well youre still using mechanical drive instance newer ssds blow water typically update computer equipment phase gpu usually standalone upgrade motherboard processor ram utilizing existing ssds computer case power supply unless something else required beyond get newer generation motherboard launch also potentially get later generation cpu incremental upgrade road consideration frankly post reddit think sound approach budget conscious pc upgrade
get 4060 much 3060 less power equally fast newer tech await downvotes
possibility low budget near future dont want partial upgrade get used older gpu good 1080p performance 8gb vram try target rtx 2000 like around 20602070 rtx 3000 like 3060 amd 5700xt 6700 6750gre low budget upgrade cpumbram near future mean accept effective bottleneck monthyear focus good midrange gpu try go 8gb future proofing since could also begin target 1440p try target rtx 3060 12gb rtx 3080 4070 rx 6700xt 6750xt full new pc though might keep element like case power supply good enough storage disk full new pc near future try get cheap decent used gpu like gtx 1070 ti rx 580 maybe even 1060 6gb wouldnt go bellow 6gb swap dead 10603gb note first two option last one especially firstlaste one try avoid gpu pcie40 x8 bus like rx6600 6650xt 7600and xt rtx 3050 4060and ti since old motherboard thus might end bottleneck pcie bandwith note 2 also take note current psu capability watt power cable
need whole new pc
put ever gpu want system go get b580 6750xt hell 4090 might little lopsided still run pump good looking graphic
1080 1080ti get get get
2nd either upgrade used part cheap invest new pc afford
dont completely start scratch tbf use old case psu ram wanted move am4 lga 1200 build
yep agree machine doesnt support win11 due incompatible cpu youll likely run performance compatibility issue current build updating cpu others said doesnt need cutting edge could opt am4 build eg ryzen 5800x3d 5600 budget b550 board way keep everything else current build gpu id recommend waiting 50 series launch price older card stable anything going better 3gb 1060 youre looking quality budget id recommend waiting rx9070 pricing strong find amd gpus better value stay relevant longer want nvidia specific feature 4060 good option
wasnt issue newer amd card older cpusmotherboard something older pcie version rebar
last month ive basically played helldivers 2 rainbow 6 siege halo dont couple hour per day play game free used play lot war thunder modern warfare 2019 bf1 bf5 battlefront 2 vr stuff like boneworks h3vr
thats happening time soon sadly budget pc emergenciesupgrades 300350 tought i73060 combo
yeah thats good sum post
thanks
yeah forgot mention im able spend lot money pc right anytime soon budget 350 thats thinking i7 3060 combo thanks advice
actually replaced psu 4 year ago one exploding corsair one started issue 850w 80gold think able withstand every gpu budget think going gpu might smart move thanks lot
ill probably get 3060 keep update rest year
ill get black drunk honor
corsair carbide spec01 bad
3060 12gb gon na run 300 new6700xt bit cheaper think 250 used market dont afraid buy usedjust pay attention user rating check past sell kid using refurbished am4 board bought amazonits going strong 5years think nowand currently handling 5800x3d 7800xt fine afford right usedthen thats way would go
grabbed girl 6700k instead 7700 34 year ago still hold pretty well paired old 5700xt upgraded rx580the sucker overclocked 48ghz easily tested
tought honestly im scared getting used gpu even kinda old used gpu
joke almost boat guy budget stuck ended new board paired 7600x 32gb ram 1tb ssd 1080ti pleased
id like im scared buying used gpu 1080 kinda old chance getting non working card higher
sadly thats budget
yessir
left less vram gave upvote counter one downvote
sadly thats gon na happen time soon
maybe ill get 3060 rx6600 stick afford better cpumobo
id like im scared buying used gpu 1080 kinda old chance getting non working card higher
thats true unless account potential need psu power case enough airflow depends op actually want use pc though game play
pc outdated would use component new build old case safe use course ram probably 8gb ddr3 might 16 would bottleneck new system psu old actually get dangerous especially since cant deal m power draw spike current gpus
sure ram would work getting new cardmobocpu really wanting plug 8 year old psu even powerful enough
honestly am4 build arent much cheaper really save ram assuming youre buying new part used youre right hunt ebayfbm
ive heard intel card amd issue newer amd card doubt 6600 fall
rebar supported ryzen 3000 something older stay away intel gpus
bottleneck mean get full performance part used huge one due 2 core cpu one bad made stuff unplayable anyway absolute worst case youll get performance basically impossible much likely get fairly decent performance bump 3060 6600 dont go 3050 even old 1070ti faster 5700xt yeah dont worry bottleneck get decent lowend gpu evaluate gain also look youtube content combination stuff hard find httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvsimqd5fb0t335s 6600 7600 30602070 would pick edit clear get gpu first test performance buy cpu required
problem 7700k officially run window 10 support run october run window 11 think tinkering keep mind go route need still may want save new budget pc
buy used rx68007700xt new rx6750xt
probably could get 3050 6gb say bad might work
yeah would check see 350 would get im america dont clue pricing like think worth looking cheap cpu upgrade may impact gpu afford
think thats solid plan
card mentioned fit fineit check ok pc part picker id messure current card double check spec one looking found picture case one im seeing dont much clearance past slot panel second note3060 able utilize dlss4 soon
theyre easy delid hit 5ghz semi decent bin
well ive bought new 4080 super instead used 4090 reason reliable seller maybe friend could option p ive checked lineup 3060 want 4080 super guess 12gb important newer chip avoid 8gb version
3070 although idk get reasonable price today lot people upgrading rig new 5000 series card id keep eye second hand card put sale coming week
yr 3060 12gb according reddit 4060 still better
yeah buy cheaped used part get functioning cheapest option xbox series meantime
exactly need suffer wait afford better system might well get good graphic
upgraded psu 34 year ago 850w 80 gold one exploding corsair one started acting sketchy immediately replaced ram 16gb ddr4 think least two salvageable fact im gon na able throw lot money pc time soon tought upgrading even small bit gpu cpu maybe also m2 replace western digital hard disk ive rocking since 2017 would seal deal couple year
absolutely psus much work fine dont typically
actually replaced psu 34 year ago 850w 80 gold one exploding corsair one started acting sketchy immediately replaced
already run win11 pc maybe ill get decent card within budget wait money upgrade rest
3060 12gb 300 amazon
according reddit researching upgrading kid pc depends playing game need vram 3060 would edge dont need 4060 better choice
oh god youre running o hard drive first thing go said hard drive ssd would massive upgrade even sata ssd
technical knowledge something ive done thats brought point would get 7700k 5060 dollar second hand market oc pair 3060 12gb wont perfect combo really cash limited go route enjoy game save next year two something new 7700k least give lot headroom 6400 used labtop version cpu last year 1060 mobile handled game fine optimized setting desktop version processor much powerful laptop variant think going route definitely give competent computer game make sure tweak thing get much possible 7700k
used 3060 would save near 100 3060 12gb used used 1 year use bit 1 year work good problem even maybe used 4060 last longer want new gpu anyway httpswwwgputrackereuhttpswwwgputrackereu show 300 buy 4060 instead 3060 better
nono o ssd
game also need ssd day newer game actually require
buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead amd cpu dont work well faster ram
get ram speed 6000 good
also check ca latency make sure 30 good build youre wasting money think know already
alright yep know expensive build dont need much power lol wanted check good build thank reply appreciate

750w depends cpu enough run 360w rtx 5080 5080 likely come adapter included need get new psu unless really want
adapter work like specific plug psu meant existing one 3080 using perhaps gon na cause issue pulling power plug supposed never designed

1 something nowadays included dont use adapter 2 adapter thing get criticized 12vhpwr plug thing rated 600w exactly 600w normal pci 8pin cable rated 150w cable overspeced real wattage cable safely deliver around 215260w depends quality 4 cable deliver 860w1040w safely thats one really understood new plug worse old method especially consider heat cant distributed well accumulates one plug instead 4 even 3 would better 1 12vhpwr plug
look board chipset fit budget
given z390 several generation old point buy dependent find z390 board would work fine also idea using electrically conductive thermal paste 2025 aware doesnt actually provide benefit
want game dev going create game finish school
get laptop wait till finish college get good job get pc sound like plan
could get cheap laptop note etc decent desktop
since youre college laptop would work best opinion since take anywhere beefy laptop recommend httpswwweluktronicscomhydroc164090ultraprohttpswwweluktronicscomhydroc164090ultrapro one httpswwwbhphotovideocomcproduct1846218regmsivector16hxa14vig693us16vector16hxhtmlhttpswwwbhphotovideocomcproduct1846218regmsivector16hxa14vig693us16vector16hxhtml since already nice monitor budget less enough link ive sent thats well
lowmid range gaming laptop college rarely time play also terrible battery better heavy shit carry around regarding game development youre school computer lab available would good deal thats engineering
id say laptop pretty powerful use spare monitor second screen maybe look used refurbished get power budget
could get good desktop good battery life fast laptop
maybe cheap light laptop good battery college carrying 25kg laptop 2 hour battery gaming laptop around college isnt great maybe cheap desktop home stretch dont need good pc learn gamedev lot thing learn long 3d render upgrade get
check something like cromebook used macbook work notetaking stuff like build pc 1500
look resource available college many cheap access software like office adobe product school also practically giving away cloud credit see one there opportunity heavy lifting compilerender using cloud service rather rely beefy hardware locally
put laptop backpack use anywhere trick isnt possible pc get pc rent room apartament job
building new am4 box going upgradable
might get httpscapcpartpickercomlistbryf4p little gpuheavy rx 7700 xt worth opinion wont need upgrade soon game run much better am5 platform course 5700 youd picked actually slower 5600 game got ta careful misleading cpu name anyway problem ryzen 5 7600 use stock cpu cooler change later loud planned monitor keyboard mouse speaker etc wired internet need wifi
httpscapcpartpickercomlistdvb974 newer am5 platform better ssd case included fan 50 buck cheaper dont get b580 older platform perform better faster cpu
id probably go am5 ryzen 5 7600
never worry much psu telling tomfuckery coming pike require 200 watt upgrade
instead cooler master cpu cooler maybe go thermalright phantom spirit peerless asssassin great budget cooler
im idiot didnt realize hit end development life
everyone else telling use am5 board ill make sure switch monitor im still searching mouse keyboard im using trash setup connect laptop likely gon na need wifi
might yoink thank build list
plan monitor keep within total budget wifi version motherboard add dollar

happy gaming
120mm 140mm fan provide cooling difference speed 140mm fan provide cooling lower speed also mean lower noise asking almost negligible difference concerned noise 140mm may better case support
depends case mount 140mm fan without extra obstruction however lot case rail fan mounting block 2030 airflow add turbulence 120mm actually perform better hopefully obvious running 6 fan purely cosmetic wouldnt recommend dropping 100 fan unless every component top line
got thank
im getting hs40 red devil 7800xt 7900x3d case support 11 fan overkill
rip hold fan
looking scuf make envision controller seem high quality lot people complain software havent bought one yet
ive eyeing gamesir tarantula pro layout tmr joystick quality seems iffy according review
every game engine different care ram speed others much going 3200 3600 maybe 1 difference cpu cpu run ram 3600
worth
r7 5700g probably much general curious learn information performance increase simulation game like city skyline 2 particular run unity
even went higher speed ddr5 ram mean something else isnt worth
replacing 5700g better cpu dedicated gpu lot better upgrading ram
ddr5 youd also upgrade cpu motherboard
dedicated gpu 7800xt cpu gift slight upgrade last thats im using cpu recommendation cpu heavy game
ye heard
5700x3d
definitely change cpu 5700x3d thinking ram much faster gaming 5700g
5700x3d pick one aliexpress stock dry look like starting used 5800x3d option
1000w recommended 5090 ok amount 80
bare minimum 650 watt according calculator used recommended card 850 watt 1000w plenty
seems like good plan
spec released 5090s honestly im following news cant imagine computer ever needing entire kilowatt power run thats crazy talk
would least go 850 watt calculator never account spike decide hook controller charger hub usb use rgb controller controller number minute detail add 50 75 watt quickly
first 750w psu fine 5080 mean thing supposed get efficient age psu scare lol like say repair shop itll work doesnt
ill using 850w 5080 9800x3d build im planning
dont rule corsair see 5080 cpu wont pull 550w add 100w part youre still comfortably within range im working number 360w 5080 162w 9800x3d happy corrected theyre wrong
nvidia recommending 850w using 9950x cpu stock take 7080w stock 9800x3d likelihood 750w fine setup review guess 1000w side overkill
im planing use corsair rmx 750 5080 7800x3d
psu calc say 750 fine nvidia recommends 850 9950x3d 170w
get atx30 31 compliant one old one trigger overcurrent voltage protection shut randomly happens seasonic 850w 1000w psus iirc tester tested 5090 5080 would draw like 900w peak power consumption definitely get one newer standard
1000w plenty shouldnt need 1200w
gpu alone us 575w
thank definitely go 1000w think like future proofing really want atx 31 pci 50 ready
im running triple fan aio 9 fan im loading havn case
thank input old psu however really old corsair cx750m 80 bronze semimodular ive read 9800x3d also utilize cpu pin slot order operate full speedcapacity old psu one 4 pin definitely upgrade
850w probably thats needed
nope solid 1000 watt unit plenty
know running obserd amount stuff wouldt asking
quiet light speed 120mm pwm high speed fan apparently draw 54w 12 would draw max 65w youre going need fan real issue generally people dont run fan 100 speed rule thumb generally would say 100w youll draw noncpu gpu component hard find actual amount part youve got lot id mindful around running many fan one header thatd easiest one overload 12 system fan
yeah worth upgrade based info actual wattage
well sold ps5 ive never built pc clue wattage psu everything
ok thank
water cooling first build
yet pretty specific fan
im sure bought lian li aio 360mm im lian li fan 9800x3d 5080 im tryna build something good dont upgrade year want nice
well thats many bought
aio watercooling like splurge fan thats okay bit surprised first build everyones budget different
point know buying lot fan know need modernhigh powered psu difference someone want upgrade old 1080 build 5080 someone thats trolling
build watch use aio triple fan setup cooling gpu figured norm way im early 30 probably different budget build teenager younger adult
big psu get still havent answered question lol im serious im first time pc builder dont want get something thats gon na mess
sorry didnt notice askedyou didnt modern 800w psu would leave worry case question age psu im sure 750w fine 5080 paper
thanks
new cpu 5700x3d cooler thermalright phantom spirit ram either get 2 ram stick ram get 32gb 3200 cl16 32gb 3600 cl1618 300 whatever gpu afford new rx 9070xt march might interesting 500600 guess
want upgrade modern pc would kinda smash everything could upgrade cpu 5700x3d upgrade ram 32gb upgrade gpu whatever afford 7700xt 7800xt pretty reasonable value 4070ti super market good come nvidia goodness said would say best bet upgrade cpuram wait march 90709070xt launch gpu upgrade even though gpu weakest link moment modern game 6gb vram 2025 pretty rough dont think need start scratch considering already moboetc arguably even ram upgrade nice required token though insane start scratch afford term pure moneyspent v performance gained id stick current platform
could make build last another year pretty easily here id update motherboard bios get 5700x3d 5800x3d used brand new doesnt matter much get kit 32 gb 3600 mhz cl16 ram lot people selling old ddr4 kit cheap get better graphic card option id looking used part 6800 xt 4070 4070 super 4070 ti 3080 new could wait 5070 rumored price believed plan playing game raytracing enabled id lean towards nvidia rather amd last step sell unused part make money back done think youd pretty capable system hand least another year option course replace everything
thank suggestion im happy know still get good value motherboard yeah desperately need vram recently ive turning everything possible go 6 launching indiana jones first time pc flat told
thanks advice live canada might go used gpu rather new depending new price look like

alright found board support cpu box gigabyte b450m k
data recovery firm might able get data back cost thousand dollar much worth
file really important id look professional data recovery service theyre worth price could try using recovery software like disk drill
depends much prepared spend
used
deleted
10 gb vram cant even 1440p could go used 7900 xt used 4070 ti
get used 4070 ti used 7900 gre instead
gpu used everything else bnew
ai response
checked cad application use work best amd intel
ive read theyre good cad work
youll fine careful plugging thing back motherboard
doesnt really matter much grand scheme thing go without
ok leave
dont buy hyper 212 cooler look thermalright phantom spirit 120 instead
brand new 4060 horrible deal try find used 3060 ti faster much cheaper
httpspcpartpickercomlistkdjvdj want best gaming performance money would build like get ryzen 7500f aliexpress 140 one seller 2k sale get 7600 non x 7500f perform identical better priceperformance cooler newer am5 board cheaper price performance ram 1tb ssd though 35 buck could get ud90 2tb kingspec xg7000 rx7900xt nearly 3x good rasterization performance 2x vram capacity like brainer decent matx case great psu money pc give great performance fullhd qhd 4k
appreciate head ive trying research throw together part others prebuilts commonly use super knowledgeable else available
thanks reply dont ton intense gaming itd likely used rts game like red dragon civ would nice able run gta5 cod need arise
mean gta 6 right yea definitely pc able play game want 12k pc monster gpu ram sale motherboard 10 buck coupon everything else priced normally
doesnt matter either order
doesnt really matter would update bios first already installation usb set dont another one install window first bios update
updating bios always good idea run newest bios system moment
updating bios first save time sometimes window recognizes mobo new hardware bios update make wait
triple check know install new bios feel uncomfortable installing new bios without window window first
fine download bios update usb window installation
ask ai
apparently amd gpu doesnt good support ai program take account

5700x3d
r5 3600 already 4 cpu
think worth upgrade get x3d either 5700x3d 5800x3d
definitely would worth time put 5800xt coming 5700x unless youre expecting minimal difference would save little throw 5700x3d solid upgrade thats worth time wife enjoy 5700x solid cpu well sure 5800xt good option would
price 5700x3d high am5 cpu performs well am5 cpu 5800xt 5800x think boost clock 100mhz higher thats worth hassle would grab 5700x3d remember x3d cache doesnt apply every game game improve drastically game wont
seems like thats best chip am4 5900x need extra performance productivity theyre price range right
yeah seems like difference would less ten percent bump performance adding heat
yeah thats noticed im guessing would gain probably less 10 performance adding extra heat deal could find better price 5700x3d would absolutely jump right one ive seen used one going least 250 buck thanks info
basically ya crazy much hotter 5800x 5800xt run used 5800x 5800x3d run cooler brother 5700x run cool ya price 5800xt great cpu would send extra 5700x3d youll notice big difference game large cache either way youll happy think going 5700x3d smarter move
difference 5800x 5800xt 1 look 5800x 5700x comparison enable pbo set limit 5800x 200mhz curve optimizer one try something 10 25 work
thanks advice look like ill waiting better deal x3d cant find one soon ill wait save am5 platform better longevity
oh wow sound like there much point think got unlucky silicon mine though cant get reach 46 boost without running issue boost 45 still run well hot considering upgrading wife 5600 5700x since theyre also sale 140 buck saw 5800xt sparked curiosity try upgrade pc even marginal difference long price good
np good choice youll happy forsure patience virtue enjoy pull trigger
well ill damned happened another quick search google 5700x3d see came across deal might missed sudden stumbled across combo deal cpu 280mm ekwb elite drgb aio 240 free shipping good deal
ended going kept looking online store cpu cheaper could find brand new one 350 used one 250 im even thinking selling aio come getting beefy air cooler instead since im sure thermalright assassin king 5 heat pipe enough cool anyways thanks input helping decide
sound like good deal
really dedicated gpu significantly better igpu
setup solid entrylevel midrange gaming youre looking play demanding game want better setting think adding dedicated gpu like rx 6750 xt rtx 3060 line itll really boost gaming experience
try looking 7500f aliexpress maybe spend much mobo butnit doesnt really matter
seems like solid pick likely want maybe youd better trying 2nd hand gpu thsts bit better though
nah 900 6600 build
im clued amd system understand am5 give room growth future still supported right build eye seems logical dont think youve overdone one area come cost make sure gpu isnt massive balancing thing maybe someone give variety card look alternative long doesnt blow budget additional fan good idea air flow always nice
focusing cpu ram motherboard right upgrading gpu later good plan rx 6600 run modded fallout nv skyrim fine might hard time newer game like rdr2 cyberpunk high setting youre ready upgrading better gpu like rx 6700 xt rtx 3060 really boost performance tougher game overall plan look great build solid base upgrade gpu later keep system date next year
buy lianli lancool 207 6 forget extra fan big upgrade nothing id buy biggest silicon power teamgroup nvme 3040 drive could afford ill leave gpu expert
motherboard recommend dont really understand make one better another picked one review

country buying part whats budget
latam around 1100 amazon part usually get use provider local price absurdly increased
think youre better saving money wait rtx 5070 available since rtx 4060 ti variant poor value money longer production girlfriend cant afford wait rtx 5070 getting used nvidia graphic card viable option
4090 production month supply dried 5090 release friday supply also expected extremely tight
get amd cpu
switch b760 motherboard b850 going use amd cpu dont need highend motherboard may also consider b660 b650 get better psu one listed tier ehttpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist personally ill get air cooler like thermalright peerless assassin use remaining budget extra storage extra ram
fine
yes fit
httpspcpartpickercomlistpt8btm 897 7600 7700xt system caveat custom cooler stock fine always get custom one later 100 sure psu havent seen review sure whats going case 26
decent since building new would try stretch budget build am5
honestly get pretty great system 900 easily 1440p gaming ultra setting httpspcpartpickercomlistbgdhrv
dont cheap shit psu
talked friend highly doubt need upgrade time soon kind game would running thanks advice
look pretty good tomorrow ill check everything see
make thing difficult check gigabyte qualified memory support list httpswwwgigabytecommotherboardb650eagleaxsupportsupportdl frozen old memory conundrum tried resetting bios original setting clrcmos manual give info need get back original setting give shot
yeah double checked ram bought supported resetting pc able load window troubleshoot system restore led bsod inaccessible drive full window reinstall
wise men build motherboard box bare minimum part first make sure thing work gpu one stick ram drive make sure board post ok would suggest go sleep come back later youre less frustrated need strip part see work nothing cpu stick ram add thing back one time onboard graphic use dont bother cable management jazz youre sure working
one find easier build pc nowadays compared 90
check asus manual usb slot use automatically flash bios usb stick
honestly dont agree building pc day info online ridiculously plug play easy follow logical sequence sorry youre struggling youll get sooner think itll worth
test gpu one stick ram drive plugged fan extra go use hdmi instead displayport mobo hdmi sort new vga always try work used mobo restart cmos battery mobo might still atrocious oc setting last user asus intel pretty spiky combination last gen imo
think statisfaction building everything personal specific need using skill really get one enjoy process nerve racking tedious full issue built upgraded like 5 pc part everything worked every time felt scary
someone many night fixing hardware also worked server hungry stressedfrustrated exhausted eat rest take look next morning emergency believe thing look much better also make sure space clean tidy extremely messy working stuff leave equipment place good keep positive attitude brother
bro know basically rant reply looking didnt research intel cpu discounted dont sell cable managed even checked component work didnt update bios troubleshooting step yet say since 90 skill issue
get older want shit work even mean paying relate also post sound like skill issue pc never easier build honestly
amazon ive always done trick ordering another cpumobo im serious issue feigned compatibility return cost additionally found really rough situation like plugging cpu 8pin upside frying port turning pc nothing let tell pulling hair ive elected take small mom pop tech shop able fix mobo like 30 case happened overlook something small theyre great catching time wont pay arm leg
right recently hadnt actually built pc 10 year last one good id update gpu christmas year built daughter one built new one rebuilt old one living room medium machine daughter build went swimmingly thought shit come build would power fan spin video output building cautiously well essential component far fortunately id day come across post httpsoldredditcomrbuildapccomments1hflgycafteryearsofbuildingandrepairingpcsfor guy put together ridiculously good trouble shooting flow chart looked id never even heard train ram issue fired took long walk im sure long actually took train ram good
building 25 year gotten easier time little quirky issue frustrating though hopefully get rest come back fresh
built pc 90 irqs dmas pain thought year wanted new pc realized worth anymore one reason decided build year also lot cost saving amazon listing worried fakesscamsshipping issue happening one part return window etc tried build local purchase best buy walmart etc way expensive great prebuilt found
take break would try get latest bios board flash cpu pcie power cable 24 pin power cable connected motherboard add latest bios revision downloaded manufacturer power motherboard flash newest bios hope really help know frustrating system bootup
extra percentage cost order 100 working box warranty one vendor easily worth adult time equal money friend
feel ya started building 90 man agree much fun back awesome current build two year old still rocking good pieced together new pc great part gifted mostly 10th gen i5 16gb ram going plex server small minor intermittent problem deal biggie still wasnt thrilled told people there nothing wrong buying prebuilt youre paying little extra supposed zero issue understand pc build subreddit still continue building main rig age 30 year building get exactly youre coming

kinda feel tbh im 37 20 year built many pc family friend client quick buck even tho never job nowadays even changing cpu cooler meant removing motherboard case etc feel like huge hassle instead something fun exciting tech week ago forgot plug rgb mobo im like yeah ok ill next time need clean maybe dont get started hiding cable dont patience 20 even 10 year ago
30 year builder holy shit couldve written last build wife similar situation also needed bios update thankfully backed everything lost everything new build needed gpt nvme formatted mbr soooo mad swore came across deal like fuck im going upgrade first build decade went flawlessly im move everything bequiet lightbase 900 badass go sideways litmus test even enjoy hobby anymore say younger maybe applies lot u older builder far far time adult impatience seems monkey got back mid late 30 think lot u know first rodeo almost always issue build difference took lot stride younger person felt like nothing time many many sunrise later seriously dont time bullshit issue popping clearly yet obviously professional maybe get challenged much every single day adult world building challenge start feeling like totally unnecessary
dont let people talk shit youre done youre done honestly make life easier instead fretting take pc shop good review tell told u fix yeah money sound like point life time important like said dont enjoy building anymore
im around age dont know age definitely dont enjoy much used really value stability

problem turn short cooler using damndest thing ate way time care admit
recent upgrade got ryzen 9 9900x thought consistently updating bios turn another tabgigabyte update bios control center wasted 5 hour checked bios realized one year ago slapped old processor ran update perfection feel man
recently built pc gf similar build similar issue turn installed aio cooler wrong much pressure enough atleast thats guy store said fixed like 15 min suggest looking
man guy specialized pc shop sort thing drop shop tell component want list component case collect couple day later theyve updated driver bios ran stress test ensure everything work also come one year warranty anything break ill send computer back theyll sort sure ill end paying 50100 sure beat wasting time like op trying figure thing shit hit fan
sound like motherboard thats purely last weekend recently upgraded build wouldnt boot though manage get boot twice different stick ram different ram slot one slot luckily small pc shop nearby cheap b550m board picked day night testing everything swapping old part least remembered put old cpu download flash new board bios would accept new cpu
oh god anxiety skyrocketing half built pc sitting kitchen counter speak im complete gut rebuild going intel amd new gpu etc stop tonight gpu come tomorrow already preflashed bios adding anything hopefully work
hey know frustrating think scenario buy pre built computer something go wrong need ship service center fixed wont know good job get back 2 week later life pre build friend live every manufacturer like many still operate way
plug video output mobo instead gpu see get display work get everything installed try getting gpu working prob would need enable gpu bios disable integrated graphic likely defaulting integrated
apparently ive living rock seen previous issue old microcode earlier 1314th gen processor one easier one miss pc got better recently got finicky precision needed make part ill still build ill cadence keeping old pc running build new one mobocpuramcasepsu upgrade
feel completely understand used always older pc played old game mess around linux got job sysadmin kind got fed bought imac year later started missing pc gaming sold imac built first real pc yeah dont enjoy anymore thats ok
old faithful bios speaker bring every build well decade nothing quite like post beep
ive hell recently sata cable machine wont boot hang black screen reseat sata cable cable working year problem
starting reading soon read i7 14th z790 realized probably flash bios indeed
new mobo right many come integrated graphic turned without detecting cpu support might good trying plug monitor mobos hdmi port first new mobos dont even beep unless there issue could explain still didnt work two known working gpus
thnx telling u
say boot pc 1 ram stick happened 2 ram stick didnt booted 2
kinda suck
sorry dont want unsolicited advice first action figuring mobo communicates error code beep led mentioned didnt hearsee either every mobo indication either success failure
efibios 100 need updated
psu didnt enough power somehow everything way harder bios update fix micro code update mean bios update psu supplying enough power seems thing since athlon overall post sound like diary entry
cool story bro youve building pc 3 decade cant figure simple bios flash something doesnt add
wasnt easier past id say opposite there much information available thats changed although doesnt help google becoming useless
thing small fragile plug got great deal clearance prebuilt year ago ill probably never build
thought friend mine co yesterday literally told couldnt bothered went whatever available store build similar spec mentioned hey dont enjoy dont enjoy point stressing time would definitely better spent case see ritual need every couple year ive done 20 year far feel really good finishing build spend 24 day building time hand hurt like hell co im diy person usually teething issue usb driver interacting random new technology idea beforehand never issue like mentioned tho maybe ill also grow hate eventually like think obsessive research pragmatic decision making help avoid scenario though likely matter chance though know
would spend time buildingupdating software enjoying game film etc could addicting
used work one big uk pc retailer ran pc laptop build area must built 1000 desktop laptop server etc time course always hit build pc friend family time liked didnt want get scammed overbuy year ago needed new gaming rig felt like shouldnt built picked part reputable builder put together even went bit overboard rgb first time usually always breeze block desk point glass side light cost top part charged paid gladly bang job love shame letting someone else putting foot
im others think easiest simplest ever learn build pc regard fed wanting troubleshoot totally fucking get job decade dont care home find reputable computer shop near still build mine troubleshoot everything look okay ive spent several hour already pay 30 local guy take look saved twice recent year well saved bit dramatic nothing wouldnt ever figured didnt care bring work home speak
tldr op went intel regret yes intel cpu mobo really bad never issue building pc family member friend went amd even bought really old amd mobos like 450 first bios version box ryzen ready never updated plugged new gen cpu still work never crashed
sound like plugin cpu power cable old generation cpu dedicated cpu power
hdmi motherboard lol
wild ran exactly thing building pc girlfriend plugged seems working boot fan spinning light ez debug led working nope video go google search problem say faulty ram buy 2 set brand new ram luck say power issue try 2 different psu 700w 800w luck ive decided buy another gpu mobo cpu test also went whole bios update nonsense good luck build anyway
get frustration really prebuilt often better youre swapping frustration troubleshooting frustration shitty part support
everything running try waiting turning wait 15 min memory finish training first boot nothing showing monitor everything worked flawlessly
think like diy stuff used yard work painting installing appliance small electrical plumbing job im retired minor electrical work pay professional rest
building pc information available youtube website much easier used
happens frustrated happens build dont work also happens someone doesnt find fun worth hassle really liked firmware modding mobile phone installing firmware unlocking bootloaders taking cheap phone installing awesome rom etcetcbut want phone work matter price higher time spent isnt worth amount money presume something boung happen sooner later unless really made life suggestion really logic one wouldnt go hour cable management checking build work
im last person want listen given ive completed precisely one 1 pc build issue cpu ram led error light flashing gpu powering assembled everything wound taking apart every piece piece piece testing individually try figure went wrong even took cpu basically went back square zero check pin alright got frustrated wasting night diligently following instruction manual online video took 30 minute walk cool popped open chatgpt voice feature literally described precisely done going told update bios exact motherboard worked instantly rest rebuild breeze say take breath step away try use resource available troubleshoot return
understand frustration forgetting thing form past setting cpu speed jumper irqs zero standardization expansion card comically bad cpu cooler massive ide cable nonmodular gpus razor sharp case internals nightmare io others said build outside box get post put case
recently built new pc 10 year definitely wasnt used ram training taking long nowadays confusing wait actual minute powering system would actually post show bios sure waited long enough ram finish op also changed gpu older one initially troubleshoot introduced new problem kind legacy gpu mode gve activated meant reset bios manually time switching wouldnt use correct mode gpu
one would think youve ensured cable connected assuming part goodconnected properly boot since doesnt something wrong maybe overlooked cable maybe something isnt seeded way maybe crimped wire dohavent noticed frustrating dealt frustration weekend building second pc son birthday gift went turn nothing motherboard light boot realized front panel audio cable came undone somehow corrected issue boot fuck realized another cable jimmied lose time cpu 8pin gesh like issue boot starting feeling bad excited something wrong took sip blantons came back thought let check wire pulled wire deck found found front panel power cable like miss plugged ya know bama turned wiped sweat away turned back boot drive smooth install didnt even need install driver update asrock really surprised like many said sometimes walking away bit sleeping definitely help relieve stress frustration almost last plug worked would next step
building really fun also nice bring everything good shop spend 150 usd everything perfectly installed cable perfectly managed
k7 athlon dropped take back oc intel celeron 400 save pentium iii cost getting old buddy like longer fun long might suggest amd system get back athlon root
similar issue similar part z790 board 14700k also got blank screen random led error mobo apparently board needed bios update support 14th gen cpu flashed board bios update using qflash went right bios next boot tried video easily searchable show need thumb drive
suck love building troubleshooting pc wish got often honestly could make living building pc people would havent anything work except occasional missed plug friend tried upgrade pc heck time wont post think doa cpu also wont troubleshoot phone dont know done everything would im said tried put cpu multiple orientation got slot replied marking show orientation smh offered take component troubleshoot free hasnt wanted basically gave list thing check said good luck
op unplug monitor plug back try different monitor ive screwy monitor issue mske think pc issue
hear ya im traumatized last build took 3 weekend total 6 trip microcenter 2 hour way went 2 different brand ram 3 motherboards 2 cpu fuck ton gas say glad microcenters return policy good im new fan
dumb try single stick ram built pc scratch mobo mobo wouldnt run ram 4th slot run 1st third slot
im right went day discovered missed atx cable motherboard top felt silly also frustrated check youve got plug connected least get older time poor shit longer fun mean dont time important thing need barely get hour game week id rather troubleshooting issue linux like theory amount time need use troubleshooting unraid server put using main pc
eh im boat built machine last 20 year finally got fed entire new build wouldnt post faulty part fight get refund week bought prebuilt part died wiped sent back got entire new pc week felt good fr worth fighting amazon whatever mega company return refund
there like 200 difference buying prebuilt building prebuilts come warranty comprehensive prebuilt worth money want convenience
sound like need watch tutorial build pc rather think know sound like skill issue
suggestion might already somewhere comment try hdmi motherboard bios wouldnt automatically use gpu manually change needed hook monitor integrated graphic first
whole thing sound like skill issue
ive tried prebuilts buildtoorder kid alternative discovered sometimes worse disassemble rebuild someone elses work thing like didnt cablemanage properly cable running nonsensical route forgot plug usbc cable header buried ziptied cable bundle instead fan directing air wrong way used builtin case fan instead one ordered replace aio radiator wrong location checking one system correcting work take longer would test component build plus often dont include fastener manual cable etc id ordered part
expect thing work im happy tbh havent many issue build though usually take 115 day get build completely together beefy one enjoyable thing love helping friend make feel pretty cool lol
join crowd buddy
get roped friend enough wanted new one paid microcenter saved enough money promo deal new store deal still came happy
put together first build past weekweekend nervewracking similar ish issue everything booted display took forever first time dont know im figured specific ram wasnt compatible specific mobo seems simple hindsight god freaking trying figure lol also qflashed updated bios maybe issue regarding display kinda fun im sure want keep either future probably still
always ram slot
bought 5700x3d flashed bios b450 tomahawk installed replace 2700 nothing entire friday night wasted trying component checking put back together put 2700 back booted problem sent cpu back amazon presumed doa asked pc builder build 9800x3d system age cant bothered hassle anymore
late party old psu bought last year got 10yr warranty 11 year ago 14700k beast time 750w psu isnt weak agree everyone saying need tear see get post cpu ram use onboard video let anything going videowise clear yes pull chassis use mobo box base said earlier response 14 gen intel build z790 asus board went swimmingly like completed first build 90 well disagree one thing building gotten much easier year tjmo course
best platform am4 read whole others including am5 issue long boot expansive mb ram hot cpu marginal gain
could motherboard need bios update know amd motherboards need bios update use 9000 series even theyre new theyll say 7000 series manufacture dont update im sure intel never used intel
do window 98ntme era thats real pain resided least everything cake walk cant speak development side end user operatortechnician lot tool disposal decide go back
sympathetic run issue however read listened simple upgrade simple upgrade like swapping gpu faster ram entire build granted using previously used component like gpu psu new case new mobo new cpu new ram sure cooler newthis new build new build really better assuming take day many thing go wrong many thing interaction problem many opportunity single faulty component brick entire system going idea allot whole day take time test component outside caseit may save time save frustration think people assembling new build new build would best 5050 chance posting first try chucked case know would lose mind pulling apart dont fit nice neat easily manual suggest guessing op frustrated doesnt really someone else build maintenance passion faint heart many people may disagree user know would suggest going pc builder service cant really recommend prebuilts gamingget ps5 dont care machine dont want deal headache get something thats way cheaper new pc build work
people enjoy building computer boggle mind ive since child dad mainly watching im 36 dont think ive ever seen build work bat hell got son first pc xmas course built made unwrap part took week get thing running small caveat amd ive never built amd anything b650s mobos little quirky buy prebuilt literally never cross mind
prebuilt doesnt boot warranty throw
sound like didnt research buying part arrogantly jammed case assuming would work youre pc expert building pc since 90 blah blah ive seen whole post reek arrogance fault im smart couldnt possibly say building pc easier ever amount information utterly comprehensive question could possibly answered google search community people determined make sure make best decision never ever seen hobby community less gatekeeperish one easier computer would build think need take deep breath accept dont know everything reread beginner guide building computer try
welcome getting old brother im take id rather spend bit extra money put risk something working company plenty local place offer prebuilts part want reasonable price tend let heavy lifting
feel man built 7800 x3d unholy bitch may last well
ive building amount time least tell remembered put back plate place everything else last year new build pity forgot mounting back plate cpu cooler 90 anymore dont worry cutting hand piece shitty mild steel case bleeding new core2duo cpu
man going gf knowing knowleadgeable failing front know wont look way bring sometimes future
way literally take apart friend computer basic state diagnosis would easier begin two piece advice would like add 1 use 2 stick matched ram one stick motherboard manual specially said run board single stick ram ive never seen apparently thing 2 bios reset jumper friend
nah like gamble chuck everything together pray work
might add buy pc tweeter speaker dirt cheap give bebug beep even build pc 10 year interval little device save many many troubleshooting hour
way
yep sleeping problem help much remember first build didnt turn frustrated didnt work bed reach dreamland hit never checked psu power switch bam turned psu worked went back sleep sort rest morning psu actually ended dying next day anyway lol
going pleasant make people feel good ill tactful think necessary say loud op didnt learn much 25 year like said best practice check mb post assembly isnt obscure knowledge advice get passed around lot age lot people buy part online stuff get damaged nobody want waste time undoing cable management disassembly top rma process pcbuilding equivalent wearing seatbelt year finally getting accident im sympathetic ops frustration also think important use let new builder know keep bringing extra step
always watercool hate tearing thing apart liquid flowing one stick ram fucked build booted stick wouldnt recognize ram slot yes checked pin heatsink clamping force
saved back working computer tech parted rig customer like 2500 time foresight turn board doa annoying wait week get new board knowing dead started assembly saved day basically
get hug receive
way dont put effort getting everything perfect find there issue ill boot fucker sitting cardboard box came everything good ill add gpu thats good stuff last ill actually install case
since 486dx day sometimes need take break come back fresh outlook
time doa part always pregame box even o installed updated everything get put place case
kid idea easy get day
much easier dont know last time manually install driver initial setup definitely dont miss juggle dozen floppy install o set jumper right hard drive get recognized point almost everything plugandplay fuss
got pcem set computer s3 trio 3dfx voodoo awe32 gravis ultrasound 1632 mb ram hell yeah build virtual tandy 1000 freaking packard bell mean dont really need packard bell specifically hey fun see logo mean creative lab driver 20 kilobyte ram mean need memory free do game need punch hard drive parameter manually bios doesnt cant auto detect hell landing zone screwed enable lba mean want slave drive oh use one hard drive image another machine screw parameter data get screwed pcemspecific probably happened real hardware mean game play better sound blaster pro 10 sound blaster 16 ill use pentium 1233 mmx pretty good hell game almost uncontrollable let see work well 486 window 98 installed kick as install driver please insert window disc install driver please insert window disc install driver please insert window disc im going make window 98 cd hard drive image next time permanently mounted damn also window disc prompt happened actual hardware holy crap dosbox blessing work work often motherboard autodetect tend work pretty well
90 easier could see
second time many week ive heard statement ive shocked time computer day dead simple build havent thought irq dma channel 20 year think last time used jumper reset bios 10 year ago last used molex 5 year ago hell dont even really expansion card anymore even usb audio header standardised hard drive dont even need cable
ahh remember set dma irq dipswitches gdammed modem oh remember dealing people bought computer knew nothing hhave brother deliberately chose take computing paper law degree thays nerd oh man dealing issue bought po beige pc home however agree op quality control much better shape pc component today
nope agree orderebay computer part get sent home remember saving waiting local computer show get part 90 xd part pretty much plug play driversfirmwarebios need online easy installupgrade
hell lot less blood involved thats sure lot case sharp back
way easier nowadays
mention window taking hour minute
started 30 year ago build pc lot harder back newbie need one youtube video maybe google search back didnt even internet figure one kid build rc car record time probably advantage
yea man step step instruction video m2 ssd fully modular psu incredible cable management golden era offense op literally first thing people tell new builder buyer beware asus motherboards also 14 gen intel
till go wrong headache remember watching youtube video trying understand quirk getting mobo case bought also learnt read manual motherboard learn difference using slot 13 24
cant blame op last time understood everything nothing inserted properly lmao took age see even power cable detached
ive built 3 personal gaming rig 20 work related stuff thought good ran major issue last build super frustrating window installed even played game enabled xmp profile computer shit bed every fix tried made problem worse bricked couldnt even post 3 day headache including new cpu ram concluded motherboard died packed returned everything current rig build nzxt also able make upgrade since 100 build fee well worth cash plus cable management 10x better anything would done
happy cake day ig
arent setting dip switch jumper like old day everything built motherboard dont need multiple expansion card optical drive longer thing even storage moved little stick slot motherboard motherboards toolless retention mechanism honestly sound like case lost interest used super involved stuff like well day prefer stuff worksno tearing computer apart every week tinker something new likely causing hour troubleshooting process hate say thats part getting old
deleted
asus intel pretty spiky combination last gen imo definitely combo would never different reason glad know dodget bullet p
yet say since 90 fair also done since 90 since build seem last pretty well ive done 4 time every time new one like starting scratch
lol psi homie said git gud
could easily offer advice without huge asshole
mean want use cdrom sound card time cool got irqs sorted oh tough shit 640kb memory best start checking hi mem setting configsys autoexecbat sucker
actually found prebuilt less individual part thats great reference future there easy way avoid scam issue amazon make sure say shipped sold amazoncom youll good even something wrong send wrong broken whatever part theyll take responsibility scam really happen third party vendor scam shut shop amazon cant anything case except refund youll run less issue better support product sold shipped officially
currently working resurrecting old celeron system window run fine need window 31 system dumb promise matter trying get cope even small ssd fun forgotten disk size issue oh course pile old ide drive work could use one 2025 spare ssds spare ide sata converter tried boot ubuntu see would see drive fine memory apparently 128mb isnt enough hah im enjoying humbled way fun solving problem working modern stuff
14700k hit 530 watt full cpu load insane
2nd obviously know youre dont want sink time ive also building long time recently helped sister built part list bought everything local micro center build went fine would get random blue screen 20 minute use trouble shot day many step ended bringing micro center paid work bad cpu ready next day dont spare part lying around test every component fine paying headache
probably shouldve waited little longer amd system thing called memory training happens first boot might take outside look like something wrong
live place build computer would trust low wage worker chain shop arent paid enough care went buy used oled one shop saw manager drag microfiber cloth small stick screen ended scratching monitor shit right front feel bad op ive built probably built close 20 computer friend family never taken hour half build boot thing thats ever taken long time figure window bug
nature thanks
im 52 build always work first time hit bat sometimes make
wait whats quirky b650 board gon na build first am5 soon super budget build kid im going microatx msi pro b650mp
dont think ive ever seen build work bat flex 30 year putting together pc ive never one work first go counting basic stuff like forgetting plug power cable maybe old irq dma day cursing id say last 1015 year basically like clicking together lego im putting together new pc wife tomorrow im probably jinxing old phenom ii x4 955 still remember putting together 16 year ago sadly getting frequent bsods im retiring old girl still find relaxing im looking forward tomorrow
build first pc zero experience 2002 p4 worked first try simply rtfm say following instruction help lot friend building using pc lot longer build dont boot without troubleshooting doesnt follow instruction first build wasnt even mine friend asked help thought experience getting window running confessed never even installed pci card multiple build one build needed troubleshooting motherboard 2 faulty ddr slot changing 2 solved problem
came well said mate
point 2 overemphasized
wise men build motherboard box bare minimum part first make sure thing work gpu one stick ram drive make sure board post ok please list minimum part youd start
think psu switch gave hypertension way often gifemotefreeemotespacksweat
second piece advice especially building people dont take apart old system know new one work already new motherboard cpu memory cooler case get new psu ssd modern cpu onboard graphic boot finish installing first know everything work take gpu old system move girlfriend must loved computer weekend
sammeeeee run mine slot 1 3 instead 2 4 despite manual clearly stating otherwise thought rig fucked couple day
fiddling tciip setting try get communication flow modem
forgot qemm386 doublespacedrivespace dare
last system remarked white motherboard would nice could see thing bit better 5 10 year ill probably build system outside get adequate light
ive never gone wrong gigabyte one board lose one 4 ram slot 5 year theyve solid otherwise
always msi ive two msi mobos doa last two asus fine entire time
year ive 1 asus motherboard flaky flaky mean system crashed time per month enough annoying enough replace said last build went msi asus several issue last several year made shy away
installing window m2 ssd fucking yes whats wrong 14th gen intel
built 14 gen intel asus z790 board zero issue got bios updated first thing smooth sailing
one earth hate m2 screw much
youre saying saved 2300 dollar
enabled xmp profile shit brick motherboard bruh
pay build configure install essential tweak stress test install software test definitely defective board
hard read
yup kept hearing asus z790 mobos posting mediocre thermal performance somewhat lacking feature went gigabyte build last year first time ive ever used gigabyte mobos im honestly surprised em
first build like 99ish play ultima online think ive done 4 build since hopefully 5 soon helped friend maybe 45x ive swapped part like ive done hundred build time kind refresher dont agree op worse though sometimes thing dont go smoothly youd like
im giving advice doesnt need already solved problem came rant roasted
autoexecbat configsys quarterdeck qemm
tell old timer around remember clean autoexecbat configsys run reboot enough ram wing commander big game proud get 600kb free memory lol
remember day going bit trying use old 486 see m do game remember amazed first hard drive 20mb though ever need
didnt believe value software double checked killawatt previous ryzen 3950x setup 200 watt type load shock
oh though making call something wrong left 4 hour less still came back system fan running black screen memory training told wouldnt take 4 hour thats went ahead tinkered
threat percussive maintenance great part failure deterrent
nothing guy know nothing ive built 100 intel amd system practically make sure update bios bios flashback set xmp bios get right speed memory
ram slot right id never put amd air cooler read manual im bad
didcpu one stick ram motherboard psu thats onboard graphic id also check make sure mobo bios compatible cpu though would done getting new component anyways
cpu ram
lost mind hour troubleshooting new build wouldnt turn realize plugged nonfunctioning outlet
mean disable emm386
ive gigabyte board 8 year running 6700k still going strong
ive got gigabyte x99 ultra gaming ek running i7 5960x mighty fine age
finished 9800x3d build gigabyte x870 eagle really glad hear think first time going gigabyte motherboard also 20 year build possibly
msi b650 tomahawk arrived doa current build first ever self built previous prebuilt parent grabbed ebay refurb unit supposedly good condition maybe something fucked refurb side refused boot unless reseated cpu returned ebay refurb program bought exact board working flawlessly love io kinda great budget board like 3 nvme m2 slot great guess everyones experience differ lot
msi come tomorrow finger crossed asus good year back saying current consensus personal knowledge currently hear
went back msi board mostly x870e mpg carbon board layout needed hard find good board extra x1 slot right spot adat card great past ive using asus gigabye x99 3930k build far great
first build asus 810 would say problem controlling fan speed sometimes booting long front audio port didnt work also board wifi big deal mistake 15 year ago really wanted white rog strix new build slept decided didnt want deal possible headache went msi first time
see last time booted ssd cloned m2 ill drive dedicated o rest whatever probably 3 4 random ssdhdd various window understanding 13 14 gen suffer instability due voltage supposedly fixed didnt trust latest build went amd
msi x870e carbon got captured pin spring click place pretty nice
mean 3 personal computer 20 work computer 2300 saved wouldnt look way work computer built pretty straight forward issuesfixes came could replicated since build plus company paid build working hour salaried employee personal computer learning experience definitely put multiple hour
nah board defective
surprised good way bad way asking curiosity also got gigabyte board recently new build
ultima online would loved played exactly though remember thing need refresh others totally agree build last month stressful easier ever remember mostly slot ssds directly mobo day without worry screwing case cable etc brilliant
wing commander made want build first pc 80386 good time
remember day pc get run
yeah true memory training done 10 minute absolute maximum
doesnt onboard graphic always gt 710 side purpose
cpu without cooler
half hot outlet switch
msi b650 arrive doa built current rig two year ago refurb though mine purchased new returned got asus board great since
positive build theyre cheaper feature offer well especially gaming x ax board
yee ive old 2gb pcie gpu dated even medium pc work post check always hand repair shop old breadboard actually building helpful spare basic set part troubleshooting old ie ryzen 1600 cpu flashing bios
hd7770 friend literally gave school joke back lol
ive got 1060 3gb chilling time server around
gtx 580 always boot
nah im pretty sure youd still need cooler otherwise youd fry cpu least researched build general consensus
shortcut building pc check working
hope youre slow definitely arent funny
installation bracket chipset am5intel lga18511700
nice use listed cpu aio also chance experierence aio good cooling would suggest system listed
experience look like nice aio budget build lol
yeah im gon na go head nothing great thing far everything listed bought cheapest ever ill take sign buy aio nothing seemingly go wrong hahai see payback one lucky one stuck buying 3090 ti peak crisis pricesover 2k hurt dayso im happy im getting everything bargain gf older systemalthough im replacing 3090 thing still rock real improvement 4xxx 5xxx series better dlss version lock behind paywall obvious reasonsthe actual gpu perfromance actually almsot 3090 still kick massive as especially right setting outside ingame setting ima buy new gpu gta 6 come pc get bundle game hahathat new gpu listed system kick major assthat plan im buying price low time aroundfuck force buy price spike
would choose 4070ti super 7900xt case 4070ti super would edge productivity like blender slightly better power efficiency 7900 xt offer bit gaming performance vram help last longer newfuture title also come warranty given new
dont really care power efficiency think rt dlss performance worth 7900 xt love playing single player game ray tracing path tracing unsure nvidia advantage matter much 1080p
forget path tracing 7900 xt
recently used 3080ti die lot memory related error game pc turned gpu didnt work think face risk used 4070tis
every piece hardware defective whether used new come used part dont buy people even remotely sketchy always ask test part person even dont intend gauge reaction
see id buying online marketplace buyer protection considering there nothing better 3080 city card working arrival would likely guarantee doesnt refund issue would dying 6 month something like
one say long component last thats warranty always little bit lottery
option want upgrade need replace cpu motherboard ram upgraded i7 9800x3d feelt good
time
see thanks dispose old system sold feel bad disposing current part perfectly fine task
look like reputable seller seems overpriced buying several year old used cpu 100 thats beat cpu buy new today 80 like i312100f save 6070 would cost new mobo though
still insane ten year old quadcore cpu get 6700k 7700 nonk usually lot cheaper basically performance really want 7700k max socket collector sense watch better price lot good luck rhardwareswap sort stuff
dont waste money

usually decent others said protection buyer side said one thing ive learned year enthusiast used cpu there often top line tax whatever highest end cpu gpu extent generation year line chalk combination people older motherboards system still wanting likely upgrade replace dead cpu people wanting something like win7 maxed build something fun case i77700k youre looking qualifies usually mind something akin used iryzen 5 class cpu year ago likely better value would recommend except reliability issue 12th 13th gen intel chip suffered
ebay good buyer protection reread post tricky wording test cpu asap thing like hardware info verify model outside yeah ebay good used hardware like
fuck man paying 77 2025 update motherboard get mile better performance modern i3 ryzen 7600 something mile mile something thatll last another decade least sell old junk buy new junk
ive bought plenty used stuff ebay perfect long seller good reputation good anything else
ebay solid used cpu check seller history buyer protection like others said one thing thats helped avoid overpaying comparing listing historical sold price older bestinsocket cpu often spike randomly ive seen 7700ks actually sell 7580 recently toprated seller there site aggregate ebay deal give perspective market look atm said youre deadset keeping current mobo am4 bundle suggestion better value longterm
dont suck pay hope red bull
ive done several build used cpumoboramgpu never issue ebay
used cpu fine last one bought tiny bit thermal paste side pin 90 isopropyl alcohol preferably 99 extra soft toothbrush pressure applied fixed minute probably would fine want risk there always going risk something working ltt buy think 19 gpus single doa ebays return policy usually cover long pay close attention seller listing part confirmed working work stick ram etc make sure avoid box listing id watch used 1314th gen intels line thats pretty unique situation personally wouldnt bother 7700k though especially ddr4 ram already youre tech savvy enough swap motherboard id instead get am4 motherboard cpu price 20 go am4 thing need careful early b450 motherboards shipped prezen 2 bios get unlucky early b450 bios never updated may sol without compatible cpu update bios like 30 ryzen 5 1600 ill throw amazon resale often openbox b450s around 50 recently manufactured motherboards likely ship bios revision compatible least zen 2 find b450 am4 board 50 preferably b550 used 50 zen 2 ryzen 5 36003600x37003700x 32mb l3 cache alternatively new 80 5500 bench comparably 16mb l3 cache zen 3 much greater chance requiring bios update especially outofbox 3600 fairly comparable 7700k am4s best cpu line throw much powerful 5700x3d thus going motherboard route youll add relevant headroom eventually also go 56005600x57005700x preferably 5700x3d am4 board may need zen 1 zen 2 stepping stone get depending old bios 5700x3d still really darn good cpu outmatched 300 chip may sound like bit pain think handle youre throwing 100 already may well throw extra 20 something upgrade line
honestly pretty safe buy ebay protects buyer seller gotten refund free return shipping item refund return item description always get refund used date someone ebay main source income told someone fill returned box actual rock lost item buyer got money back right seek seller sale dont buy seller zero waste time dealing
personal rule anything used company brand new hell ive personally never seen single person irl internet good experience 2nd hand thing may work others issue buying new far less 2nd hand pc equipment talking much less headache buying new moving dont know thing work using used etc
bought 7950x3d ebay work great
buying 1 decade old cpu genuinely insane
ebay great buyer protection there also trustworthy seller looked selling 1020 cheaper personally would go cheaper option ive ebay alot lately looking upgrade lga1150 i7 4790k cheapest ive found 50 decided time upgrade whole build am4 build since alot used system fb marketplace everyone starting upgrade am5
man might better look used mobo cpu combo support latest socket really limit ridiculously 7700 released 2017 8 year ago using modern rig today would like using gtx 280 card 2015 utterly outdated
similar situation i7 6700k came decisionfuck intel changing socket every 23 year making rebuild whole damn pc want upgrade bought 9800x3d rebuilt pc around instead bought amd instead got 6700k could upgraded 5800x3d good enough computer well revisit 10 year probably longer make sense use am5 socket
i78700 would bios mod
thought dont trust second hand pc part
thank reply ive taken consideration decided buying cpu favor nearfull system upgrade
thank reply decided upgrade mobocpuram slightly expensive cpu futureproof powerful setup
hahaha noted going mobocpuram upgrade 80 instead
yup plus window 11 support 8th gen intel ryzen 2000 series upwards might well get old platform window 10 support end october am4 still great budget option id recommend either comment save little 5700x3d 32 gb ram current setup last several year
reputable store cpumobo bundle aliexpress like szcpu cpu
thank reply indeed going upgrade mobocpuram instead getting 7700k
insightful post like keep coming back reddit
thank detailed wonderful response im going exactly said originally wanted keep mobo since ive 10 whopping year grown oddly attached also never replaced motherboard made incredible point absolutely agree buying i77700k today age would quite foolish outside goal get lga 1151 slot good upgrade rest pc cost less additional 100 well worth eye ive also heard ryzen 5 5500 pair incredibly well gpu amd rx 6600 double win thank indepth response link provided purchasing item hope update thread im done installing
12th gen didnt major issue 1314 gen several issue supposedly fixed degredation one still question dont know run number even timeframe 12th gen solid
thank great information
thank reply
hahaha decide upgrade mobocpuram together instead buying outdated 7700k make much better build way potential future
thank great reply indeed going upgrade mobo benefit whole machine
thank much detailed reply going get b450 am4 board well cpuram upgrade make much better build futureproof
good call id depressed seeing someone pay must choice price 7xxx platform late history aftermarket cold bitch
thats pretty bad pc budget id recommend buying something used
deleted
u mean old pc ebay like
yes consider aliexpress delivery country
offerup facebook marketplace something like
ok
would wait release test decide worth may find used 4070 ti anyway im looking forward buy new 5070 tbh
price little high used 4070ti
know generally used price entire 4070 series absolutely inflated right hope go bit 5070 arrives
bone good pc could buy 5700x3d cpu fastest gpu afford would make nice upgrade
similar setup r7 5800x3d rx 6800non xt run fine never looked bottleneck mainly due variable like ram speed monitor resolution refresh rate
vote upgrade 5700x3d equivalent 7600x level cpu performance upgrade gpu best afford minus 100 2nd nvme 2tb drive 7800xt 500 amazon cheaper ebay one right 429 act fast fantastic upgrade afford give u budget subreddit give great choice
yeah iv looking debating building 7900 xtx 7800x3d might hold
yeah ill probably iv hesitant window driver installed hard drive ill probably slap second ssd 2tb 4tb
upgrading 7800x3d would also require swap ram motherboard 5700x3d would let reuse part
get 5700x3d 7900xtx move 7900 new build get point real wasted money
push past fear losing something clean install nice fresh win install get tub drive downloads pic might surprised many program dont reinstall plus using ssd boot drive night day difference youre really worried go crucial drive come free version aaron true image clone hdd wont lose anything
7800x3d 7900 xtx would separate new build
oh make sense
depends budget personally would new build access mc get cpu msrp
id budget sink gpu less 7800xt wait see cpu youll want 16gb vram enough raw power ps5 pro gpu hopefully scale better time waiting seeing 3600 4070 ti super 6 month im happy yes 3600 cpu comparable technically bottleneck gpu reaching peak performance title eventually untapped potential could needed average title warrant cpu upgrade id capping fps underclocking anyways uncapped fps mean higher utilization 275w maximum power draw gpu electricity bill care much power draw heat generates learned night one overwatch since capped fps soon possible every game upgrade anything wouldnt worry ram especially 3000mhz task manager performance memory check speed say 2133mts probably dont xmpdocp overclock enabled could eventually throw 5700x3d migrate am5 otherwise yes keep build together sell locally least 500gb least ssd storage want keep nvme id guess 500 floor could fetch fair bit due atier psu premium 570x chipset amount ram reason dont keep samsung 970 evo plus especially 1tb
yeah iv looking vram since game eating recentlyi probably go 7800xt debating wait newer card drop see potential price dropand likely get 5700x3d definitely slapping another ssd 24tb
buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead
also try get 7600x3d possible give nice boost gaming
crucial pro ddr5 ram 32gb kit 2x16gb 6000mhz cl36 overclocking desktop gaming memory intel xmp 30 amd expo compatible cp2k16g60c36u5b black
thats cl36 want cl30 pcpartpicker let filter ca latency
thank
appropriate power connector usually two 8pins yeah wont hit high power draw unless hit 3d load doesnt least enough connector fill power socket 6800xt probably wont even try turn
gotcha thanks quick reply
16gb ddr5 5200mhz ram neither
actually read spec 5200 doesnt show cl
man cant believe didnt see thank
youre man cant believe didnt see thank
problem
matter different mhz ram
better keep possible even manufacturer cl etc
tear clean pc part fast dry contact cleaner electronic wait 1 day
gta 6 isnt released requirement list get used rx 6600 adequate power supply
know isnt im asking card professional opinion able run 30fps also im really wanting go used
get b580 budget card market decent value though system old hp g2s youre going get far
look upgradeing cpu worth
nothing upgrade cpu worth time effort
yeah thats thought ok ill upgrade graphic card thanks advice
1 low really realm gpu cpu problem running
probably cpu bottleneck try pushing 1920x1440 crt 85hz
cpu thats problem upgrade x3d chip theyre quite good 1 low
cap framerate
msi afterburner lower 1 turn every monitor setting

answer would need know game cpuram tried capping fps 95
yeah whats cpu game issue
5800x seems many game cant get decent frametimes anything 60fps nowadays new monster hunter cyberpunk weird stutter even though framerate consistent ect
5800x back impressed still able youre asking rest spec window 10 11

also sorry breaking reply pc built back 20172018 except mobo cpu help
kind money buy 5090
powered could driver issue rtx 2000 series eventually phased driver support shouldnt happen time though could also sell 2060 super sentimental wallmount shadowbox
dont sell new card get running
several downside others said
going inhibit airflow new gpu causing higher tempslower performance plus powered generating heat wasting power reason pc also may like insufficiently powered gpu plugged could driver issue conflict along way two wildly different generation especially mix brand system worth sell old gpu dont stuff box basement
might cause problem plugged without power want sure cover gold pin pcie connector kapton tape
amazon resale customer return bent pin return havent issue recently renewed board worst ive seen minor thermal paste smeared heatsinks fingerprint board otherwise clearly new customer return dont bother third party seller amazon stick ebay actual picture used item
long pin arent damaged yeah thats issue used mobos
wouldnt expect issue amazon id read return policy purchase make sure detail however im seeing page look like there 35 difference brand new im spending 200 mobo extra 35 get new instead used make sense mean significant saving id def since amazon easy deal dont know 35 enough saving 200 board selling like 150 id prob jump thats opinion
youre saying shouldnt go one
returned dud
id roll dice amazon great taking return anything
4070 already gigantic upgrade 3060 5070 incrementally better 10900x weak link paired modern 70class better gpu unless youre playing competitive setting id bump gpu first
5070 huge jump especially 1080p youre looking double fps 3060 upgrade cpu well
contact seller request refund dont help get ebay involved protect
amd wont give damn secondhand cpu purchase photograph try straighten pin contact seller cant get work
supposed new used either way id return bother
state bent pin description buyer lose case
used supposed good conditionnever mentioned bent pin came original box
mention bent pin
yeah take ebay

wonderful thanks much ill save post use bios instruction im pretty sure cooler master fit ill get apevia mind big 500w enough would prefer 750 futureand may even need motherboard im remembering part come everything fucked
cpu upgrading 5700x3d worse nonx3d 8core ryzen 5000 cpu stuff like video rendering faster 5600
dont want last thing happen best luck
ryzen 5 2600 almost 6 year old upgrade good upgrade ill definitely look 5700x3d
yeah 5700x3d dominate 2600 load 2700x 5800x3d upgrade upgrade would maybe even little dramatic
would say need cooler recommendation look like price generally going drive hour get 220 may move
eesh 220 148 aliexpress week ago even theyre 200 might recommend grabbing 5600x 80 still like 70 faster 2600 riding bit get latemodel am5 even am6 stuff
gotten everything little bit earlier well 5600x 115 5700x 140 5800x 170 dont think 3d one coming back anything reasonable might 5700x 5800x skip am6 come need next upgrade need part year hopefully degree better job time need better stuff maybe ill find lot money ground year two
come soon want dive gaming new setup hold little longer might snag better deal something futureproof youre itching get back gaming 7900xt still solid pick
stock nvidia 5000 going sell know availability pricing look like believe tarrifs go effect feb 1 likely impact thing fast enough could probably get radeon 9070 probably sell fast shoe id keep 7900 xt good gpu last play today unless youre worried price youre either willing wait play stock tracking game case shoot star
good
would say upgrade pc honesty id think gpu upgrade would help majorly might trick considering run low setting kind budget dont mind
yes could prioritise upgrading gpu also consider upgrade cpu soon take consideration extra power required new gpu check see psu handle
standard part always slowly rapidly upgrade new build start new gpu psu low side motherboardcpuram get nvme
personally wouldnt keep part pre built pc purchased 2016you better building new pc scratch buying new pre built pc
boat upgraded everything day ago 2016 build apart gpu psu since ill replace later marvel rival run like shit dont installed fast drive also decent ram end spending 2 min loading waiting player model spawn personally would upgrade way youre set future since everything way old point
mean playing medium high would nice dont need hit ultra setting enjoy game sure yet since gpu seems super expensive atm maybe around 900 could pay bit need buy full new build
thanks advice im noob tho need open pc check psu couldnt find info anywhere setting
got order would recommend upgrade im sure new gpu would work older motherboard better start cpumotherboard upgrade
try sell 200300 increase budget 1100 build new machine could probably build machine around 7600 xt rtx 4060 within budget could probably go even higher buy used part avoid tax prefer buy new security able return dud
yes get model number google
highly suggest selling system 250ish putting toward budget building new rig
game enjoy playing fairly demanding cpu gpus newer gpus work theyre backwards compatible psu might powerful enough support need figure id probably recommend 3060 new psu first modest upgrade 1650 3050 shouldnt need psu replacement 3060 fast enough play everything new upgrade without feeling like youre completely crippling current cpu want drop faster cpu buy used fairly cheap play id get new cpumotherboardram nvme youre going buy next year id recommend am5 build around 7500f nvme optional people reinstall o getting new motherboard thatd good time buy one even small one like 512gb would worth end really end keeping case hard drive end backup storage always bit recommendation based pure value also giving room grow

sell upgrade gpu
oh wow thanks video give new outlook
even selling gpu wouldnt enough upgrade 3060ti gpu price currently spiking also love 3060ti would rather overclock slight bump upgrade year
youre stuck performance youre already getting plus 6 way get significant performance increase selling 3060 ti upgrading say gpu price currently spiking doesnt mean 3060 ti spike well
necessarily much incentive increase higher 30 series card would better upgrade 40 series card 40 series shortage new used market 40 series going higher demand 30 series card meaning 3060ti still worth around 220 used even used 40 series card upwards 300 easily said post dont fund upgrade besides original question overclocking cpu worth graphic card
overclocking anything nothing special 3060 ti worth 275 300 play card right
cooler using understand wanting run cooler youre danger zone
nope 5800x3d arent really available get 5700x3d even starting get bit scarce get another year least
first rule pc building dont upgrade anything start new build scratch futureproof intention upgrading come time upgrade one start new build scratch rinse repeat
totally agreed especially leveraging pcie lane resizable bar ever id say go full new build team red since tom hardware showed 5090 intel platform performs par 9800x3d4080s
2700x 5600x 5700x3d first
resolution usecase pc budget essential know cant say much relatively cheap upgrade would max am5 getting 5700x3d thats pretty much brainer
spelling
would upgrade gpu something like nvidia geforce rtx 5070 5080
possible find 5700x3d right least one thats reasonably priced
1080p gaming 250 400 buck
sorry english isnt first language
bro im milionare
aliexpress used ebay
5700x3d
aint mine either
desktop gpus similarhttpstechnicalcityenvideoradeonrx7700xtvsgeforcertx4070mobile laptop gpu always limited cooling power
8700g suck 9600x good choice right price 7500f76007600x usually quite bit cheaper little slower 9600x theyre worth looking
thanks lot
saw nvidia stopped sending update see
didnt still supported latest driver driver support go far back 900 series
nvidia ending update 10 series older professional cuda driver support gaming driver still provided youre fine
3060ti still great job even 1440p even run space marine 2 dlss 7080fps go mediumlow newer game 1080p itll great
2060 well might say 1060 starting get outdated
course technology get dated super fast considering uplift performance quality dlss latest implementation youre losing decent amount performance latest rtx 50 series card know
good card course youre talking playing 1080p without question 12gb card could manage game 1440p really depends gamerez youre playing since nvidia still sending update awhile youre good 20 series phased need think support series end soon
1070 still get update lol
people keep asking quesion like still good gpu depends use case right mean gt 640m 10 year ago still ok daily minecrafting
fine 1080p plenty pf people playing new game much worse card 4060 8gb worse lol 2 year old
deleted
ok saw whole article say 30 series likely discontinued future 50 series release
planning playing game 1080p 1440p monitor
recently played ghost tsushima max setting fsr else dropped 35fps
production support
theyre winding manufacturing support
note article mean nvidia stopping making new 3060 chip doesnt mean longer providing driver update 40 series already discontinued except 4060 4050 laptop also doesnt mean nvidia isnt providing driver update either dont worry
try avoid generally look pretty bad prefer go low setting try make 1440p work 60fps
turn medium

buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead
small form factor increase heat noise getting 7600x thing want pretty hard fo small form factor especially first pc build cool quite pc need air flow like said challenging small form factor 4070ti also put good amount heat especially low air flow situation quiet mean low fan rpm probably wont happen need higher fan rpm pump enough air cool system atx mid tower really big imo would make exponentially easier accomplish want also want cl30 ram instead cl36
ok til cl terminology ram whats difference cl30 guess cl36 build
small form factor part cant budge unfortunately limited space know small form factor prone higher temp ideally im trying get thing relatively quiet choosing part dont require much power easy cool im trying render big project anything game browse internet part
cl30 faster
want less heat first part grade gpu pretty hot card 285w tdp 4070 would close half 160w 7600 40w less tdp 7600x would rather x also ram listed wont even work either cpu max speed cpu 5200mts small form factor must compromise noise heat wont thermal throttle certainly heat room definitely silent
7600x non x support 5200 mt
gotcha lower faster ill change ram
ah good call ram didnt consider max speed cpu power draw 4070 ti super concern seemed like pretty big jump wanted little future proof game line maybe 4070 super may better option
officially yes basically 7000 series cpu allow overclock ram 6000 mt amd even testing official benchmark data speed
4070 temp future proof opposite side spectrum 4070 solid mid range card yes 4070ti better

okay thanks
found corsair ram set support list motherboard ryzen 9000 series version listed part number version number part number support list mean work fine regardless version

done previous research kept popping 4070 bottleneck type cpu running would still recommend 4070 also initial question affect pc way switching intel amd would need reinstall window switching run issue switching component
done previous research kept popping 4070 bottleneck wont bottleneck httpsyoutubecefydhbccwt4httpsyoutubecefydhbccwt4 8600g perform even better since faster 5600g
wait

mind explain ty

x370mhdv r40 thats generation hdv board garbage power delivery doesnt even 8pin cpu connector 4pin vrm heat sink crappy vrms could motherboard could overheating shutting cpu pulling much power long ive able get better board sometimes stupid pc thing fun try running ram without xmp base speed ddr42133 said doesnt glitch running one stick try stick individually ram problem could also motherboard hdv board minimum viable product would way test ddr43600 speed anyway since amd cpu bioses time board release didnt snowball chance hell actually running ram fast board might able sustain speed sort stability testing low clock help rule stick pass memtest individually
try clearing cmoshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfgpfhfokgi try reseating cpu
yes 4 pin connector cpu great info man ty much didnt know motherboard minimum viable product lol probably need better motherboard handle rest component nicely speed thing ram tricky run 3600 speed im using 1 stick use 2 stick shuts even 2400 speed im gon na try stick time 2133 speed let u know happens
sound much like signal integrity synchronization issue would also point motherboard
plug pump cpuopt run 100 time connect rad fan cpufan header
alright thanks
also think connect 3 chassis fan single splitter run 1 header considering ill need splitter 2 anyway
fine
install fresh copy window new ssd
hoping avoid keep file drive think way
file wont affected install ssd unplug hdd install window 11httpsyoutubeikiuk4npgow new nvme ssd window installed turn pc plug sata hdd back sata hdd become secondary drive file still
sound good gon na give shot thanks help gifemotefreeemotespackslightlysmiling
theyre exact fine
speed especially random speed always going higher completely empty drive doesnt o running data o running overhead various thing data refreshing wear leveling etc well o overhead
pcpartpickercom list verify case compatible back connect motherboards theyre rather new rare nice 4k gift
ill play devil advocate say 5090 would absolutely unnecessary really want 50 series get 5080 mean get unlimited budget stuff unless brother ai learning wont need
could spend much less would experience could get 4000d case around 100 7800x3d around 450500 cpu cooler could get thermalright anywhere 40150 mobo b650 tomahawk 180 however doesnt seem like youre pinching penny build would also absolute monster pc
look amazing tbh motherboard part id question look great x870e board instead youre spending much beautiful build though im sure bro happy pretty sure project zero like 200 wouldnt even pay tbh
generous sibling first would recommend aware msrp 5080 gpu 9800x3d cpu top line great choice afford since gpu yet released cpu stock listed price site like amazon currently resellers much higher ever pay dont pay 1200 5080 500 9800x3d even looking best currently available price main thing would recommend component mentioned swap part provide level quality half cost less maybe use money purchase new monitor show feature project zero 650 motherboard cool bear mind cable anyway gpu aio reason may want go x870 board show specific request brother keep there many aio thermal right cool look good cost much less ram choice good case good maybe try get pick case directly havent feel free ask specific question
ask parent adopt lol serious note nice rig dominator ram little wasteful good ram though nice otherwise
overkill thatll hitting 150fps game 4k high setting thing id suggest maybe going x670e instead b650m b650m support pcie 40 wont make full use 5000 series future gpus
5080 9800x3d gamers paradise plus dont cheap power supply look cultist list psu tier list rev 170ghttpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist would also check amazon pc builder newegg pc builder pcpartpickercomhttppcpartpickercom
didnt even realise website lmao yeah im quite unwell lol im worried spending fair bit gift better someone us money
also use extra money get x670 chipset
wasteful ram one part dont understand well
basically paying branding cl30 6000mhz set dominator thing cl30 6000mhz set kingston fury example unless youre going extreme length tinkering even
okay thankyou ill take another look compare
depends gaming really cheaper ssds work fine gaming
hell samsung ssds never worth cheaper drive
reliability issue batch 980s 990s shipped bad firmware fixed within month identifying confirming issue t500 good drive 30 saving worth nvme v nvme youre likely ever notice actual speed difference daytoday unless youre always dealing large amount data time
boot drive work include fea photo editing separate drive prepared gaming drive
pick cheapest board find feature want basic 100 b650 board would work combo
ok
4070 super 1520 less rasterized performance bad 12 gb limit vram could become problem year 2k resolution especially shit game optimization lately better ray tracing better frame generation better upscaling would get 7900 xt especially since cheaper think 4070 ti super would rather buy nvidia personally
7900 xt based pure performance alone also 20gb vram good plus especially higher re title struggle eating 2k 4070 super want rt dlss etc etc
4070 860 pure insanity got gigabyte 7900xtx official refurb 800 gigabyte 4070ti super official refurb 600 know 40 series discontinued price rise make sense 5070 coming around feb 20 better 4090 u cant wait go 7900xt card 4070s worth anything beyond 500 opinion sell 500 china thats highest taxed place know
7900xt question 7900xt stack better 4070ti super still beat performance
according everyone right 4070 super better option dlss4 new hot commodity 7900xt better raster doesnt come fancy nvidia stuff id personally get 7900xt decide
yeah tax insane bunch thief country lol thanks brother
thats unfortunate yeah u wait wait 50 series u cant go 7900xt since 7900xt widely regarded 4k card 4070s struggle max setting 2k u dont ray trace much really want new gpu right go 7900xt
igpu generally turned default
thanks cant seem get signal monitor possibility maybe wait gpu
2 digit code top right mobo say
55
ok pc isnt posting thats displaying google search asus post code 55 mean follow suggest
970 nvme ssd compatible motherboard think compatible
plan upgrading 1440p ultrawide monitor definitely wait rtx 5070 even generational performance uplift big past resolution even compute intensive 1440p want gpu last least 5 year youre going need every percentage point boost framerate
7900 gre option tends less expensive 4070 super good margin noticeable lead performance card overclocked point time im sure disappointment shitwreck 5070 even faster 4070 super rasterization almost 17 less cuda core 4070
consider 7900gre well
rtx 4070 super long get reasonable price
since mention vram would look 16gb card anything past couple generation smoke 970 bang buck 7800xt featurerich would 4070 ti super 4070 super great card limited 12gb vram really problem today since looking holding card long time targeting ultrawide screen would consider 16gb option
cant beat value picked 4070s getting 130140fps iracing everything highultra 49inch ultrawide 1440p big upgrade 3060ti
would buy oldest one acceptable theoretically get bang buck would go either 3000 4000 amd try well
buy afford always new card 5070 come people ask wait ti super get afford
7900xt beat
4070 super cope 1440p
thank
okay wasnt aware 5070 much letdown wasnt considering 7900gre good 650w psu im bit worried might bit much seeing price buy new psu price difference maybe make sense need think thank
want use gpu five year ultra wide monitor upscaling definitely going tool he going use amd announces rdna3 getting fsr4 support wouldnt buy one time horizon
thank answer 4070ti super expensive im aware vram concern didnt know could make much difference playing ultrawide maybe ill look amd
2nd ended getting 4070 super never even one problem play whatever want doesnt even flinch lol tried go cheaper vram amd ended problem luck draw suppose got tired headache troubleshooting went 4070 super best idea ever lol troubleshooting work 12gb def enough vram always turn setting little lost demanding thing anyway honestly cant even tell difference high ultra every setting
tried ac evo chance im playing ams2 really want jump evo 10 come im wondering good enough good experience
see 3080 selling 400usd given want last im sure going 2 gen back would 3080 meet requirement 5 year
totally get close launch maybe make sense thats im considering new amd card already far line consider could wait month 50 series
ala 1440p ultrawide gpu calculate 34 pixel
thats main thing im considering reasoning framegen help inevitably gpu start enough see many mixed comment im sure much sense make
youre welcome clear dont think 12gb going problem 3080 12gb ultrawide run vram issue yet think 4070s viable option right 5 year road could different story looking gpu today take 2030 ultrawide panel would shopping 16gb vram
thank feedback rx470 8 year issue died got 970 strapped cash said think prefer 4070 paper feedback solidifies im trying think long term comment say 7800xt7900gre would last longer im pickle hard predict future guess haha
bought game tried 3060i struggling setting medium im gon na give 4070 try later still havent found good setting guide since game new
would recommend going mid end card 3080 last 5 year probably might able buy 2 3060 money last almost 8 year depends requirement would go good priced 3080 maybe 4060 good deal
whats opinion going 7800xt7900gre course impossible know fact see 5070 benchmark based spec think 5070 potential better longer taking dlss account unless thats crap havent tried reviewer surely dont standard coming 1080p60
make sense think ill looking 7900gre nvidia option 16gb vram expensive im still hoping clearance 50 series start actually selling wont keep hope thank
remove protective plastic film cold plate cooler
yeah double checked make sure plastic film removed ive also tried shaking radiator since apparently thats factor sometimes
850w apevia psu might barely cut rtx 4080 safer go 1000w psu higher proart usually targeted creator like video editor designer performancewise awesome gaming youre primarily gaming cheaper option similar performance like regular rtx 4080 founder edition nonproart model use case fractal design north goodlooking case decent airflow rtx 4080 big card doublecheck case fit properly especially considering length gpu 360mm radiator airflow key making sure enough intake exhaust fan must keeping everything cool since build includes i714700kf unlocked overclocking tweaking extra performance consider zseries motherboard like z690 z790 take advantage h610 motherboard fine stock performance wont let unlock full potential cpu
confusing build helped choose part using gaming productivity bunch change would personally recommend something like httpsaupcpartpickercomlistywjx2x would work better gaming think current build doesnt make much sense arent using australian pcpartpicker build wouldnt come stated budget 2500 aud either building pc using 14700k 200 overpriced 4080 super model using ddr4 ram cheapest po mobo ever dont get record 14700k ok option planning heavy dual use productivity task otherwise reason buy intel 5700x3d best option could get immediate performance price range depending resolution want game 7600x would also perfectly viable would get am5 platform isnt dead like older amd current intel platform
thanks info ill take consideration also switch cpu amd ryzen 9700x sorry late reply
wow ok thanks help making change build didnt know many issue wasnt using australian one used link guy helped sent
performance i714700kf beast 20 core great multitasking content creation gaming ryzen 9700x also really solid 8 core 16 thread awesome gaming youre planning thing like video editing run bunch stuff i7 might give bit power price ryzen tends better value youre mainly focused gaming 9700x could save cash still delivering great performance motherboard go ryzen youll need new am5 motherboard like b650 x670 add little extra cost am5 platform solid future upgrade i714700kf need lga1700 motherboard also fine something keep mind power efficiency ryzen chip usually bit powerefficient youre something run cooler us less power ryzen might good shout youre mostly gaming want save money ryzen 9700x excellent choice youre looking allaround performance thing like streaming editing multitasking i714700kf give bit juice
ok fair enough well context build going 3200 aud hoping use system gaming resolution monitor type game want play edit also much ability upgrade pc next 13 year matter
pc gaming mainly play soulslike game would like run emulated bloodborne smoothly thinking getting either 1440p 4k monitor probably wouldnt upgrading pc time soon ability upgrade component would nice also thanks informing price
btw another thing power supply selected doesnt price something worry like stock
ok pc linked solid option problem running older amd platform easy upgrade gpu want able easily upgrade want get something like httpsaupcpartpickercomlistdqj974 ryzen 7600 basically intro chip am5 platform faster ddr5 ram still alive least 1 2 generation much easier future cpu upgrade want also threw 7900 xtx consideration performs within error 4080s normal rasterized game performance 200 cheaper au caveat nvidia better ray tracing better frame generation better upscaling technology care thing
yeah mean available au retailer website sorry missed gone swapped u site try buying instead httpsaupcpartpickercomlistgj9zkf
hm ok thats lot think lol idk witch one choose possible swap ryzen 5700x3d 7600 without change gpu would make price bit far budget tbh im happy long get good fpsdollar pc powerful enough handle almost anything throw game wise good year sorry trouble lol mind choosing
thanks bro also wow getting expensive fast thanks help though
clarify cpu installed compatible motherboard am5 recent amd platform name am4 older one 5000 series cpu work am4 platform mean older motherboard older ddr4 ram newer am5 platform 7000 series 9000 series run requires newer motherboard us newer faster ddr5 ram trying say choose first build linked 5700x3d stuck older platform unable upgrade cpu ram without buying whole new motherboard compatible newer hardware buy 7600 build using b650 motherboard ddr5 ram could pretty easily upgrade ram cpu since still make new stuff compatible motherboard gpu doesnt care gpus basically universal modern purpose meaning plugged motherboard long power supply big enough power work upgrade whenever want could use either gpu linked either build matter position would probably choose buy 7600 newer platform easier upgrade would also probably buy 7900 xtx thats mostly dont care much ray tracing upscaling frame generation game play fine paying extra 200 4080 super probably better playing 4k since better upscaling technology want play 1440p would totally fine 7900 xtx
yes unfortunate reality modern pc gaming exchange rate also isnt favor also clear pretty close top line build long reasonable expectation kind quality get brand new game release could easily last 4 year longer really dont care playing high setting ray tracing
ok well dont really care ray tracing stuff frame generation ai generated frame thing like 50 series right dont really care guess 7900 go ill still getting good fps able run basically game 2nd build basically 1st build right probably stupid question idk lol btw thanks lot help
yes much either build first build slightly better slightly expensive mentioned good upgrade option without replacing mobo edit also yes correct frame generation stuff one legitimately cool piece tech nvidia dlss upscaling technology basically allows gpu render game 1440p us ai upscale rendered frame 4k quality 1080p 1440p etc new dlss update came 50 series apparently really insane doesnt leave behind many shimmer random artifact evidence upscaling happening amd version technology called fsr quite good
ok thanks guess ive decided ill go cheaper build sound like smarter pick downside cant say ive got 4080 super gpu pc lol thanks help

5700x3d much better value upgrade honestly last am6
resolution play think itd substantial upgrade
would use completely stop working would save money point need replace
wait 2029 upgrade minimum
upgrading nvidia geforce rtx 5070 would definitely boost performance massive margin cpu still good
others said 5700x3d would amazing value could pair 5070 5070 ti 9070xt beast machine personally id go 5070 ti 9070xt 16gb vram edit 5700x3d quickly running stock youre going upgrade id first get gpu bit later since gpu wait bit since itll stock 5700x3d likely wont
geforce 3090 many game see cpu bottleneck gpu doesnt run 100 debating whether go 9800x3d better gaming slightly higher cost 7800x3d keep video card another gen 2
ah see big upgrade 5700x3d comparez 3900x
massive upgrade x3d chip real deal best value am4 cpu

might well wait day check 50 series although feeling make card going sell second anyway doesnt hurt wait 3 day ended getting 4080s fe brand new like 800 last month
rip rtx 2080ti true beast card say wait 50 series snag someone unwanted 4070s buy 5070 look good money
suit current spec though thats im confused
suit current spec
may slight bottleneck shouldnt bad though
tight budget 5700x3d sure get am4 board cheap still perform great game ddr4 especially compared intel would cheaper look also perform better lot game
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmytdj2eco4 google friend shit video 13600kf little better get deal 5700x3d put saving better gpu thatd best tho like mobo ram 5700x3d bundle maybe idk
gpu going important cpu gaming go i5 25 performance x3d forget 4070 way overpriced id go 6800 16gb 7700s 12gb 7700 8 better performance 6800 100 cheaper right ddr5 6000 cl30 pretty good price right board comparable price ddr4 board noctua cooler cpu best selfcontained gpu radiator cooler going good price comparable highend air cooler 1440p 144hz monitor youre going notice difference 144hz 240hz resolution king see better dont skimp psu go minimum 850w 80 gold must skimp somewhere list id go ddr4 memory board leave enough get nice case

reason choose am5 right expensive peru post am5 mobos price 220 usd mad crazy fucking mobo am5 processor ram ssd price within reasonable range thing kill mobo price edit found 125 usd b650 mobo amazing realized ram price ridiculous am5 still question
oem motherboard support upgrade am4 cpu stick non oem am4 board upgrade option
whats usage processor dont officially supported win 11 something youd want
work compatible full bus speed used later upgrade pcie45 mobo
really think thought bc motherboard 30 version outdated
pcie backwards compatible
ah ok thank guy
probably coil whine annoying usually problem
yes mid tower case
trouble fitting came 6 standoff
box screw rear case contains rest
thx bit confused cause watching ltt said install correct amount ot standoff ur motherboard
pc worth 300 said replace item much less 16gb ram run 25 decent psu 50 60 air 7
whats budget
preferably 100150 rather
cpu choice would helpful starter

best motherboard info provide doesnt narrow looking crazy expensive wether looking
note pcie 50 completely unnecessary today foreseeable future
asrock b650mhm2 99 come wifi m2 wifi port add wifi adapter mean upgrade wifi adapter micro atx board think look cleaner compact case two dim socket thats need go dual 48gb module money saved mobo board solid great value one kid pc 6950xt 7600x he playing everything dont need 870 unlesd want faster usb extra m2 slot b650 fine board paired 7600x 300 32gb ram dual 16 50 get 100 2tb m2 drive cheap case fsp sp vita 1000 cpu gpu youre gtg minus gpu 634 atm room budget go another 270 happen live near micro center 9800x3d instead minus graphic processor youll best rig
cheapest x870
go pcpartpickerhttpspcpartpickercomproductsmotherboard check feature want side bar sort price skip brand dont like
generally speaking motherboards arent fast slow elaborate
youre thinking pick one feature actually need enough usb port support
gigabyte x870e pro ice love enough io port connector white look freaking awesome planning build white pc
best period would probably one msi meg godlike asus maximus extreme im partial msi though tend better customer support less qc issue recently gaming midrange x870 fine ive eyeing msis x870 carbon though little bit higher end
whats best motherboard currently msi meg series currently cant find good motherboard definition good trying find motherboard support gen 45 stuff performs fast would help knew cpu mind looking crazy expensive overly cheap one idea without knowing exact cpu best advise meet fairly easy meet parameter msi mag series asrock riptide series asus tuf series fairly balanced feature set solid power delivery
dont know im guessing amd am5 itx really cheap option itx though asrock amd b850i lightning wifi 7 socket am5 ryzen ddr5 8200 mhz 128gb mini itx motherboard m2 sata3 60 gb pcie 50 b850
depends consider best am5 vrm design teaming doubler since quite often related slow boot memory issue two best mb perspective msi godlike asrock x870e taichi since relation msi poor 33 hw went defective rely asrock
thats inclusive category like whats best food whats best hammer
gaming sorry didnt elaborate
think one major site benchmark 5090 50 1 faster 40 got ta chase minmax httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscaling28htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090pciexpressscaling28html
oh really guess ill go 40
oh interesting ill check
like performance wise unless dont still sorta new
amd intel make big difference amd beat intel gaming however
mean youre spending 2k gpu alone might well
basically need decide want mobos dont affect performance unless extreme overclocking get reliable board manufacturer like msi gigabyte asrock asus fine pick based look look back panel make sure usb connector want support cpu get
amd
im going recommend one doesnt need backplate ive great luck asrock motherboards also make sure motherboard fit case
wouldnt try justify purchase reddit post enjoy new card man run game fine
250 cheapest ive seen uk got decent price good upgrade budget imo long dont expect max setting newest game youll happy
decent price 4060
good price run dlss needed 4060 fine 1080p even done lighter 1440p dlss setting turned dont think bad card lack vram small memory bus amd better card 400
exact upgrade havent regretted 1440p monitor well run everything medium setting dlss 4 massive improvement performance quality dont sweat
yes definitely rtx 4060 awesome entry gpu perfectly reasonable price lot rtx 4060 hater enjoy gpu
im thinking getting card hoping would go nearer 200 mark thats wishful thinking getting arc b580 original 259 going wont happening amd a770 pretty powerhungry card
excellent price performance enjoy
bought mine 300 usd year ago arent necessarily best performancetoprice ratio good card regret choice enjoy
obviously worth 250
250 good price im sure 8gb version still good deal
yes im happy mine
depending area could bought 3060ti price gotten better performance 4060 4050 misnamed said card better 1660 almost every way dont sweat small shit use new card
spend bit get 6750xt
guess massive upgrade current one anyway
90 isnt bit lol barely could afford 4060
lot
upgraded 1070 4060 well im loving
people seem forget part
b550f gaming wifi ii tell thing bitch find ram like
maybe try listen motherboard speaker telling manual hand didnt find anything
yeah dont think ram problem one ive used year confused doesnt stay certain led light alternate 3
interesting wish could help im technically pretty computer illiterate
youre window change background every time also could gpu driver issue would ddu install latest driver fresh mine thing whenever update driver reset background setting issue
nope background remains though granted use background monitor cause im lazy ill check gpu driver dont know updated recently cause everything set auto update ill try see fix issue
m2 drive small get 2tb even 4tb otherwise system beautiful here drive would get 4tb good httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb0d9wtkv1b
tweaked list question change ask httpspcpartpickercomlistgxj974 also please god dont buy b580 400 highway robbery keep eye listing preferably find one 250280 restock b570 also fine option 10 less powerful actually stock close msrp 220 often dont want wait around intel card restock look 6750 xt 320 right 10 faster b580
5070
upgraded 6950 xt 3060ti happy felt like real enough jump get secure hitting 144 fps 1440p game like play 7800 xt basically 6950xt would vote
rtx 5060 starting look like repeat 4060
buy ddr56000 cl30 ram instead
buy arctic liquid freezer iii 360 instead
thought corsair vengeance 32gbhttpspcpartpickercomproduct6bsv3ccorsairvengeance32gb2x16gbddr56000cl28memorycmk32gx5m2b6000z28
good choice

wouldnt recommend intel cpu gaming right
someone correct im wrong budget would opt ddr5 capable motherboard
gaming would lot heavily multithreaded task gaming id go amd ryzen 9700x price faster 14700k gaming 9600x slightly slower actually end faster 14700k paired ddr4 h610 amd cpu also acheive level performance less half power draw problem h610 motherboards designed used low power cpu less 65w 14700k work performance limited less see 14600k review though quite low 14400 naturally l basically youre paying ton extra cpu get much return ddr4 v ddr5 less impact still enough bring 9600x
really why recommend
wouldnt know im guessing thats betternewer motherboard probably right pcpartpicker say motherboard isnt compatible cpu reason doesnt seem like huge problem ill check motherboard recommended
thanks info bro also yes gaming ill switch amd ryzen 9700x guess specific recommendation motherboard budget slightly flexible could spare another 100 budget needed also sorry im new pc building lol
intel cpu use ton power perform worse amd x3d cpu problem burning due voltage regulation problem intel claim fixed voltage issue dont know sure worked addition platform never new cpu amd committed support am5 platform least 2027
someone probably explain depth ddr type ram ddr3ddr4ddr5 ddr5 newest higher frequency motherboard support 1 type ram would need ddr5 motherboard motherboard also specific socket type cpu theyre compatible pretty big deal personally went amd cpu socket little universal giving option upgrade cpu without needing new motherboard road
msi b650 gaming plus wifi gigabyte b650 gaming x ax v2
hmm ok think understand would amd cpu able support 4080 super also amd cpu think get instead keeping mind budget compatibility
thanks info apparently ddr5 motherboards compatible msi pro b760p wifi ddr4 good enough found pcpartpicker seemed like decent option
yes absolutely look 7800x3d
im familiar intel cpu would check partpicker cpu mentioned lga1700 socket compatible plenty ddr5 motherboards including msi pro b760 would check partpicker make sure dont still ddr4 ram added filter
yeah think ram problem thanks btw guy sent whole new build much trouble tell better httpsaupcpartpickercomlistywjx2xhttpsaupcpartpickercomlistywjx2x
mean back exposed
expected backside pcb hdd would exposed u sure situation would need see picture youre talking
updating bios
without booting computer
yes need another pc like family friend flash drive
ok mean like family friend saying pc identical
another pc use go motherboard website download latest bios use friend family pc
dont need adapter use native 16 pin cable
adapter included people psu without 16pin connector save time start asap waste time adapter searching case needed
epic thanks fast reply also thought would better less connection chance decoupling would reduced save pop tempered glass panel shattering order another replacement gifemotefreeemotespacksob
queue depth testing
im using built benchmark samsung magician sure default also thermal issue drive doesnt move 51c forgot mention motherboard massive heatsync pipe vapor chamber hella overkill
try crystaldiskmark
link site people use download normally seem bit sketch there like 20 id really appreciate ill give test
clean reinstall always good idea get fresh system trash collected within year week install new drive copy everything need old drive erase keep backup old drive clonning use resizing option clonning tool support total storage size doesnt mater case data size realy stored mater 1t hdd 200gb 800g free data clonned 256g ssd 56g free
sound good thankyou uhh go sorry im dumb

rbuildmeapc
go r buildmeapc read sidebar thatll give info make post someone give build website logical increment premade build different budget give good idea theyll play resolutionframerate
1 dont buy used psu 2 buy used cpu gpu possible 3 dont purchase anything intel newer 12th gen
httpspcpartpickercomuserjwitmansavedrwbf4d want pretty much cheapest good build make right question let know
head rbuildapcforme want someone hand full pc build
little bioswhat hwinfo say max core frequency running cpu intensive app
floating workload cpu dropping frequency ok check load inside o
budget go 16gb x 2
could buy 8 gb stick make sure perfectly matched might get performance stability problem budget 2x16 gb reliable
depends currently get identical speed trying run current stick singlerank check cpuz note talking rank channel get another set singlerank dimms timing ok going four stick current stick dualrank potential able get four stick running xmp speed
one 5070 yet fake comparison chance wont able get one 550 couple month release anyways id get 4070 super youre gon na waiting unless get lucky launch day
damn thinking maybe got news medium demo kinda like ltt got 4090 offically hit shelf 4070 super good upgrade 2070 right
huuuuge upgrade basically double framerate game youre cpu limited dont care raytracing dlss little tech savvy case driver issue mostly play generally rasterized game might also want look 7900xt around price point performs better 4070 super closer 4070ti super otherwise 4070 super great card
thanks sadly im savvy come pc gaming stuff find plug n play type still apreciate help though thank
driver installed o bios option download driver stick different device even internet cafe public library use ether net cable get wired internet access download driver give
issue install win 11 bypassing internet requirement installed driver afterwards lan wifi didnt work installed driver
could buy pcie wifi card m2 wifi chipset connect internet install driver return adapter
run ethernet connect still light flashing cable either
also download stick bios flash enter computer without changing pin need connection
way could tether wifi connection possibly another computer dont think apple allows phone
see first line need login install driver o bios cant login hard drive need go professional access data
youd need wifi driver mobo connect tether

gracias por tu gran ayuda
use pcpartpicker build guide adjust needed yes am5 build way go 3060ti grabbing 5070ti p
even 5090 loses 1 performance pcie 40 lower card even less f difference
video post id like readwatch
mb would recomend black am5 live near microcenter preferably 150200 could go bit

usb bios flashback feature update 100 even already supported box
one favorite b650 board ive built several machine one right 9700x middle testing 6400cl30 2200fclk
easy make
im letting
discord browser doesnt count multitasking probably dont need 64gb ram 7800xt could run 1440p check civ like core could get 7700x
didnt know civilization 6 hard run 9600x 7800xt enough run anything point time near future new gpus coming amd nvidia soon though might wait price get better
im ruined
doesnt modded civ use stupid amount ram
idea played 5 fine 32gb
get 7600x perform nearly identically
difference 7600x 9600x website im buying 14 think worth extra 9600x doesnt matter
14 probably worth difference
yeah agreed think literally like 2 difference average sure 14 buck whatever
mean whooshing sound making cmos reset nothing make cpu light come well added whooshing weird sound
reseat ram
water separator compressor generally shouldnt use one clean
nah worthwhile
4k barely difference techpowerup show 1 difference relative performance 4k
far ive issue 13700k could lucky 4k 5090 fine 13700k
might gain faulty chip anything close worth
worth risk intel asked 13700k 9800x3d would respond hell yeah
first fine gambling instability issue answer maybe 4k game largely gpu bound although cpu faster might translate real world fps gain
dont risk 13900ks 14700k faulty also tom hardware review 13700k5090 1080p equivalent 9800x3d4080s 9800x3d 4k able observe nvidia claimed 30 improvement 4090 u want 5090 4k fps 4090 better upgrade 9800x3d
budget issue get 9800x3d
make think wont
get 9800x3d
wont able buy 5090 whole new build aswel wonder difference would 13700k 9800x3d 4k
5090 upgrade maybe ram currently 32gb 6000
wont upgrading whole pc 5090 thats much
gpu
meant cpu recently went 13700k 9800x3d high difference performance 1440p even 4k see difference 1 low aff ct smoothness game
32gb ram plenty unless playing specific game use m flight sim
dude gpu part whole pc asking cpu upgrade 9800x3d cpu yes need new mobo worth
5090
suppose could use current ram 32gb 6000mhz
yes
hyper 212 small like p 120 se 5070 fe nv intl ship
212 x duo think wont enough gpus mostly retain retail value dont mind swapping future much
yes 212 small
ok might go deepcool ak620
part equation corsair make ton psus id say seasonic consistently high quality psus make less
corsair good brand also sell crap lot enough reinforces opinion brand name doesnt mean lot regard power supply biggest issue generally overpriced relative competition example earlier helped guy selected corsair rm1000x 2021 build really good power supply 190 overpriced obsolete 135 get quiet pure power 12 1000w basically built good equal 10 year warranty built newer atx3x standard corsair usually really good doesnt mean best option would like see listing youre considering may better option price possibly less youre considering
corsair bread butter memory like micron dedicated power supply brand seasonic
corsair good rm850 powering system 2 evga power supply die one actually burnt good small like big power supply
well wait bit could get 9950x3d skip go amd treadripper
look threadripper line pricey though yeah 9800x3d x3d general gaming productivity
want rendering gaming think want wait 9950x3d like others saying
9950x 3d latest intel core 9 probably better editing workstation load really good gaming
gaming 9800x3d 9950x3d near identical use amd core parking utility newer generation cpu beat older gaming 9800x3d substantially faster 7000 chip 9000 chip
think use case depends way gpu cpu buy 9950x3d gaming 9950x still want lean productivity call day answer question powerful overall definition fastest depends whether measure single multicore cache size plethora feature associated chip amd topoftheline epyc threadripper cost 10 grand cant say experience
absolute fastest powerful server processor xeon platinum 8593q 12400 128 smt core amd epyc 9965 14813 192 smt core comically expensive bad term performance per price rendering blender often want many core possible 7950x3d would probably better 9800x3d opposite true game usually cant use couple thread would go one two gen older x950x3d even thread ripper enough single threaded performance threadripper processor also heavy premium consumer processor x950x3d high server processor
fastestbest 4k editing premier pro im going intel 14900k 285k fastestbest gaming 1080p say 5090 9800x3d best value rounder 14700k 265k
yes yes
9950x3d going faster powerful 9800x3d first pc build apologize dumb question
gon na say 9950x3d thing going beast forsure
got go one thanks help guy
mean im going noticeable decrease quality game like microsoft flight simulator kerbal space program difference noticeable first person shooter super high frame rate cause dont plan playing game like
im mostly going 3d modeling 4k video editing game realistically going ever play microsoft flight simulator 2025 kerbal space program space engine
oh yikes definitely afford lol id rather buy car money like
14900k currently come around total build price 265k thats probably pick price v performance intel built 14900kf based system friend similar usage installed afternoon id personally gone 265 wanted absolute performance could wring budget
yes gaming slightly worse task yeah
youre comparing v 7950x3d shouldnt much difference 9950x3d get best world much better gaming performance v intel still get 16 core video editingrendering
stick 9950x9900x
9800x3d still king gaming
im mostly going 3d modeling 4k video editing game realistically going ever play microsoft flight simulator 2025 kerbal space program space engine would noticeable difference game like
9950x3d v 9800x3d major drop quality game like one mentioned
got got confused youtube video ive seen say 9800x3d powerful cpu ever created others say actually great content creation meanwhile im like well best best best one best lol
im sure recommend task
gaming productivity task suffer since 9950 double ammount core 9800
got ill go 9950 thanks help
stop using bottleneck calculator random arbitrary made number meaningless clickbait site scamming click r5 7500f 7600 7600x r7 7700 7700x r9 7900 7900x gaming performance clock speed game dont require 6 core overclocked 7500f going perform around 7900 dont want spend much

company make software us nvidia hardware surely mean hardware company trouble gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
nvidia loose ai race literally making bank deepseek us nvidia chip lol
dipshits tariff plan rolling back chip act
nope anything expect price going increase u economic stuff get put motion
nvidia basically shovel seller goldrush people overreacting even demand nvidia product would go price wont due trump tarrifs tsmc
lol thats think
lol
hahahahaha lost ai race start race man thing happened ai everything might pop nothing else people involved tech side already know need nvdia share overhyped llm basically ia right possible thanks new gpus deepseek answer nothing change
bless
china bot
nvidia didnt lose ai race race getting started deep seek using nvidia chip win deepseek making splash market shaving 400600 billion nvidias value mean nvidia might lower price try regain value could also double price home pc user barely affect bottom line u gpu price arent going trump tariff actually happen sony said cause ps5 pro go 1000 assume nvidia amd affect similarly looking 10001200 mid range gpus 500700 entry level gpus
deepseek us nvidia hardware lol
tech company dont use gaming gpus ai anything get worse deepseek actually run consumer grade stuff mean people using gaming gpus play model know plus tariff coming lol country dont pay tariff consumer
yup think yesterday beating came leak trump chip tariff plan announcement deepseek tariff skyrocket gpu price actually happens
deepseek used old nvidia chip didnt need lot compared ai company nvidia stock tanking hard theyre definitely losing clear dont need latest greatest chip run stuff
ni hao
yeah used old gpus latest stuff
use cable different psu could fry magic smoke bad sign cutting power right move advise taking professional
smoke started come capacitor presumably power supply since straight away plugged another computer id bought multimeter tested voltage risking hardware smoke come somewhere motherboard got photo
nope used one came psu
yes came capacitor near gpu pcie x16 slot even smelled mobo accurate ik thats component smell fried
reset bios
assuming work way keep secure boot would manually enable every time wanted play game
amd motherboard totally fine dont like
need higher end motherboard cpu pull alot power amd cpu efficient enough run even 9700x 9800x3s motherboard
would either spend something like 7700x 7600x3d bundle go 12700k bundle upgrade am6 7600x bundle isnt great
every time look see problem 1 40 second boot even post january 2025 seems related ram 2 problem ram compatibility asus seems acknowledge people multiple rmas repeatedly getting said problem 3 micro atx smallest shitty form factor feature possible i7 full atx many featuresslots 4 asus general known buggy shitty motherboard experience am5 according reddit post people reccomending paying 30 avoid asus am5
1 2 general issue platform microatx simply mean less pcie slot going use
1 2 time fixed enabling memory context restore setting ram voltage bit higher something like 14v 145v
1520 single tower cooler work fine
thank appreciate
httpspcpartpickercomproductqxyfrh dont need much cooling system gpu component produce substantial heat way oriented case allows built gpu fan intake exhaust heat case would buy better air cooler cpu even basic tower coolerhttpspcpartpickercomproductvhh7yj stock cooler kinda suck louder need chassis airflow pointed would also way efficient downdraft cooler
thanks advice know detach stock cooler cpu replace another
cooler installed top cpu use aftermarket one like one linked included one part needed mount inside box
sweet thanks ton youve got recs motherboard feel free let know
nevermind checked link lol thanks much
total budget upgrade
gaming productivity content creation would help list software game use play additionally whats life expectancy build said upgrade end new build whats life expectancy
wouldnt budget number particularly say ideally less 1000 total maybe like 500 max looking kind see focus specifically

havent really eliminated psu problem established gpu good id eliminate thing still questionable id pull everything case breadboard part still doubt use adapter cable 4060ti possible cause received brand new psu ground power line reversed one pcie cable weird thing possible using riser card adapter connect gpu since 4060 ti work 3080 ti doesnt dont know could issue actually doesnt eliminate riser card cause youd need eliminate riser card see gpus exhibit behaviour regardless whether chain mean pulling motherboard plug gpus motherboard directly thats id havent eliminated psu issue either need one 8pin 4060ti two 3080ti could one bad 8pin cable modular perhaps one plugged incorrect port psu 2nd psu use check whole chain 3080ti directly installed motherboard connected either psu see difference dont native 12pin connector 3080ti going difficulty could bad adapter
tried solution plugged gpu directly mobo removed 12 pin adapter chain used 3 different 8 pin came psu previously worked 4060 ti well case highly doubt port psu bad 12 pin 8 pin know 8 pin worked 4060 ti matter port plugged still result mobo posting cpu fan spinning psu gpu fan video signal
2nd psu sub chain would way eliminate psu cause id also try resetting bios default

im leaning towards kind connection voltage issue specifically would try completely reseating gpu especially ever moved pc gpu would random shutdown pc shut randomly 100 time hasnt done year im fairly certain oversized gpu falling socket would also try stress testing individual component
1 aero cooler 1 cpu fan dont think issue temperature remain low 4060 cpu mobo depending im 70 gpu component new way test ram make sure causing instability
actually quiet 600w psu crash started bought msi one rule defective psu hypothesis ended returning 600w psu thought might well keep 850w one gpu issue also create dump never realised lack dump file indicated big issue thanks info guess seriously consider sending pc back examination
actually another psu crash started changed msi one change led undervoltage although admit professional using related app ive reseated component connector except cpu dont thermal paste hand guess try stress testing tried occt pc shuts within 13 minute test start
run memory test tool one listed herehttpsgithubcomintegralfxmemtesthelperblobocguideddr420oc20guidemdmemorytestingsoftware verify ram timing causing issue
would think gpu issue would really fence ram really dont know test ram next memtest x64 free beer let run hour know memory show dump memory bsod dump big question anyways downside memory testing cpu mobo still list nice thing cpu amd willing rma without problem look program called advanced rma lucky enough chat person phone net use word amd take cc place hold cost chip ship chip shipping label return return reverse first recieve new cpu ship old one back 2nd see old one arrive warehouse cancel cc hold seen vndors default offer occasionaly take stick poke prod give
doesnt occt stress test multiple component stress test individual component specific software
sorry late answer ive trying run test pc shuts soon start guess might serious issue cant even verify ram timing

easily replacable want quieter fine
stock fan louder aftermarkets always upgrade later
louder aftermarket fan thats breaking point buy one theyre like 20
best bang buck atm meant occasionally work program opposed working 40 hour week software go less otherwise productivity go way time spent productivity go way win win
sure dont experience software think 5600 5700 relatively similar 5700 little bit better thanks cores7800 7700 also relatively similar depends prioritize game performance work performance maybe try fibd benchmark adobe software plan use
good know thanks thought stock fan option even upgrade
option people play game hour time extra 35 even 20 towards aftermarket heatsink make system lot quieter people recommend use system surf web really isnt much difference
log using microsoft account instead pin
pin hardware locked old cpu would reinstall old cpu possibly mobo deactivate pin window hardware swap
nope wish could show photo wont let photo click internet restart power sleep accessibility stuff make pin button nothing else ive tried stuff like window l lock luck
there forgot pin option
sadly reset pc worked

think air cooling sufficient
come
yes decent case airflow 9800x3d air cooled fine 5090 generates lot heat make sure get heat case doesnt recirculate
better timing probably faster generally considered better dram stick also capable significant overclocking want dont cost selected
going 4 140mm 3 120mm intake 2 140mm 1 120mm exhaust positive pressure arctic p12s p14s
shit already ram stick would difference huge
long fan laid appropriately front back bottom top airflow thats plenty fan airflow much flow geometry number fan rather doubt need 7 intake perhaps run slowerquieter
huge difference thought asking general feedback build component
using slot suppose could leave 120 side 4 140mm intake bottom front 1 120mm rear exhaust 2 140mm exhaust top would good
sound like enough im familiar case understand achieve best airflow mesh side make airflow less obvious probably fine particularly exhaust fan top hottest air tends go overdoing positive pressure push cool air whatever mesh closest intake doesnt accomplish anything mesh side think want balance intake exhaust make sure youre exhausting hot air letting intake fan pump air nearby mesh without affecting hot air anyone experience case open mesh design offer thought fan intakeexhaust balance would good side intake directly feed cool air gpu intake certainly wouldnt hurt either would guarantee cool air going gpu cooler

okay thanks regarding psu 600 watt enough pc part picker seems think maximum load 160 watt 600

would go better gpu lot vram memory bus pretty narrow fastest chip ever new stuff nvidia amd right around corner stuff starting completely stock honestly kinda bad time right bet could snag last gen stuff used people upgrade newer gpus soon
would switch cooler something cheaper use saved money gpu could replace cpu ryzen 7 5700x3d

yeah im gon na buy piece individually time cause cant spend much im going save gpu last case find good deal 4070 something

wanted split o game drive bad idea also 2 drive current machine 1tb
looking cheaper board im worried discovering later using 2 m2 ssds affect gpus slot somehow apparently people complaining specific gigabyte board well dunno true dont wan na doubt thing like psu yeah 850w cheaper 50usd really worth annoyance seeing 4090 1000w recommended 100usd spent cable ill try find cheaper board maybe consolidate 4tb im going samsung probably price difference isnt worth doubt get microstutters something random requirement minimum im worried money scale
bad idea also partition 4tb drive whatever size want effectively work speed difference minimal
bad idea really necessary anymore use 2 4tb samsung ssds build recommend going different brand unless like really like samsung branding suggest swap wd black pure gaming pc even use ssd without dram like ud90
software development game time alright think ill combine 1 4tb
discontinued window 10 support mean pc stuck less secure window 10 cant upgrade window 11 motherboard sure cant upgrade another b550 model steel legend asrock using win 11 installed scratch upgrade remember correctly almost 2 year think 1080p 3080 3080ti waste money dont buy anything 6750xt maybe 7700xt6800 consider 308040705070 want upgrade screen 1440p higher getting 5700x3d current mb would give gaming perf 7700x would noticeably slower task since extra cache doesnt much use case beside gaming

forgot mention aorus b550 elite ax v2 think upgrade window 11 im sure
well b550 aorus elite ax v2 im sure keep useful data current ssds
thatd work nicely 5950x keep useful data current ssds plug play worst youll need set one boot drive bios
many case new bios support new hardware bug fixed useful always sometime new bios may broke something rollback needed work expected feel free leave current version escpecialy clue recover bricked failed update
ok many thanks
motherboard know used header previous build feel like thats right header rgbrelated header far im aware labelled argb rgb edit sorry seen name mobo posted okay didnt look first case posted didnt realise prebuilt cant find manual specific board im absolutely confident header correct one likely related case led g16chr youre definitely using wrong header
thanks im pretty sure youre right cant find 3 pin header free board im probably gon na get preem one appreciate confirming tbh bc thats exactly thinking

thank ill look dont know much cpu
impossible say without knowing game he playing high refresh rate cpu going bottleneck gpu especially esports game

cpu upgrade isnt going anything case youre gpulimited resolution want fps youre looking higher tier gpu try lowering graphic setting resolution

ahh yup nothing budget going push 240 fps basically double 1440p monitor

shouldnt issue rtx 2060 super rather stable card failure rate extremely low go like get anything useful 80bucks new
friend still run 970 doesnt seem issue also play old game depends entirely want play upgrade cant play thing want play setting resolution want afford people dont buy 5090 cause best buy cheapest thing want
depend game youll play stick 1080p dial back quality setting necessary turn dlssfsrxess dont see cant last another 5 year
still capable gpu long looking max latest aaa title
thats good deal id roll dice one
id say take 2080 tight budget least one burned mining
good 1080p wont able run many game highultra setting whether last another 45 year im sure id expect wouldnt count might able find used rx6600 100110 performance 3 year newer
would give friend card worth little worth price either way
thanks reply guy think ill set aside consider spending little bit rx 6600
f2p game youll fine believe indiana jones first game 2060 min spec
8gb super model haha
2060 super basically 2070
according bit faster httpsoverclock3dnetreviewsgpudisplaysamdradeonrx7800xtreview13httpsoverclock3dnetreviewsgpudisplaysamdradeonrx7800xtreview13
amd gpus horrible blender compared similar priced nvidia gpus generation 300 4060 one worst gpus nvidia ever made price performance perspective generally render twice fast 7800 xt cycle v 2060 though 7800xt bit faster 2060
mean pretty awful 500 card least ill gaming higher framerate would 4070 thanks couldnt find benchmark
get one 170 would go decent card older still good vram clock speed 1080 issue 1440 might give hard time though
there thing old work work save money need replace whole computer
6600xt like double performance 170 also good price
bought 100 5700xt coming 1650 super im older game old card fine use case struggling id say wait deal go afford upgrade real especially since youre coming slightly lesser card old one going slightly better one new one live like youre paying 2000 5090
reapply thermal paste want heat spreader completely covered buy thermal paste application tool really want perfect something ive ever used
series option budget would suggest getting console
shouldnt installing radeon graphic driver install nvidia geforce gpu driver ryzen chipset driver motherboard chipset cpu httpswwwamdcomenresourcessupportarticlesfaqschipsetinstallhtmlhttpswwwamdcomenresourcessupportarticlesfaqschipsetinstallhtml source ryzen 9 3950x nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
install youre going using igpu especially youre using hdmidp port motherboard disable igpu bios worry installing driver
wont able install gpu driver gpu dont system
cpu install chipset driver radeons gpu gaming driver creator one one proffesional use like editing stuff work well gaming also im two tho want game time edits like couple highlight
thought 7600x igpu
correct install ryzen chipset driver nvidia gpu driver use geforce game ready driver studio driver wont notice difference part
one going plugging monitor thats one need install driver typically one display driver installed theory actually use gpu igpu multimonitor setup two display driver installed practice asking issue doesnt gain anything except specific circumstance much better run everything dedicated gpu unless good reason otherwise
extra assurance rtx 5090 fastest consumer gpu planet set release later week first consumer device support pcie 50 x16 loos 3 performance worst case using pcie 30 v pcie 50 even less v using pcie 40 outside synthetic benchmark explicitly designed use much pcie bandwidth possible pcie 30 plenty fast

oh ok 30 lot headroom midrange gpus thanks
thanks
bottleneck mostly fud could grab 5070ti fine
thanks input
financial trouble want get something price bracket b580 best budget card atm great value
wait summer think finance better make decision 5070 reviewed youll able make informed choice
4070 super probably wont available sale retail market summer 2025 already production 5070 replacing next month one predict 5070 cost information available far msrp 549 fe
kind financial trouble youre choosing gpu paying bill theyre bad idea dont get anything unless need pc generate income
specific im going work trip month obv expense go bit time nothing crazy serious like going debt
thats true considering someone commented 4070 super probably wont available sale retail market summer 2025 since production 5070 replacing next month thats im worried since 5070 price probably go option 4070 super would make expensive overall
ok great didnt know based usage think go
set amount money aside work trip get back wonder price part go thats case might well buy something nothing serious paying bill putting food table etc
4070ti got like year ago id still take b580 advice price steal get youre playing game really looking getting 50 series card come going practically impossible anyway even money wasnt concern
5070 probably available msrp 4070 4070s throughout lifetime slightly faster 4070s wouldnt really worry market worse summer compared pretty much worst time buy rn since 40series card stopped produced 50series drop

sure worst
getting usb
youre creating boot medium correctly use tool microsofts site
downloading onto pc moving usb cant see option besides disc
b realised minute ago long day brain fried watching many yt vids build setup pc
isnt make bootable window drive either use microsoft medium creation tool set target usb drive use program like rufus use iso downloaded create need instruction google make bootable window usb drive
good ive found long day brain fried
take rest go back later getting frustrated lead problem
thats plan 1130pm rn ill finish getting driver window ready usb getting back tomorrow hopefully get running cheer help
gpu tentative im waiting 5090s release hopefully snag one otherwise mostly concerned whether return ram 6000mhz cl30 instead everything else already purchased stored away safely minus psu taking long time ship
full tower case would anyone want 2x2tb 4tb also gen5 nvme pointless drive u picked expansive af without good reason ram u picked amd expo psu u picked dont native 12vhpwr connector adapter 64gb completely pointless thing get u futureproofing anything going 64gb expansive mobo give u performance change would httpspcpartpickercomlisttwt22xhttpspcpartpickercomlisttwt22x 800 saved performance
dont need return ram would manually clock 6000 mt 3000 mhz cl30 instead 6400 cl32 6400 slower 6000 ryzen 9000 let overclock fclk fabric clock aka internal cpu bus 3200 mhz 11 ram dont believe ryzen 7000 allows itll drop fclk 1600 mhz use 6400 mt ram dont want deal yes return get 6000 cl30 return ram may want opt nonrgb ram front fan dual tower cooler like nhd15 completely hide ram extra tall ram like rgb also force front fan mounted quite high front cooler thats problem cooler even 7000d look little funny im also going warn noctua nhd15 inconsistent am5 cpu even offset mount need use may see extremely high temp even thermal throttling worst case nhd15 7800x3d may also get unlucky itll totally fine know start seeing extremely high temp cant figure might actually anything wrong cpu cooler get unlucky manufacturing tolerance two end extremely bad cooling performance exact cooler intel cpu likely perform amazingly like noctua cooler tend super cheap 16 single tower cooler may enough handle 7800x3d keeping cooler noctua nhd15 im saying bad case 35 thermalright phantom spirit 120 variant consistently match best nhd15 am5
got case free brand new friend lot space would amd expo make difference dont plan overclocking psu im pretty open minded changing mostly picked lot thing based brand ive good experience past readwrite speed sabrents looked better benchmark saw already sabrent 4 200 towards 5 amazon via gift card tuf580 plus motherboard ive quite time dont mind spending bit stay brand im familiar 64gb ram bc dual monitor setup usually youtube video one moddedaddon gameplay us good chunk memory
thanks look like could swap vengeance 6000mhz 30 cl price even save money get nonrgb spec didnt account ram height covered cooler also didnt know noctua compatibility issue am5 learn something new every day originally choose 30 cooler one friend said noctua way go higher quality cpu fell tdp rabbit hole
noctua cooler still highest quality cooler get excellent warranty customer service legitimately think noctua make best fan buy cheaper buy phantom spirit 120 swap fan noctua nfa12x25 chromax buy nhd15 get better cooling performance am5 even lower db thats even nhd15 using 140mm fan nfa15 give big advantage said new noctua nhd15 g2 lbc absolutely mop floor besting every air cooler market many 240 aios boot also cost 160 7800x3d also isnt power hungry cpu us half power fastest intel gaming cpu noctua cooler shine though even nhd15 struggle 14900k
id personally vote either 265k 12700k something like willing take risk 13th 14th gen
much love 5950x 265k upgrade path probably going faster am4 dead cpu socket am5 stuff r9 9900x almost price 265k seller upgrade path feel better option option lower power consumption mean run cooler 7900x also little cheaper problem read people issue intel ultra stuff wouldnt say defective certainly less case 14th gen stuff atm dont think could go wrong 265k got experience music production take grain salt read intel suppose better ryzen dont know thats still case
dont know total budget im sure 7700x 7900x would challenge purchased 278 378 respectively
also want add better cpu 400 please let know
7500f 7600 7600x 7700 7700x 9600x 9700x 300 perform well music production intel chip wont upgradable future likely generation motherboard
ryzen 9 7900x
total cost core ultra 265k generally lower amd equivalent particularly motherboard feature taken account always buy combo find unstable unusable use case return think lot early introduction kink worked though im sure multicore optimization window microcenter nearby 265k 300 get 70 z890 board ultimate difference platform cost likely going boil motherboard feature wantneed need tb4 intels going cheaper like 265k productivity ryzen 7 productivity benchmark tend favor always check review whatever software need run whether p e core get 20 core 265k
yeah degradation stuff scared 14700k intel say fixed idk trust
thanks reply ive read high core important music production efficiency core thing confusing ive read 265k essentially 14 core cpu cause efficiency core like 12 idk thank u clearing issue 265k though worried
9900x currently sale 400 think buy really quickly afford
say intel chip generation motherboard last time intel one generation motherboard fyi intels 12 13 14 gen cpu socketmotherboard 10 11 socket 6 7 8 9 socket
problem afaik music production really lvoes core amd lackluster department new core ultra series reportedly also issue think wan na safe 265k truly want norisk experience amd best choice pointed expensive compared intel
yeah mean 9900x 30 7900x decent deal clue long deal last want take advantage youd probably go ahead pull trigger though miss deal either 7000 series suggestion fine music production imo
httpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentscpusintelshipsnovalakecpustopartnersfortestingsamplesintendedforvalidationandresearch nova lake expected require new socket unless intel port panther lake desktop lga 1851 could one shortestlived platform intels history next gen intel ddr6 chip lga 1851 285k refresh based silicon get
yeah sure theyd think core ultra 2 series would chip made lga 1851 though fair run 2 generation socket awhile 6 7 interchangeable 8 9 although four generation technically lga 1151 6th 7th gen worked revision 1 8th 9th gen worked revision 2 effectively still 2 generation per socket
yeah confusing part whole efficiency core thing intel going dont even know well work daw
yeah checked benchmark stuff seems like 7900x 9900x lot similar thought ill probably wait day hopefully sale still around lol thanks insight though appreciate
article nova lake coming awhile would assume intel something end 2025 perhaps panther lake thats improves upon 200 desktop series
thats fair would expect socket stay cpu come usb5 pcie6 ddr6 add pcie lane none seem imminent besides intel much bigger thing fix topend gaming nothing thing lead changing socket plus think heat intel feeling amd would lead changing socket less often sell 265k285k buyer 385k motherboard make good upsell performance user much likely buy intel round amd game amd playing long word intel longer bully force user buy new motherboards often used
im 1060
still 1070
nvidia literally announced yesterday theyre going start phasing support gtx 1000 series driver update going stop soon still get one want great card launched eight year ago bear mind theyre abandoned altogether
actually snagged one 80 upgrade 980 ti im pretty dang happy far
1080 ti going strong
dont care ray tracing 1080ti still really good card 1080p
game starting require ray tracing card legend probably wouldnt get one unless play older game
much get rx6600rtx2060super theyre faster gtx 1080 support ray tracing wont issue upcoming game
1070 gtx intel i2500k upgraded 4k monitor soooo might upgrade pc soon
970 im considering update
hey reasonable something lot people tend forget buy need look cool 1080 performance need bother paying around 100 could also get used 2060 performs better also use dlss mention less powerdraw save money electricity
id always suggest spending extra get anything newer 10 series rx 500 get amd 6600 like 160 3060 bit
keep evga 1080ti finish recent upgrade build deserves enshrined see still going strong 8 year
system 1080 gtx run 1440 4k problem modest upgrade see improvement
running 970
gtx 770 lol
im still using 1050 ti
im using 980ti still solid card
im still 1070 mobile first ive heard someone using even older tech still dont know ray tracing haha
1080ti still holding total beast card 2k capped 60 fps sp game television 1080p mouse keyboard mp game although prob upgrade 4070ti later year
1080ti ftw3
might put one workstation 2700x build either old shitty quadro
still 1070 havent issue playing game want play
2070 super still beast pair well 5700x ryzen
also gtx 1080 dont time play much 23 year hope time id go something open driver order go gaming linux free window dont care competitive multiplayer least 16gb vram bit future proof support ray tracing like make game look would probably intel arc amd radeon
1080 ran tarkov 1440p upgraded future indiana jones grayzone warfare showing u coming good new game still dude monster card
gtx 1080 since 2016 work good still playing 1440p monitor hold well tweak graphic setting im usually around medium modern game whenever eventually build new computer going frame gpu hang wall guy warrior good almost 10 year deserves ceremonious retirement
ive got bunch friend running 1080s 1080tis htpcs plugged 4k120 tv play controller game issue totally ok gpu considering youre running 1080p 1440p monitor expect 100fps game
im using 1070
1070 fe bought used 2020 thinking jumping 3080 since price seem around 300usd
go buy 1080 buy 400 build stick 970 every game youre currently playing perform better see need get new gpu
im 660
right work great 1440p doom eternal baldurs gate 3 civilization vi fallout 4 course handle great nonaaa title make new build though cant swap 970 1080
id advise simple reason lack dlss try pick used 2080ti 3080 maybe dlss especially new transformer model black magic must feature day imo
rx480 babbyyy
im 1050 ti haha
2080 moment expensive id say get instead even 3070 maybe upgrading may well look option red team card may better 1080 price
really stupid idea buy 10series right want play anything esports
would buy 1080 built brand new pc latest part x870e 9800x3d etc holding 50 series card kept 1080 dont know driver issue couldnt get boot screen access bios without plugging separately motherboards hdmi port desktop could switch 1080 port ended getting 4070 sale black friday dont issue think 10 series way old point find one arc b580 really solid budget card
still using 1080 ti showing age come certain game id love upgrade give aging pc kid gesture around cost everything day said game like wow fortnite obviously indie game run well enough
point arc a370m basically 1050
daily water cooled 1080ti ryzen 3400g pretty good igpu whole build cost less 400 run everything want high 1440p ultra 1080 highly recommend lossless scaling though game really dont like ive also dual boot linux mint window 11 dont notice performance difference either extra cash id definitely get 6700xt 2080 since get hardware ray tracing power efficiency theyre twice price used 1080ti dont plan upgrading another 3 4 year tbh
im 980 ti build dad gave
im camp recommends buying used watch ebay 150 cpumobo combo set new ram m2 ssd run 1080ti main machine 1070 one kid 5600xt others
use titan x pascal essentially 1080 ti rig keep basement perfect moonlight streaming handheld
still 1060 htpc work fine im bit cheapskate always year behind curve right working fine eldenring cyberpunk 1080p
upgraded 2060 want chance playing newest game honestly forced ray tracing may future dont like loved never real problem like 95 percent game id play
would absolutely try push even earliest rtx series stuff something like 2060s yes expensive hardware rt dlss give exponentially wiggle room play game compared 1080
1070ti month ago upgraded 4080 super difference insane lol
desktop run gtx1050ti 8gbs ram i3
last month using 1080 got 4060 literally difference performance maybe 1020 frame higher everything else exact work like charm age struggle shaders game overall pretty decent mine upgrade 950 970 budget upgrade id say 1080 good pick
going legacy status soon cut cuda support apps
gtx eliminated year like win10 although two game forcing dx122 think starting year aaa game use function dx12u even gtx run performance reduced find minimum configuration many aaa game reached 1070 even 2060 1080 soon lose competitiveness course many game indiana jones ff7rebirth dont care game choose 1080
possible try get used rtx 20603050 8gb dlss newer game use ray tracing default unless strictly play older game
watched linus video said new intel card 250 good replacement maybe something look
1080 14700kf aint problem new indiana jones game requires rtx run fine
still rocking final 1070ti
great 2nd gpu mb support one pas vm run graphical application vm better performance
see 1080 still great choice people play slightly older game interested ray tracing
build 2018 1080 ti im heavily thinking upgrading 5070 come there game drop single digit fps even lowest setting dont know solely graphic card would concern
used 1070 launch time last year 4070s launched held fort long time finally upgraded newer card utterly awesome power hike considerable youll definitely notice
gtx 1070 work fine aram
using gtx 1070 last month still decent gpu unless want ultra 25k resolution
cpu overhead thing upgrading better gpu 970 1080 fine 10 year old processor definitely handle new 50 series intel battlemage getting spanked review testing budget upgrade friendly high cpu usage
1080 fullhd run everything game make choose high graphic presets 60 fps one important thing every component pc near toptier 400 build may problem cpu hit limit 100 load gpu 2040 may easily make game unplayable carefull dont spare cpu 1080 still strong
still running 1080 debating getting cp2077 playing card think
dude 1070ti rig ama

asus cerberus gtx 1070ti intel i78700 32 gb ddr4 ram pc 7 year old could run war thunder max setting 200 fps lower setting 60 90 fps lag time im bit surprised others similar card theyre holding better
nvidia literally announced yesterday theyre going start phasing support gtx 1000 series literally didnt phasing support cuda game ready driver read article headline
crucial piece information far write
980ti taking care thing year year time ever bought top end card little guy disappoint till 2021 found 2080 used song
7 going 8 year 1080 1440p rtx gsync 4550 fps dip great
1080ti starting struggle bit vr 1440p 144hz
used 1070ti broke went got 6700xt instead
yea 1080ti still play game steam library would like upgrade someday latest nvidia card cost much whole computer hard justify spending two grand video card even afford
may care rt rt care become exponentially common hard requirement every passing year
play 3440x1440p100fps 4k60fps 1080ti older game low medium setting mind
like 2 aaa game yeah really
got rx6600 recently 110 agree thats probably far back want go cheap gpu
2060 doesnt outperform 1080 benchmark find
mean ton people still 1050 laptop
brand new go 4070 ti super place price even cheaper stock
used 2080 card priced kinda bad ton used 3080 card willing pay 300 ebay auction unfortunately largely bot jacking price though gave
everything listed 3x price think op looking cheaper upgrade prob casual gamer nothing triple new release
2080 like 2x expensive 3070 25 time 3x rx 5700xt little better 100 slightly better
recommend old used tech work work
came new rig 4070 super huuuuge jump 1060 6g holding 1080p fact think old mobo tapped top end ddr3 ram bottleneck
seconding 1060 6gb still going strong im getting replaced due full system overhaul decided treat many component approaching 10 year age want see current tech offer
sold mine 2021 paid 2017
dont get 4k always feel need upgrade go good 1440p screen anything
dont think 5060 ever near enough play 4k
5060 4k pair well would think 1440p would better match
honestly 3700x carried far chip put work even paired 7900xtx bought early 2020 6 month ish released last component upgraded max am4 build absolutely solid cpu 1080 even light 1440 gaming
built cheap pc used 3600 used 5700 xt way better 1600af 1650 super even hardly pushed limit dont play game intensive part though thats also choice make dont need 4070 fortnite counter strike mostly play couple tycoon sim game occasional story mode game made past 1015 year system good enough lot fun around 330 expensive okay already 1tb nvme laying around drawer many part people say arent good enough anymore enough almost 99 game produced past decade includes game come recently
buy really good 1440p instead doesnt get really much better 4k imho
combo mind numbingly stupid lol
aaayy twinsy went mini atx atx swapped intel amd everything gpu replaced ha
yeah incredible love generation card also really old intel great incredible computer 8 year old
havent bothered overclocking 6700k chance theyre pretty good buddy run 5ghz 2060 super still solid
case im confident say good ol time
thank god thought precious gpu done
like every technology since invention computer
assume play newer game
mean 100 buck card get point hell able get raytracing card cheap
mean point 2 aaa game required dx11 well 2 aaa game required hardware transform lighting 2 aaa game required hardware 3d acceleration thing always move yeah advanement lot slower still happens gtx 1080 8 year old getting gpu one generation newer save lot headache
metro exodus ee avatar outlaw indiana jones spiderman 2 doom da starting
even aa title even indie game soon step dx12 ultimate everything older rx 6000 arc rtx 20 series obsolete cant play game
dont forget mesh shading
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvckcrdqqrjwhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvckcrdqqrjw literally first one googled plus dlss want 1080 anyways

agreed 4k really belongs highend graphic card would like think day wouldnt case unfortunately game graphic become much demanding shittier shittier optimization requiring modern beefy graphic cope
27 1440 really nice sweet spot
4090 still game 3440x1440 monitor 4k many game still tax gpu youre trying hit 165 fps
3700x 6900xt handle 4k absolutely fine
5060 isnt even announced yet dont know probably thing know 8 vram card doubt
course aaa title switch level graphic doable 4k
build 2070 super 3700x gpu died put new 4070 super 3700x still fine 1440p ultra 8090 fps obviously aint getting 500 fps counterstrike tho lol
perhaps dont game yeah indeed gaming rig priority backwards
using rx 570 similar performance 1060 ryzen 9 5950x almost two year finally upgraded gpu rx 7900 gre use machine wasnt primarily gaming combo worked great every machine purposebuilt gaming
actually make sense theyre playing thing like wow gw2 cache wonder mmos
already point already get rt card cheap thats entirely point
exactly need look pc part satisfying need investment future use well op might content playing roller coaster tycoon 2 might tempted pick absolute must game 2026 next year op need evaluate immediate want well speculate future want
get feeling op interested many newer title given current hardware 1080p admission
metro exodus play normal one
avatar sw outlaw dont require rt metro exodus rt version spiderman 2 hasnt released yet prediction saying wont require either indiana jones new doom require list
yup got 4k 240hz oled kind regret wish got 1440p 360hz oled instead used 4k tv 4k single player game use always lower resolution higher frame competitive game
went 1050 getting 30 fps game 1080p completely happy time 4k 60fps 4080 eventually get 4k high framerate oled likely like two year due monetary commitment
yeah surprise 4k gpu play 4k lol meanwhile itll interesting see 5060 mine money able due vram limit
dont game 9800x3d massive waste money thing 3d v cache noticeably better performance game workload 9900x 9950x would better performance
get 500700 fps league legend setup maxed setting
person probably like playing sc2 blue moon
ryzen 9 5950x every machine purposebuilt gaming well youre using cpu purpose built gaming like x3d chip honestly 5950x would probably get better performance 9800x3d work station program core far important faster cache workload main goal isnt gaming wouldve better saving 100 getting 9900x would almost definitely better performance 9800x3d nongaming workload
wow 9800x3d gtx 1070 im getting consistent 150 fps 710 setting even main city big dungeon pack waiting rtx 5070 likely snatch one pure mmo gaming giga graphic card really pointless
pc part investment though
may may important ability actually choose want play upgrade outright scratched
gpu
thats really obtuse way reading wrote he talking investment term earning money planning around long term use system buying nonrtx card 2025 shortsighted four generation card version rtx could literally spend 150 2070 super bit better rtx getting 1080 100 isnt worth
id rather buy something thatll last 5 year forced upgrade 2 cheaped get work today
idk gpu running choice make went 4k oled monitor 4080 push monitor well enough opinion obviously poorly optimized game need adjustment dlss etc think im going hang onto 4080 another gen 5000 series 5070ti higher well opinion pro 4k 32 outweigh benefit 1440p high refresh rate opinion dont think id go route anything less 4080
4090
50 series looking like ray tracing ai upgrade base raster look 40 series hopefully leak wrong
4070ti super agree pro 4k 32 outweigh benefit 1440p 27 higher frame rate im competitive gaming using dlss play game 4k near max setting consistent fps 60 ive messing around forza horizon 5 recently dlss set quality near max setting im getting 100 fps game look gorgeous also photo editing 4k 32 much nicer 1440p 27 viewing editing photo
spatial audio stereo headphone dont get deceived marketing bullshit promising 71 pair stereo headphone possible get something like beyerdynamic dt990 pro external headphone amp satisfied
switched steelseries gamebuds far loving play r6 siege r6 eq tell footstep coming
thank ill give look didnt know call making sure im playing fps hear way
thank im steel series fan ill check
get 4090 youve tested system stable 1300 go run benchmark run modern aaa game tax card like tlou part 1 stalker 2 cyberpunk alan wake good hour crank setting max power connector safe make sure fully inserted try bend much around inserted havent issue took precaution dont know prevalent actually
mh gpu 2 year old receipt might part batch connector problem good point cable faulty socket slightly buy new one cheap sure wont melting whats called idk hell let test hour lol test would run particular benchmarking gpu thanks
cable necessarily bad people arent plugging way seated properly bending much case wide enough best avoid excessive bending honest wouldnt buy card couldnt torture test 60 minute using game choosing period
wait gpu market settle bit 50 series released price gpus may decrease ina month 50 series get distributed
save buy stuff least component minimally functional pc cpu igp else gpu cooler doesnt come one board ram storage psu needed peripheral want able test thing within return window
think might find help rbuildapcforme
pc im selling 3090 11700k 32 gb ram 1300
good deal
youre budget get 12400f since youre going need buy new motherboard likely ram well plus oc 12400f buy motherboard allows overclocking match beat 14400f anyways watchhttpsyoutubel7lcmoxaucasimavpynz9mgtozh01
neither mobo support best socket intel core i99900k thats silly purchase get decent b650 board amd ryzen 5 7600 look intel platform want reuse ddr4
12400f better pick saying 14400f future proof saying paid much begin time 12400f isnt good enough 14400f also good enough
shouldve mentioned post im planning buying b760 support 12th 14th gen
wouldnt even bother much risk reward find psu thats compatible component new used
thats really bad idea
httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html
yea table seems like 6950 better many comparison youtube say 3090 better im confused

always used logitech mouse going back 25 year theyre always good keyboard massive rabbit hole like keychrons numerous quality brand every price point
hey man thats lot razer gear feel software bloat like theyre trying control whole vibe lmao checked logitech solid stuff macro button extra feature software isnt wild plus need rgb flashiness youre vibing minimalist psychic aesthetic right
best part synapse 4 removed ability tell update bother popups stupid crap
id definitely dive deeper enthusiast subreddits want get best best subreddits like rmousereview rmechanicalkeyboards rheadphones really dig subcategory tend better getting big brand cover everything sorta well far keyboard go custom one use qmk extremely programmable let set macro pretty much everything
second response ive seen mentioning logitech look like ill check product thing thats causing abrasion far semilack wireless product biggie really
terrible isnt lmao definitely fell fallacy thinking thing would better stuck razer brand im drowning constant update software bug overall issue brand whole ill definitely check logitechs option cant say ive put true effort researching whole ill see dig
oh man thing gotten awful first downloaded year ago excited awesome controlling thing hub setting macro one spot excuse peddle platform reward system advertise new product cause problem pc seems lol needless say im hellbent swapping dont plan going back
ton wireless stuff using wireless g502 lightspeed several year also dont use peripheral software issue g502 onboard memory program uninstall logitech software
ive using logitech stuff using software day ran app one time customize mouse setting save onboard memory shut autostart seem hell bent data collection ad face popup notification daily update generally annoying end user much possible
5700x3d used 6900xt30906950xt new 850w psu like pure power 12w
unless really need upgrade psu working would keep give budget gpu especially since dont care aesthetic fancy stuff think 600w plelnty budget get latest greatest place price go would take 5700x3d aliexpress around 200 gaming youre 100w max probably mostly around 70 leaf lot budget money power wise get 5070 5070ti depending price budget think even 5070ti fine power wise 600w psu cpu 300350w 100w cpu leaf plenty leeway still oc gpu shave 50watt loss performance ofc 4070 super new psu still great option would better value getting 5700x3d dropping thats left money gpu
x3ds virtually non existent online store canada rn tell could get 5800xt though 280 would sufficient
assume mean 5800x check aliexpress least seller ship 5700x3d canada stay away listing without review
ali express youre going get x3d version stick 3600x till upgrade motherboard jump 3600x 5800x nice worth 300cad jump x3d chip price definitely
sick build youve got id say youre good go 7900 xtx youre looking save cash maybe swap cpu ryzen 5 5600 use stock cooler bit free fund without sacrificing much performance also check wd blue sn570 storage bit cheaper still get job done could also try slightly less expensive case like phanteks p300a small change could give extra cash play even put towards rgb lighting level build aura let u know go decide
debug light mb light showing
give quick yellow flash get quick red flash another section motherboard couldnt find manual
label underaround light last light see probably indicating step failing could worth seeing thats
got home reviewed footage motherboard yellow light flashed minute turned said cpu red light flashed minute cover say adrus series cant remove im sure
update took ram entirely booted guess faulty stick since tried reseated multiple time multiple different slot
guess make sure there bent pin cpu socket reset cmos actually im thinking try different ram configuration havent swapped might shorted whatever theyre dead try 1 stick dimm slot preferably completely different ram best buy return pretty lenient
swapped ram new ram new ram completely different ram kit like different brand speed etc new version kit using
post part list
im encountering problem ill probably taking ram cpu repair shop tomorrow test different mobo ill let know outcome imin meantime anyone idea else problem could id appreciate
slightly different serial yes brand speed etc
z790 gaming plus wifi motherboard i9 14900 kf processor 2 stick 32 gb corsair vengeance 6000
great motherboard cpu could let know would helpful
get completely different brand ram kit try yellow dram light issue ram kit 99 time id try trying switch cpu mobo definitely dont think cpu though light would different color
nope asus b650 plus wifi ryzen 5 7600x3d
ok good know read online something board needed bios update work 14th gen think ive done would cause yellow dram light hadnt
going 1440p 1080p definitely noticeable especially 27 screen youll lose sharpness detail 180hz buttery smooth two monitor discord whatever super handy final decisin depend value youre graphic snob stick 1440p prioritize smoothness multitasking try 1080p setup
144180 huge difference 144240 depends priority like comment said
""
like 1440p monitor keep buy cheap 60 hz secondary monitor later need multi tasking need high framerates discordvideo
thx comment buy 1 60100 hz 1080p 1 240hz 1080p would worth
thats right maybe would buy 100hz 240hz
need good cpu hit 180hz lot game competitive game fine wont getting 180 triple game unless top 5 fastest cpu
look solid game ip screen great oled even better color worse refresh rate possibility burn va better hz rate easily curable bit worse color cheap one ghosting play online shooter higher fps kinda recommended wouldnt waste budget screen
am5 mean new mobo mem p
yep ill get everything new aside maybe ssd case everything fit gpu cpu hardest choice rest handle thanks
depends laptop performance 1440p 1080p frame
msi g27c4 e2 27in monitor would fine
sure price compare country county thats 150 usd
hey sorry im shockingly shit pc stuff 1080p 144hz
ok id say msi monitor even go oled shouldnt spending 300 long meet spec
thanks much

doesnt really matter really want even partition drive two unit ie 500gb 15tb system see two different drive dont personally see much value folk like keep stuff separate
already looked 150 12400f discount 76
12600kf almost certainly power limited h610 board event op make mistake choosing h610 board dont disagree way better cpu op trying skimp money id hate pay extra 20 12600kf choose h610 board find limited base pcore clockspeed 36ghz 12600kf additional draw ecores rather full 44ghz 12400f

difference price almost double
httpsamzneud36cwiam found price h610 problem
price weird
nope decent board best ever certainly better h610 board vrms probably good enough go 12700k13600k ever want
dont need expensive processor paired 70 series video card spend less processor video card opinion know people trashing intel get intel part much cheaper amd counterpart lose basically nothing performance building today id get 14700k intel bundle microcenter pair 5090 4090 one found affordably 4090 already httpswwwmicrocentercomsitecontentintelbundleandsaveaspx httpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare5723vs6344intelcorei714700kfvsamdryzen79800x3d 499 steal bundle nobody like intel know youre going thats fine great setup 5070ti decent 1440p card sure could shave cash cheaper cpu cooler httpswwwamazoncomgpproductb09vh1t1c2 everything else look great
said im new dont really preference toward amd intel work cheaper without losing much im sold
think worth spending extra 100 buck 599 bundle
14900k harder cool wont really give significant boost gaming whatsoever especially resolution 1440p higher anything motherboard upgrade would better choice 549 clicking build add component get microcenter also amd bundle microcenter also dont offer value given intel stuff cheaper nobody want option also 9800x3d fantastic processor 14700k also cost 250 less httpswwwmicrocentercomsitecontentbundleandsaveaspx

economy scale dont sell many white part production cost individual unit higher plus people must white part willing pay premium theyll charge premium
many people want manufacturer dont make many make relatively scarce allows retailer charge
apart economy scale white complex make need add thing plastic avoid staining result manufacturing step even slightly heavier additional factor
there become genuine market differentiator white black pc part weirdly enough seems though certain enthusiast adore full white build regardless cost combine aforementioned factor commentors economy scale many buying product youll start understand there small niche user would pay anything full black rbg build likewise white trend rbg styling particular time time there huge mass user seeking equivalent product lowest price retailersmanufacturers identified biggest customer term white pc part willing pay privilegeprestige due perceived limit availability dont forget white vogue black alternative color trend differentiate throughout 2000s trend understand group whole pay
ah man remember beige cheap option black part cost premium
personally ive wondered anyone would even want white computer
racism
there logisitical cost economy scale black part manufactured shipped huge number mean distributor benefit favorable bulk shipping deal fewer white part produced itll cost ship store

racism
called white tax reason
reason black fridge microwave expensive theyre made less quantity
isnt direct answer question think interesting parallel may shed light color cost white also historically one complicated expensive get right 11 year ago razer changed color usb port green match branding cost almost 400 thousand dollar httpswwwextremetechcomgaming178445380000thepricerazerpaidforagreenusbportonthenewbladelaptop

might dumb question white part better temperature black part
make small number white part premium part since premium expensive
white thing appear bigger
think charge white people buy like car manufacturer charge certain color even exotic color color shifting metallic paint
basic supply demand white part little niche there much demand counter tend sell higher price there similar thing car manufacturer paint isnt white silver black
imagine good ol supply demand
apple started trend
black neutral color fit everything
lot comment point economics personally think human psychology attract light reflection
kind annoying spend money piece equipment white instead black youre paying extra money frivolous superficial cosmetic youre annoyed extra cost buy black instead assume youre probably spending extra couple hundred bunch rgb heh good pc function form could bought 5070ti instead 5070 blew ti money bunch white part rgb id regret decision every single time scale back graphic setting fps noticeably dip also rgb annoys something would interested first place like say like cost extra
found opposite building productivity desktop computer closed case didnt care color anything white dram white cooler cheaper black one bought white one figured misestimated demand white part extra inventory probably usual situation
historically accurate

people rightfully pointing economy scale supplydemand omitting black plastic easier produce white much harder manufacture due stricter tolerance getting white pigment right difficult tell difference two black plastic white plastic harder balance pigment yellowing heat turning magenta time

also think quality control difficult expensive various black object black extremely similar difference shade white always feel like stick said intuition reference anything justify
also popular build color last year demand higher supply lower seller charge
cost produce product different color
additionally white plastic part tend discolor time heat light making dye necessary long term color stability expensive
make relatively scarce allows retailer charge msrp white part generally higher retailer making decision manufacturer
wish medium gray common
there small niche user would pay anything full black rbg build one user also care much noise considered noctua cooler fan even though chromax black version cost ultimately decided go quiet cheaper looking black close enough noctua performance pointing even black expensive color color get produced less
contrarian deep psychological response seeing computer build constant color combination involving black personally dont understand build people put toy inside machine spent past 15 year fighting manufacturer proper airflow case people filling funko pop anime figure flower pick

youre making 90 production black make 10 white cost produce sell white plastic also prone discolouration iirc may need different additive plastic used
two different product
doesnt like get better deal per unit buy bulk grocery store company get better rate unit even matter paint job would still need pay per unit paint labor remotely close premium someone else said people want full white willing pay
may need different mold textured surface black look horrible white
two different process make yes product making thing basically different product dont make black case paint white vice versa cant make black white case assembly line time white case use different ingredient produce white case ingredient white case might expensive ingredient black case since black defacto default case color color expensive
think build entirely different paint booth white case painting done machine dude rattle can
color manufacturing actually complicated usually expensive thing isnt easy buying dye telling machine make thing white time watched video oneplus phone manufacturing long time ago went detail process cost associated producing different color dont remember video detail make understand product dont always come variety color
also look journey seems like youre interested white component willing pay aesthetic part maker betting theyve proven right often
innocent little one yoda
one really answered give half answer black usually done black zinc plating multiple common manufacturing process get black finish product white im really sure white plating assume must sort painting process sure deal white black common cheaper process done frequently
cost associated need either build another line make white part b pause production black change white think manufacturer b make sense far cost go
try looking actual term economy scale little reading itll help understand
white paint sometimes use titanium pigment titanium cheap

look lightcolored case 90 early 2000s mismatched panel significant yellowing
goodol window 98 piss yellow look

decorative still decent airflow
yup people forget original white iphone 4 actually bit yellow white annoying shade get right
invalid black see named differently already use different mold white also different mold separate production line like differently named black card expensive due specific type heating mold prevent discoloration make sense
expect youd probably also make white model beginning production run whilst everything still relatively clean might even one production run white model happens art supply eg pencil paint pastel manufacturing work light dark clean everything thoroughly start mean may month particular colour made even gone stock
yes undoubtedly settled point least generally even lifespan though theyve aged year often apple insane rd budget nearly infinite resource pc part manufacturer substantially less
lower volume help either less white part change something add eventually price
thats good point figured would separate run color
good
yes good
get corsair rmx seasonic
sure thatll run got 850 running like 4 year
good expect fan noise coil whine
rme bad

game arent using integrated graphic 5600 make sure set 6600 dont tell game youre using plug right port suresure dont hdmidp cable plugged mobo instead video card sound like game setting performance according 6600 youre getting level performance expected igpu 5600g
1 hdmidisplay cable plugged gpu motherboard 2 gpu driver date
factory reset software build yes hdmi still plugged gpu even checked
yes hdmi plugging gpu driver date
missed part 98 ram utilization id start sure whats memory utilization like sitting idle like desktop
mean mismatch case front panel mobo internal there always mobo rear panel better usb port
find cheaper 7800x3d go difference low go 9800x3d
9800x3d would best chip compared two 7800x3d capable depends want fork extra cash latest greatest get either 7800x3d 9800x3d cpu forced upgrade mobo ram time
course newer chip better isnt popular mainly extremely scarce bad chip
micro center different 150 believe
micro center 3 piece
507080 fe
existing xmp work assuming speed timing stable board
corsair vengeance 32gb kit cl 30 6000mhz
perfect xmp version work fine
monitor probably fine however would caution 1440p increasingly problem 3070ti depending type game like play want play lot pretty aaa type game 8gb vram capacity 3070ti get maxed 1440p cause issue needing lower setting else use upscaling typically play less demanding game though probably much issue
solid advice thank plan playing monster hunter wild cyberpunk 2077 etc would would demanding game think sound like get lucky enough get 5070ti focus upgrading monitor
think sound smart plus arent hurry upgrade anyway always nice see new card launch actually get see real benchmark purchase stuff dont want put position unhappy build feel pressured immediately upgrade without full picture also might able snap older card 1440p capable current gen launch
thank definitely wait go appreciate help
really depends preference 800bucks wont able build better build new cpu pc overall better gaming gpu weaker storage access game use pc school work whatever always upgrade want play new gta 6 stick ps5 pro nobody know rockstar release version pc
also 2tb samsung 990 pro
mean money wise probably worth yeah youll likely get worse gaming performance
4060 ti 8gb 16gb version detail pretty important since lot new game using 8gb vram especially higher resolution sometimes even 1080p normally dont recommend lower 4070 current lineup going get 4060 ti pretty important get 16gb version want play new game older game indie game emulator even lighter new game sure 8gb fine heavier stuff really want 16gb 12gb probably would enough layout 128 bit bus 8 16gb get say doesnt enough bandwidth use dont know theyre talking always better memory need even fastest memory thing applies ram need 128gb work better run slower speed 32gb super fast memory
ps5 real use better alternative 5 generation fluke 3 exclusive 1 remake 1 spinoff 1 serious game nothing ps5 better pc least ps4 load exclusive time
op stick ps5 purely want use gaming play latest game without worry need pc stuff like work school personal thing get pc
perfectly running system getting good deal
really depends personal need obviously pc performant wont last nowhere near long ps5 pc gaming youll game wan na play available ps5 probably good idea switch
""
hmmmm unless want pc pc thing well probably wouldnt id save year
get pc great value time ascend brother
would youll lose access ps5 game trade worth imo youll also probably wait specific pc port like took year pc got god war ragnorok upside much larger library game live service sub even pc exclusive title well
would keep ps5 game optimized make comparing spec less relevant
good trade difference always get new gpu even 9800x3d day lot good potential grow build youre willing take effort
""
hmmm yes depends want ill post thought obviously subjective etc 4060 ti best definitely complete slouch youll need upgrade want game 4k perform ok 1440p ryzen 5 7600 little tinkering made perform good 7600 x version ive seen performs better 5700x3d chip am4 even though cheaper cpu still much fine cpu plenty room upgrade need 4k youd better 7800x3d imo thats say 7600 wont job b650 motherboard pcie 50 remember correctly difference 3040 average 13 performance loss trend follow shouldnt matter much thought id point 32gb ram presumably 6000mhz great gaming moving forward 16gb get chewed depending game day good prepared cl30 cl36 cl36 expect small performance loss psu 650w well think definitely need upgraded wont able much xx60xx70 card wont enough juice good deal wanting pc better experience 4k one potential youll need lot work get upgrading selling etc 10801440p gaming pc think youd fine
reason keeping ps5 pro gta vi exclusive better gaming performance right less likely annoying issue reason applies youre nontechnical person reason trading pc stuff workschoolcreativity later upgrade better gpu keep everything else instead buy entirely new system cpu strong enough accommodate even 4080 imo pc game cost lot less especially get game theyre brandnew might biggest reason tbh
gaming performance going better ps5 pro however cant shit console besides youtubenetflix
yes would
weird build bit place otherwise definitely cost powerful ps5
thats certainly worth
wouldnt ps5 exclusive p vr id save also build pc later pa5 worth psn gran turismo there lot good game psn put 4tb m2 mine
want get pc gaming good deal
edit yes
anything agaisnt ps5 exvelent plus youre getting beast gpu lol use pc gaming study learn new skill direction planet going show thing get tougher tougher
getting ripped lmao
definitely accurate
still og ps5 ill use gta 6 gpu doesnt need good 1440p 144fps
gpu weak im still using 2070 damn good job still recently ordered new board cpu memory ill keep 2070 long time still
way hell id say gaming performance would equal slightly better also get nvidia dlss frame gen op want use also pc obviously much gaming id take deal day long everything worked fine
8gb upgrade gpu whole pc year maybe 5070 ti
also mod pc massive plus
dont need 4k monitor 1440p 144hz
whats weird
nvm storage make difference
two ps5s
yes gpu weak compared ps5 pro top ps5 pro pssr game also optimized specific hardware ps5 ps5 pro pc builder tried build better pc price really possible jayztwocents httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7wj2lzprlfshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv7wj2lzprlfs linus httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvt4xaqgwpo10httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvt4xaqgwpo10
ps5 pssr game alot optimized ltt tried beat ps5 pro dollar dollar used 7800xt believe ps5 still better visuals performance yeah pc sure
ps5 around 7700xt level definitely weaker
everythings overpowered gpu mid parang nagoverspend everywhere else tapos nauubusan ng budget sa gpu
ye got really good deal launch pro
wow thats surprising considering expensive gpus dont doubt ps5 truly amazing smooth incredible look u pc user ripped big time sony cheap
damn thats insane im gon na go watch video looked online saw hardware equivalent ps5 pro rx 6800 3700x would say ps5 may run better dont graphic cranked max like lot pc game pc game give user option graphic fidelity console let choose performance quality mode even quality mode tends less fidelity pc high setting especially fine detail
7700xt isnt much better 4060 ti though would say though thats case depends op want pc op purely gaming stick ps5 pro op want stuff pc like work school personal project etc definitely pc
sony sell hardware zero profit loss make money game psn accessory
yeah finer control graphic setting big perk pc gaming
3090 price good thats dlss4wil added
go 50 series mfg awesome
tough choice thought 5080 actually going launch msrp id definitely tell get 7900xtx 900 isnt terrible price either 5070ti would also great option think youd much happier nvidias featureset including improved raytracing dlss frame generation really good think spending extra 300 get 5080 youre already spending 900 worth cant see spending much money card get raw rasterization tflops amd implementation fsr given ive seen nvidia late dlss4 good really good
hard say happen 5070 class card 9070s amd honestly personally going hold breath since generation seems pretty lackluster around one advantage 50 series seems multiframegen mainly play shooter think input lag introduced would probably frustrating think 7900xtx probably best current option cant predict future good value unreleased card especially 9070s since dont lot confirmed detail yet
4070 huge upgrade compared 3070
ive used switched tldr get used whatever stop noticing either curve lack one like curve ultrawides though
built new system spending nearly 5 year gaming laptop also 4080 choose odyssey g9 49 jarring first somehow disorienting using wide screen moving around also stunning experience able look left right getting view side screen feel much immersive play game like fortnite star citizen nm ffxiv also op give amd 7800x3dor 9800x3d look simply better intel cpu gaming actually lot better game love extra cache pc run much cooler recent generation intel chip lot problem
whatever monitor get try make sure oled even flat screen mmos much wow stuff like ash creation story game like wu kong blow mind super powering oled also reason youre going intel i9 ryzen 9800x3d
oled better investment personally hate curved doesnt work desk 2nd screen
completely personal preference hate one best friend love
really preference people like curved screen others dont actual technical reason display manufacturer went curved screen va display color shifting whenever viewed angle manufacturer started making large 32inch screen ultrawide screen would issue bad viewing angle side display even viewing monitor headon curved screen order keep viewing angle consistent user saw manufacturer started selling massive display sold like samsung asus several year ago bandaid flaw va type panel today though seems like marketing checkmark order get gamer crowd especially doesnt make sense oled since oled doesnt viewing angle problem 32inch ktc va monitor 1000r curve higher r number mean there less curve lower number mean deeper curve make sense monitor curved va panel even go really side order see color brightness shifting problem think monitor would fine flat panel honestly go monitor fit requirement budget
really personal preference triple curved monitor setup superwides infancy great support able go merged setup racing game flight sims space game also ran flat monitor age thing worked well didnt look clean essence go bestbuy like look different monitor see like
personally love two ultra wide curve 32 curve say personal preference friend dont like would go like micro center best buy possible mess around one see feel
reach certain size curved becomes necessity dell 40in 5k2k slight curve main use productivity
barely notice monitor curved care oled maybe extra uw monitor matter anything 32 doubt youll even notice
curved monitor went back flat panel personal preference would suggest trying look different panel person possible
love curved monitor love ultrawide resolution
depends panel type ip oled va panel need sure
say oled true regarding curved feature monitor want great wouldnt necessarily pick curved noncurved also predominantly use ultrawides although curved nice kind take away bit ultrawide feeling
strictly personal preference one since 2020 dont think ill ever go back noticeably worse fps game first adjust wont much effect skill level downside dual monitor make much easier throw video 2nd one watch play luckily steam overlay support pinning browser screen stay like sorta picture picture setup
love 34 ultrawide curved
tried one first time week ago friend place ok beautiful oled screen found increased fov bit disorienting think id prefer large 4k screen ive heard wide screen theyre helpful competitive shooter similar game knowledge surroundings difference virtual life death others said oled matter type screen get
curved better eye wont need refocus viewing left right v flat panel great extended session said mostly boil personal preference
curved good big like 34 ultra wide
curved screen arent better preference people prefer personally 34 curved ultrawide alienware odoled absolutely love perfect size curved screen add immersion oled fantastic picture quality black level perfect could never noncurved nonultrawide said people dont like ultrawides curved screen sit see like
new monitor first purchase build im working moved old 24 tn panel lcd monitor 45 lg curved oled eye still adjusting size love cant wait finish build really appreciate
35 ultrawide dell curved monitor absolutely love would go back said getting something smaller would probably go flat opinion curve really come play go past 3435 inch ultrawide go smaller 34 would think curve would annoying probably wouldnt close enough make difference sitting certain point away relation width screen curve beneficial otherwise opposite effect think love hate far away relation big screen hope made sense
rultrawidemasterrace friend want curved oled
curved monitor flat monitor sitting side side desk confidently say absolutely worth money wont even notice ur actually looking screen put money towards higher refresh rate resolution
small qol feature game changing though one bought used good price enjoy dont think id really pay much extra feature
personally made switch curved cant use normal monitor
happy curved monitor make gaming feel immersive
people telling get oled buying inflated cost hype machine influencers unless want spend 1k monitor even text screeen awful youll worry burn went high end ip panel looked fantastic
ultrawide must otherwise gimmic far tell ultrawides must imho yes get curved also dont get intel there non reason time around get 9800x3d
ive got 219 va curved black smearing really bad cold frame rate low computer max game thats problem warms quickly black smearing visible youre looking im sensitive sort thing fine really like curved monitor admittedly complete gimmick said really immersive fill lot peripheral work ux design consultancy tbh havent found curved element hindrance whatsoever really wanted curved monitor far tell dont really ip va oled black better theyd ip next monitor oled ultra wide love ultra wide
one start hitting 28 curved easier eye go either way like curved little better curved noncurved monitor much picture quality difference however eye see corner screen easier curved
anything 169 flat fine 219 beyond id highly suggest curved
youre going game get ryzen x3d cpu like 7800x3d 9800x3d perform better gaming draw much less power
got msi 49 oled like lounge play stuff much prefer curve 2 monitor setup way check monitor person thats route id go buying yeah im big fan
personally love curved monitor real love oled like others mentioned invest oled risk burn near bad first started coming earlier version alienware dwf still burn choose giving curved monitor oled id give curved get curved oled definitely prioritize oled opinion thats biased opinion also play wow nearly everyday
bought curved monitor cheapest option far even though huge fan necessarily difference curving negligible paired second flat monitor sometimes bit weird though also use well vertical screen replace main monitor biggest change aspect ratio imo way important curvature going wider merit though game like starcraft 2 bothersome widescreen setup
loved 1440 ultrawide curved screen productivity gaming upgraded flat 4k oled though oled vastly superior 4k curved option absurdly large took get used flat screen curved switch definitely worth
27inch flat 3234 inch see person 32 inch curved likely 1700r dell aw3225qf seems perfectly fine still would prefer flat though go oled priority debating 1440p4k arent anything cpu intensive please look towards obtaining 7800x3d 9800x3d instead intel i9 somehow expensive reallocate left fund towards saving monitor get frame pc run cooler decide go intel i9 grab used 12900k avoid potential issue matter whether theyve ironed trust viewpoint always safer
curved started gimmick counter bad va viewing angle thats dont really see 32 unless va panel personal opinion curved make sense ultra wides
think flat fine 32 inch 169 aspect ratio ultrawide large like say 40 inch 169 look like shit without curved screen imo bc vantage point edge extreme based field view 40 inch flat monitor hated edge screen lg oled 40 inch like 300 dollar still wouldnt buy one use monitor
also sure youre located lg selling 1440p 169 27 inch 240 hz oled 600 right feel like thats crazy good deal arent trying go 4k ultrawide
curved monitor subjective youll find people love others hate use two curved monitor like use work gaming watching video doesnt bother try see like
intel lmfao
someone array older vertical monitor gently angled inward understand allure mean view perpendicular display thing seem roughly size basically way compensating sitting close large display youll notice isnt feature even large tv
like curved
dont know itll youre playing different game probably better starting screen rog strix ordered brother came upgrade across board rog gave better depth contrast detail also cured eye strain didnt even know drawback ive seen far 32 fit used put 42
use one curved ultra wides work gave u instead 2 screen hate wanted one use one everyday
really like 32 curved felt like gave feel positive 32 27 time got serious competitive gamingplayedcasted siege competitively went 24 wasnt playing competitively id say 32 curved best world curved tv gimmick imo gaming monitor youre probably close enough actually matter id head best buy something try sticking face near distance typically gaming see like
sim racingflying yes curved definitely better course imo youre gon na sim racefly quest 3 headset id way gomuch immersivebut anyway opinion go msi mag321up 32in 4k 165hz qdoled monitori got black friday 669itll probablly 799 right buts worth
gaming 40 year made switched curved seeing friend year ago love curved monitor almost much child
ever buy curved 169 normal widescreen monitor curve subjectively better flat ultra wides
got samsung curved 24 144hz enjoy didnt pay premium got amazon warehouse deal 80 two year ago wouldnt gotten see difference really id say price flat 20 max sure otherwise meh
depends size monitor 24 27 curved unnecesary higher go better also keep mind curved monitor va panel notorious bad motion quality high tier latest va dont really issue high budget like better go oled
curved good go ultraaaaa wide like 49 something stay away plan get 27 32
theyre awful imo dont understand people enjoy weird fetish cuz look cool movie golden standard 2 monitor stup curve 1440p 120 hz apart dont buy intel cpu last 2 gen showed u theyre collapsing company dont give damn customer performance similar apple intel basically put new number cpu selling thing knew cpu broken month still quietly never told anyone kept selling go amd cheaper better actually something wrong delay release call back
dont personally care generally dont come high enough resolution use 27in 4k monitor
curved screen va va suck
indeed previous monitor curved quite liked switched current flat ultrawide kind annoying beginning however week didnt even notice anymore
flat ultra wide regret getting curved one side bit focus peripheral
dont oled burn problem solved lot office work pc gaming dont want become issue much issue tv since youre always watching something motion
there absolutely reason go i9 ryzen x3d cpu unless dont actually plan gaming
yeah advise going anything x3d
agree oled next upgrade nothing else matter saw comparison picture sold
two month ago would called comment elitist b would like apologize way used think oled different level id pick 5080oled 5090ipsva
motherboard would recommend 9800
ayyy aoc mentioned yes oled apparently best better color better transition time 900 definitely sick monitor last many year got ta watch static content burning screen
use 48 lg oled c1 main monitor holy shit game changer baldurs gate iii look absolutely stunning thing every game look gorgeous game especially look incredible 120hz refresh rate freesync almost zero compromise unless youre competitive gamer need 240hz refresh something experience hard beat
curve subjective hate ultrawides without curve love lg 800r sit centered sit one side look bad comparison previous monitor flat
learned put 2 input ultra wide monitor use 2 display idea tempting next time go monitor hunt
curved 34 ultrawide desk 25 flat 169 next work fine
maybe im weird id rather one 219 screen 23 169 screen
ive got two 28 inch curved monitor adjustable arm desk work fine ive previously used flat screen next one curved monitor subjective people dislike curved monitor others love there reason wont work 2nd monitor desk
swap back flat screen suddenly notice lol
wait va need
curved monitor distort view like setting fov high make sense
several game play intel show better performance benchmark test
used option tv
always better choice high tier va miniled last long time oled get burn issue sooner later
definitely curved monitor 4k market
burn issue solved theyre alot better saving screen nowadays pixel shift refresh technology youre super worried hide task bar run full screen youtube video every couple hour make coffee stretch leg really dont much
better old plasma tv day 100 big reason wont touch oled want worry image retention constantly looking lighter area screen see something actually burned distracting least get nice led even microled screen wont worry
guy serious need stop acting like 9800x3d 7800x3d cpu possibly run game well everything else shit educate httpsmyoutubecomwatchvxor2hr3opem
oled different animal well worth tbf someone get 5090 cant also afford decent monitor go cant actually afford 5090 first place
depends completely budget aesthetic preference personally went gigabyte aorus x870e pro ice like white build quality cheaper option people like black asus system swear taichi budget constraint b650 bios update could may run ram compatibility issue board
siigghhhh built new pc playing 28fps aoc since novembernow start looking monitor
two 27 1440p monitor side side one flat ip one curved va point curved one make flat one look little convex really like curve ip better va everything watching medium yeah game ip youtube reddit va
imo ultrawides time curved must
mainly play iracing curved imo pretty nice
confirm samsung odyssey neo g9 im hard pressed go anything else run dual monitor needed either pbp pip great work home wan na sneak little console gaming
personal taste wasnt trying say work noone
graphic card doesnt game support ultrawide also aint great
flat screen curved dont realize difference especially use
color get washed viewing angle compensate va panel introduced curved panel hit added panel
thats thing fov stretch view curved screen help make thing feel less distorted honestly match viewing angle depending curve screenratio
hopefully youre using userbenchmark
imo prefer non oled also bunch coding work computer id rather even think burn im using monitor work minor problem anything dont like paranoia give
cant turn monitor instead
theyre objectively best cpu one run game gaming price performance majority gamers want value money simply worth getting anything else unless youre using strict gaming
gon na spend i9 money may well get extra perk x3d chip
write userbenchmark something
intel run hotter doesnt support ecc kill i9 workstation use case amd 16 core ryzen threadripper better pick x3d
well decent mean 1000 usd people dont put much importance monitor justify 1000 didnt either impulse buy probably favourite impulse buy
aesthetic wise dont care look going transparent case anything would compatible x870e id rather deal compatibility issue
need look obviously buy aoc monitor
agree thats reason previous monitor flat wanted ip said ultrawides need curve regular monitor dont mind either definitely prefer ip va recently bought 39 lg oled aggressive 800r curve im loving
every game play isnt old support 219 well mostly play newer title im playing game like 2012 im fine 169
maybe mostly noticable ultrawide looking flat screen feel like bending way curved monitor look exactly like every part screen similar distance
game simulate flat camera sensor far know assume screen flat window game world ever seen curved monitor option game fov distortion percieved sit wrong distance screen
yeah needed use screen saver oled got enough stuff prevent
talking 1080p yeah performance good worth spending extra 300 youd surprised close performance 14700k 9800x3d 4k dont care budget yeah get 9800x3d 5090 care majority gamers budgeting real always splurge spend gpu first
dude 14700k 330 14900k 430 arent expensive anymore plus intel cpu better every task isnt gaming matter lot people
cant possibly compare threadripper 300400 cpu dont know youre talking 14900k support ecc huh
ordered 3440x1440p oled 550usd 50
x870s take am5 perfect chipset 9800 cpu chipset newer better bios update higher mhz ram stability youll still want check qvl ram though im running 96gb 6400mhz get 8200 mhz moment x870e usbsata slot pcie lane regular x870 good choice choose e variant went pro codec feature
aggressive curve make sense 1500r curve lot monitor come nothing nobody sits 15 meter 24 27 monitor monitor probably equates 750r thats sit 800r would perfect
ya also curve prominent others 2 curve monitor curve pretty mild
simply go 7800x3d closer price point 14700k still get better performance lower power consumption
14700k poisoned product given intels issue
op playing wow main game way heavy cpu gpu especially raid big hub money go fruther spluring cpu gpu
4k dumb gaming cpu 150 less isnt getting anything gpu current pricing 14700k get annihilated 9800x3d isnt close white knighting intel something pointless havent relevant gaming three generation isnt news gap widened
plus intel cpu better every task isnt gaming getting information blanket intel v amd statement talking specific cpu
e core shit everything
regular ryzen support ecc even low mid range motherboards dont need threadripper unless want 16 core number 14900k motherboards support ecc vanishingly small practically speaking couldnt decent ecc build ecc motherboards dont good vrm used buy xeons saved ton money going zen1234
talk making impatiently wait 45 5k2k oled lg comin april
120 difference right get good deal intel motherboards fewer people buying
wow run well potato
4k dumb gaming also story 1440p isnt much performance upgrade 9800x3d 14700k 150 less 600 cpu find v 330 cpu nearly double price im white knighting intel 7700x 6700xt people gone crazy suggesting everything outside new x3d model complete shit arent
specific cpu 14700k performs better productivity task 9800x3d
thing going sell current pc cost also dont think 6750xt would push damn afford good stuff thing going awesome
wouldnt use 14th gen intel free know issue youre dumb reason buy intel even care budget
yeah 14th gen intel cpu cooking alarming rate wouldnt buy shit 90 work replace workstation send warranty repair count intel cpu unaliving random
u forget every new cpu requires new mobo intel however am5 start 7800x3d 5 year get upgrade cpu intel new setup everytime
479 cpu v 330 cpu im comparing scalper price msrp youre really disingenuous thats youre also 14700k scalped 515 brings difference 85 youre comparing scalper price 4k dumb uplift resolution doesnt offset performance hit take fps setting people cant even tell difference 1440p highultra 120 fps 4k mediumhigh 75 fps stupid always dont power run modern aaa game 4k decent frame rate also fact normal viewing distance anything 32 basically imperceptible isnt really 40 becomes noticeable like 24 1440p v 1080p isnt big difference step 27 32 becomes meaningful pixel density start matter size add there reason every single reputable content creator hardware channel say 1440p sweet spot gaming 4k great productivity medium streaming big enough screen never made sense gaming
okay discussion gaming cpu productivity cpu want talk productivity cpu amd doesnt play around either amd better objective choice right
need 40905090 use bad boy reason didnt wait id hate 4080s getting 60fps especially battlefield nothing 120 work fps
price id pick amd 1010 since ive seen single problem last month new intel cpu im okay recommending price worth people getting arm parroting people said
thats true utilize older motherboards 14th gen cpu yes came arrowlake brand new cpu motherboard line amd wont making am5 system 5 year theyve said support till 2027 2 year mean likely see 1 lineup am5 cpu amd 10 11 series am6 platform
excuse im disingenuous 479 might msrp since launched good luck getting price people jumped 600 never came maybe yesterday whole point 14700k cheap 515 idk ive seen 4k oled game put everything else shame youre already talking buying expensive part wouldnt run game 4k better objectively maybe really dont care take
dont think parroting anything issue real verifiable update intel mobo manufacturer didnt completely solve issue
disingenuous youre comparing scalper price msrp thats literally definition one need gaming pc survive cpu stock idk maybe wait 4k youre gaslighting ive seen im sorry 1440p uw oled setting cranked 150 fps blow away 4k mediumhigh setting struggling get 90 fps also 9800x3d isnt expensive part even close would 9950x3d 14900k equivalent whatever current intel offering intel hasnt compelling want budget option 7600x3d 299 way better value money also smoke 14700k gaming like take im basing statement objective number fact
want play 1080p type build would probably get best around performance possible around 1200 httpspcpartpickercomlistmxdsmc slightly cheaper build much easier future upgrade path could something like httpspcpartpickercomlistwyvtqd best possible budget build definitely work 1080p maybe super high setting may able play brand new graphically intense game year future could something like httpspcpartpickercomlistmcjqgj 750 question let know
removed old ram put new ram computer still connected power source
sorry wouldnt switch psu unplug working pc common sense
installed new ram accidentally turned computer turned bios likely initiating ram training interrupted remove coin battery 5mins reset bios put back try bios backuprestore option may reinstall bios always physically remove power cable turn psu swapping hardware
something try unplug machine wall outlet disconnect 24pin cable motherboard remove ram wait 10 minute let residual charge dissipate reconnect power connector try power pc btw motherboard debug led bottomleft area light lit see manual httpswwwgigabytecommotherboardz590ivisiondrev10supportsupportdl
sound like fried motherboard
tried old ram system wouldnt power newer module
correct like people forget turn psu first powering pc completely forgot turn working
plugged psu switched better unplugged
go morning cmos battery hidden inside rear io even gained access battery wrapped black tape wire running directly anybody would ever need replace battery simple putting new cr2032
unfortunately step work im even getting point debug led light pc truly unresponsive
im thinking thats possibly still think rather unfortunate 1 stick ram completely inserted point turning
isnt powerswitched unplugged power button held 20 second going best practice understand still take power usually plugged powering component
thats shame case simple swap tablet coin battery covered tape disconnect wire small socket connects battery might bit fiddly remove put back
psu switch electricity flow psucomputer leaving psupc grounded relatively important unplug psu pc grounded technically connecting ground pc jumper cable separately grounding esd strap better may seem like overkill statistically likely break anything anywhere handle pcbs might susceptible esd production scale take precaution often even outside scope like esd mat heel strap grounded esd lab coat odds low leaving pc grounded free
uuumm esd risk depends live uk humidity quite hight risk low still happen less likely live low humidity area risk higher always ground avoid problem moon walking carpet work pc im sorry disagree safe practice unplug power working inside pc
pc grounded unless floating air ground literally ground
ground electrically grounded want get electrical ground ground shove 10 ft metal pole earth carpet hardwood flooring rarely function electrical ground many pc case electrically isolated rubber foot
pc id throw 5700x3d current pc dump rest budget gpu depends use case though type game play else pc besides gaming often stuff like
thank ur answer run gigantic excel file video editing play big strategy 4x game think paradox sometimes aaa rarely considering going 5950x max am4 friend told would bad would missing ddr5 future evolutvity play 1440p ultrawide told needed big cpu manage 5120x also told sub optimal go gc point would expensive performance upside
friend told would bad would missing ddr5 future evolutvity flippant answer 2700x 5700x3d 5900x5950x pipeline perfect use case existing am4 pc give performance youre looking doesnt matter version ddr youre planning upgrading ram anyway 16gb really slow kit something buying am5 start make sense supporting platform good send 5700x3d 59x0x cpu thats exactly couple year ago went 2700x 5800x3d already really good x470 board ram kit pc wont upgraded am6 probably
oh right waiting am6 could nice play already 32go ram mean ever go let say 4080 super 5950x 32go ddr4 would suboptimal 4080 play 1440p ultrawide 240hz
percore performance ryzen 5000 slower ryzen 7000 5700x3d worthwhile extra cache help keep core fed performance maximized yeah would suboptimal compared running am5 pc ryzen 5000 nonx3d chip 240hz making less less sense youre upgrading cpu get 5700x3d59x0x decide jump am5 year two youll difference youll pay cpu resale value
alright im spending 400 900 saying consider waiting coming back least 2k ideally would like 1st upgrade cpu gc dont want go 5950x would mean subpar performance bottlenecking next gc
im thinking asus strix b650ef trident z5 neo 6000 cl30 7800x3d long would able push gpu upgrade
cant predict future use longer provides performance want need
general advice go pcpartpickercom change country italy look part want figure budget make sense gpu even italy best option probably going radeon 6600 around 240ish euro intel b570 b580 like 310340 euro case case seems plenty big dont think would issue trying put budget gpu sizing power supply psu sits bottom usually back case look instruction video access psu usually simple panel back bottom unscrew screw get need read physical psu know system many watt supply really way unless purchase order bought pc
think real choice gigabyte z790m elite ax ice version gorgeous
see particular reason ive also noticed there asus prime z790m currently two im stuck deciding factor im ear
asus board worse every possible way stock almost everywhere plus asus break rma youll get back 6 month later smashed hammer refuse warranty request
see concern im currently black set think white board compliment well mix match
oh dunno looking board matx lga 1700 kind sparse whole time board stock 15th gen may look b760 board asus alright match better price find kind crazy would return 14900k buy amd
hmmm see sure amd route concern b760 board majority time pointed worse z790 therefore price may well go z790 im wondering youre thought maybe b760 board arent bad painted thanks help
well b760 generally lower spec overclock capability besides ram choice slim otherwise gigabyte make black version board seems get china right
oh see ill take look board however 14900k course almost reason overclocking ever needed however ive seen many place state b760 board arent good concern know good quality b760 board perchance
honest cant even find decent ddr5 b760 board period ddr4 lower cost platform id say get asus like find good price since match build although even think vrm struggle 14900k
think maybe go gigabyte hope look alright seeing would prefer performance look slightly checked place said gigabyte ice one mentioned really decent would also agree superior board smarter choice also sorry constant question motherboards strong point
dont know wont actual benchmark come
5070 4070 super
wait benchmark
5070 annihilates 3070 beat 4070 cheaper along new technology look extremely good far
gave bought 4070super
70 series releasing
comment rught gold
5070 expensive 4070 itll priced similar 4070 super
4070 didnt beat 3070 term efficiency mean
didnt wan na wait long tbh
honestly assumed wouldve already posted
meant msrp price honestly pretty cheap msrp
youre worried efficiency upgrade psu
nvidia slowrolling review process rtx 5090 5080 release january 30th rtx 5090 review embargo january 24th 1 week release rtx 5080 review embargo last heard january 30th day release thats good sign rtx 5070 5070 ti rumored released february 20th dont believe anyone know review embargo set expire yet
well yeah true although ground reality different country itll cost 2030 actual pricing due scalper n stuff
yea still think people find 5070s cheaper 4070s even scalper 50 decreased msrp know 5070 wont expensive 4070s maybe first day scarcity definitely worth price 4070 better tech less money

meh youre still 25c away critical temp cpu nothing worry havent monitoring along who say hasnt always like reapply thermal paste internet voodoo part effective thermal interface material degradeddried doesnt job anymore uncommon temp fine dont require anything verify rad clean free clogged dust aio performing exactly id expect considering little 120mm also heat dissipation aios affected difference temp coolant air used remove heat coolant youre using fan aio exhaust fan mean aios cooling really efficient since youre pushing heated air case rad want efficient aio two thing 1 make fan aio intake drawing cool air outside case rad 2 add second fan one either side rad fan move air direction called pushpull ive seen adding push pull fan reduce temp 810c dont need anything temp fine system acting expected

dont temperature reading unfortunately
getting lmao 2 year warranty dont think ever computer kind last less 4 year maybe fan like 8 year old ryzen 1000 series build still function
way tell stop working completely temp arent spot youre happy fact made post hint latter understand wanting spend money older build like get nice air cooler like thermalright assassin 17 u
8 year old ryzen 1000 series build still function hobby builder lot experience tell previous comment designed 2 year something reflected longevity build ive made 20ish year 400 build still going ive repeat buyer 56 year apart still perfectly running system wanted newerupraded rig personal computer least 10 year old server 17 year old c2q q9650 never shut computer either theyve actually many year straight
talking capacity capacity requirement determined workload 10 gallon water getting 16 gallon tank make difference compared getting 32 gallon tank matter 16 gallon need store capacity make mentionable difference
whats cost ram stick youre better buying prebuilt point tbh cost performance way higher
would help performance higher speedlower latency ram ofc somehow scenario use 16gb ram upgrading capacity improve performance
likely help performance usually user dont manage resource good keeping bunch thing open game poorly optimized quickly limit cache total ram usage let say 12gb mean there 4gb left cache ram there kore possibility cache thus increase performance
wont see performance gain gaming 4k video editing something like yes see gain
cpu ancient 32 gb ram nice likely wont much need new cpu least
youre still old system would save new build second hand newish build unless find hitting 16gb ram often 32 going tangible performance improvement
game day improve performance go 16gb 32gb many system many generation behind modern hardware thats likely bottlenecked cpu gpu detail depends upon exact game screen resolution game setting also motherboard support 2x16 generally preferred 4x8 even ddr4 memory easier achieve xmp setting easier achieve retain stability easier overclock speed latency memory matter number gb
love analogy course question becomes many gallon game play use game day might benefit 16gb id guess older hardware likely bottleneck anyway
imma go work hour since dont wan na explain country economy right 32gb ddr3 day work

specifically 4070 better 7800xt youd need pay besides creative work theyve got av1 encoders
ive heard read 4070 stable overall typically driver smoother rollout also tends pull ahead 7800xt nongame related task

driver equal lately actually nvidia messing driver im sure unlucky streak
got 4070ti compared fsr 7800xt specifically first descendant close enough one another decided waiting game adapt fsr way go instead presuming everyones going use dlss since pretty much exact output considering cost extra
use case primarily gaming editing art smooth experience overall

yeah thats figured 40 since stopped production leaning towards 5080 far price go since im pretty sure 5080 5090s getting released 30th mainly want able play game like monster hunter wild high graphic high fps play shooter high fps mind

oh confused steam invite ill look bit
tbh could different thing build game possible gpu hitting vram limit especially game 1440p although shouldnt cause stuttering thing like blender best guess ram problem 2 different set running different frequency different capacity probably different timing generally bad idea clearly work case stuttering issue 2 8gb stick would first one go depending much multitasking anyway might get better performance removing 2 stick anyway memory controller best 2 stick total dual channel right stick downclocked least 3200mhz plus whatever instability possible incompatibility might introducing 32gb plenty use case anyway also could temp since already mentioned im guessing checked
agree ram suggestion ill see removing 16gb set work able fine 32 concern sql server like hog ram fine temp arent much concern monitor also live cold place inside house regularly reach 50degf
yeah without question 9700x better 7700x tho biggest difference basically way lower tdp 65w compared 105w 7700x oh 30bucks brother get heat long u
9700x 65w tdp pretty huge considering equal better 7700x especially youre playing cpu intensive game
9700x slightly better energy efficient worth 30
versus good httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewscpuhierarchy4312htmlhttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewscpuhierarchy4312html 9700x better especially productivity task efficient run cooler worth extra 30 imo
practical purpose equal performance two computer side side either cpu wouldnt know difference 9700x technically use less power unless always maxing cpu really noticeable

laptop processor gpus operate substantially reduced power level desktop version thus produce level detail rendering andor fps 14th gen laptop processor might momentary burst performance similar 14th gen desktop processor type sustained load gaming throttle back power need thermal management laptop gpus far far far less capable desktop gpus circuitry power level 4080 laptop gpu far far less capable 4080 desktop gpu arent even comparable difference completely apparent higher resolution higher level graphic setting anything simple game specific gaming laptop somewhere cost extra size weight laptop implement greater thermal cooling allow somewhat higher laptop performance still arent anywhere close competitive appropriately equipped desktop system
laptop 13900 i9 cpu 32gb ddr55600 4080 gpu get least twice fps laptop 12900 i9 cpu 40gb ddr44200 3060 gpu also run one 4080 gpu max ultra settimgs one 3060 gpu run high medium setting get half fps
400 gpu 1000 gpu show graphic essentially assuming cheaper card enough vram 8gb vram problem may get like 30fps 400 gpu perhaps 60fps 1000 gpu game definitely notice difference 30 60fps whether worth thats
basically make difference get past 40 fps unless enables upgrade bigger higher resolution screen played screen 1080p 1440p 17 inch 27 inch doesnt make much difference though exception youre trying shoot people long way away iron sight milsim game big 4k monitor would great ultrawide peripheral vision doesnt really change anything unless talking pro level player need every m response time something might find high quality imagery pleasing doesnt really change game pro often use lower graphic setting get advantage either frame rate less screen clutter

buy 4070 super unless youre really looking forward mfg

price gap 4070s ti stupid
there zero inventory reasonable price theyve production like 2 month
5070 nowhere near 4090 unless use fake frame
bruh really said disappointment shitwreck 5070 4090 equivalent lmao
really considering 4070 ti super basically slightly slower 4080 faster 4070
yeah dont think op getting 4070 ti super 520 usd make worth

yea 6600xt suck 1440p stated im upgrading 7800xt wondering cpu would good pair besides 5700x3d
7600x otherwise upgrade 5700x3d aliexpress
get usbpci post card connect usb port see seeing post code generated make certain memory click socket ejector fully closed post label style memory stick using
think install use new gpu concern issue actually notice obvious choice cpu upgrade am4 5700x3d 5800x3d impact would make entirely depends workload context provided notice performance varies per gameprogram isnt static one obvious cpu gpu relationship isnt static universal
best value upgrade get 5700x3d itll massive upgrade obviously get performance upgrade am5 get 78009800x3d however price msrp youd paying 23 time much cpu alone outside motherboard ram upgrade imo logical upgrade 5700x3d wont break bank youll likely able keep another generation 2 upgrading
depends game want play anything 2022 neweraaa youll problem am4 choice worth used 5800x3d 400 5700x3d new 170230 youre usa live near microcenter could 7600x 300 usd motherboard 16 gb ddr5
r7 3700x botlleneck 4080s could always drop r7 5700x3d 200 fine play 1440p4k
enjoy bit always bottleneck kind
knowing resolution target frame important answer question aim 240fps 1080p definitely get better cpu playing 1440p4k 60fps fine although better cpu would give performance matter resolution
worth 2700x handle game moment 60 fps game played 2070s worked fine better new card worse
id say spend bit get 5700x3d wait shipping perhaps consider ordering aliexpress
play 1080p1440p 5700x3d play 4k cpu shouldnt big issue experience upgrading 2070s 7900xt upgrading 3900x 9800x3d gon na notice gpu upgrade cpu upgrade depends play gpu demanding probably wont notice much difference 4k maybe less stutter didnt 1440p could notice game
youve spent 1k 4080 spent 150200 upgrade cpu 5700x3d otherwise expensive new gpu partially unused system performance one much cheaper gpu
absolutely bottlenecked newer intense title cpu 5700x3d partner well 4080s cheap chip price performance 3700x causing bottleneck 7900gre 1080p 1440p spacemarine 2 switching 5700x3d made issue go away entirely
find soon enough whats point asking bunch random people online
everyone different requirement cant say exactly enough see go decide whether youre happy upgrade performance benefit upgrade would depend application setting 5700x3d 50 faster game example kingdom come deliverance rattay square thatd make big impact opinion maybe much war thunder adobe premiere
something somewhere always bottlenecking would gpu preform better 5700x3d yeah would even better 5800x3d super hard aquire right 3700x better nothing install 4080s enjoy life game generating frame monitor display leave alone get screen tearing upgrade
1440p probably enough
op similar upgrade exact cpu replaced 2070s 4070s thing great far sure 4080s fare wanted chime looking upgrade cpu soon though looking deal
depends 4080 super bottlenecked 3700x especially play 1080p youre playing 1440p ultra even 4k youll might alright also depends game play
think would enough depending resolution youre playing im running 3950x nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super since im playing 4k gpu typically 99 utilized pretty rare would run cpu bottleneck unless youre running 1080 1440p rtx 4080 super though really playing 4k get value powerful gpu
depends game resolution tbh cpu heavy game would see huge difference performance newer cpu especially x3d one
able find 4080s havent found one stock month
go 5700x3d aliexpress milk am6
went 3700x 5800x3d game fps didnt increase low went way everything much smoother
mind askingwhere get 4080 price im searching one im seeing crazy price
old 3700x wasnt really task 3060 ti 1080p
amazon sold today msrp thats correct yea 5700x3d way cheaper
fair newer game even 7500f 7600 par 5700x3d thats want fair get foot door am5 getting support 2028 least give least like ryzen 10th 11th gen see improvement
agree sake perpetuating bottleneck fear would logical use card first determine issue theyre even noticeable spending money
sold either retailer stock one jack price scalper needed
get youre saying rtx 4080s wicked fast crazy good gpus become ryzen 7 3700x isnt obsolete bad cpu card yea gon na hold back
uexe0n 5700x3 depends life checked store website country available around 25018 vat idk kind price expectconsider cheap
literally zero reason upgrade cpu everything want play working perfectly fine though matte specific benchmarcks better dont appy game setting playing benchmark often done 1080p 4090 highlite cpu limitation people playing 60fps 1440p4k see small fraction benefit depending game setting play might get benefit especially playing 60fps
depends exact workload doesnt make noticeable difference ops workload spends hundred upgrade doesnt make noticeable difference care fps number dont play game staring fps counter mean shouldnt fixing issue dont exist step 1 fixing issue identifying issue exists begin
live 21 vat 5700x3d around 275 7800x3d 9800x3d hovering around 600 am5 cpu good arent performing x2 5700x3d without considering mobo ram cost 30 increase
said could always drop get he happy ryzen 7 3700x keep asked case need new cpu could get answered sure think im telling get one mandatory whatever
okay dude youre nitpicking point come didnt specify anything like coding 3d modelling videophoto editing making music whatever productivity task 99 gaming let honest care fps number dont play game staring fps counter fps smoother question fuckin mark would buy damn 4080s god damn fps wanted performance could pick something like 3060 call day
sure think im telling get one mandatory whatever got defensive first replied reply basically stating issue
op asked 3700x enough much impact upgrade would seems knowassume could get faster frame rate cpu upgrade question much faster another am4 cpu would whether itd worth help figure cant definitively answer without knowing especially much part might heavily gpulimited happy performance uplift even 3700x becomes bottleneck might planning increase gpudependent graphic setting resolution necessarily frame rate 2070s broke werent necessarily unsatisfied
bottleneck future proofing identified first gpu upgrade fine unless review benchmarking show cpu definitely gimping experience otherwise research show fine 1440 4k testing actually system there real identifiable bottleneck gpu obviously underperforms expected user save money especially talking hundred dollar even 1000 upgrade am5 need preemptively upgrade gpu alone give big boost little cpu utilization bottlenecking course totally depends user love cpu gpu dependent title
im eyeing potential release 9800x3d month
people going tell buy amd x3d chip upgrade current mobo would 11900k would waste money prefer intel released worthwile cpu since 12th gen much point upgrading chip several generation old unless get killer deal 11900k paired 4080 super gaming 1440p ultrawide refresh rate 175hz normally target 120 fps dont notice big frame drop sure something else causing im using z590 evga board ram speed 32gb
9800x3d overkill 3080 mean lot headroom upgrade gpu future
man quick googling newest x3d kcd2s recommendation 7800x3d showed 9800x3d coming soon mistake
yeah definitely think going ddr5 best way go dont need buy overkill probably sell pc give kid rtx3080 longer good enough gaming sure happens newer game struggle get stable frame rate feel awful lot newer title go play older game 2022 earlier type deal dont issue recently noticed mortal online 2 started happening upgraded ue5 ash creation probably game fault enshrouded ive never able play game due bad performance play game like kcd ultra presets getting pretty steady locked 80fps bellwright locked 120fps ultra presets soulmask also hit 120fps nearly locked ultra
7800x3d line 3080 better option whenever bought pc ddr5 still test phase lot people recommending lot upgrade thing missed due purchase timing
7800x3d 9800x3d like top end pair 40905090 chip 3080 close 4070 pair nicely 7600x good enough gpu id look plan get new gpu base cpu pick around keeping 3080 7600x7700x probably good enough planning getting 60806090 say 2 year dont want cpu issue spend extra get 9800x3d today going consider 6070 2 year maybe get 7600x today get whatever amd launch next instead am5 support new chip coming till least 2027
put current psu facebook marketplace website regarding psu id say 1000w enough 5090 trend power consumption going remains might enough future flagship card
get pcpartpicker calculates peak power draw every component case real world usage
minimum reccomended power supply 1000w would go 1200
7600x make able keep motherboard longer since am5 chip think part smart someone know amd graphic card chip imagine dont need expensive one need
assuming access aliexpress get 7500f7400f build am5 machine similar price am4
upgrade cpu 5700x3d
5700x3d gaming 5950x work
5700x3d 180200 sale kinda crazy price best gaming fine 40804090 type card reasonable resolution theyre 1080p card
5700x3d need support even 4080s
well said able actually get 5080 fe may paper launch
sound like 5090 paper launch 5080 really delivered decent number retailer still doesnt mean going able find anywhere less double msrp next month bet
id probably get 7700x 9700x instead paying scalper price 9800x3d use money towards better gpu point id wait rtx 5000 series get 5070 ti also unless motherboard feature need could save money get cheaper one new amd one launched good spec 200

thanks suggestion buddy
edited post mate
ya build good p power supply overkill tho 800900w plenty
64gb ram work fine
sure would also overkill pc intended gaming
32 perfect

thats part reason amazon screwing people legitimate return dude get jacked stick doesnt work cant get money back amazon mood thats ok got ok live mistake consequence thereof
thats called fraud

oh see
tile mem test rn
wouldnt let return
im planning use 5700x3d rig longer 5 year minimum hopefully 7
considering still hundred million gamers am4 still exclusively play 1080p last many year come amd still releasing am4 cpu day reason there
3000 series chip 3 generation old good enough run modern game 2000 series 4 generation old arguably good enough lowered setting 5800x3d although 2 generation old meet beat 1 generation old 7000x chip gaming assuming 34 generation old precedent weve established hold got much 12 year left thing
wouldnt surprised am4 x3d chip couldnt skip am5 altogether 5600x3d house awesome 1440p
am4 build b550 chipset 5800x3d already installed probably good 4 6 year longer need dont change dramatically unless window 14 come wont run extraneous shit might want gpu upgrade point might need better psu upgrade needed
looking probably many many year youre happy 1080p im using 12 yr old cpu 8yr old gpu playing 1080p 60fps happily
honestly break sound like play competitive game 1080p dont need much
youre fine youre happy performance id upgrade part first imo
imagine fine awhile especially 1080p moderate setting
upgraded 5800x3d 7900xt 2 year ago intention upgrade anything am6 come theyre 2yr cadence cpu generation 9000 came couple month ago 11000 mid next year presumably am5 3rd probably final generation am5 meaning am6 would time 2028
let get time machine hold ill right back
answered youre question
upgrade game struggling
thank everyone great advice think know plan thanks yall keep cpu upgrade psu case gpu 16gb vram span upgrade 35 year dont need am5 new cpu least 7 year based gaming pattern
especially 1080p dont viewpoint anything 144hz max setting unacceptable youll fine year current setup bit better gpu game find isnt running well youd like im still running rx 580 4gb version fine everything ive wanted play far adjust setting get smoother framerates course yet hindrance ive thought absolutely upgrade point youll know literally play game want game performing poorly dont fun might time start upgrading
built am4 2020 going upgrade cpu gpu easily make last least 23 year
core i75775c came oodles cache 128mb edram held well still winning certain gaming benchmark 10th generation core anandtechs 2020 retrospectivehttpswwwanandtechcomshow16195abroadwellretrospectivereviewin2020isedramstillworthit youre gamer later get access x3d chip think reasonable think chip substantially outlive nonx3d am4 cpu good chance serving beginning 2030s upgraded partner 5600xs 5700x3ds based logic
two generation am5 support motherboards component continue dwindle said 5800x3d solid piece cpu last year come
really dont much worry pcie 4 3d cache handle game gpus least 3 yearsmore likely 5
really depends mean longevity dont need play literally every game 60 fps minimum lastfor long time there already game challenge even stay away unoptimized big open world game fine
am4 solid lineup think got least 23 year
strongest am4 cpu strong weakest am5 cpu tell age
also upgraded 6 year old am4 system 5900x 7900xt bought aorus fo27q327 qd oled 1440p monitor asus prime x470 pro required bios update working fine may upgrade corsair h100i pro 360 aio 5900x run bit hot
5800x3d 4080s uw1440p plano keeping least 4 year
still game 4770 good time 23 year problem maybe turn graphic notch isnt big deal
point expect skip am5 move 5800x3d first second gen am6 intel get shit together
game already becoming unviable unless like console framerates cpu age faster gpus
modern cpu last another 56 year
5800x3d doesnt plan upgrade am6 roll assuming release around 20272028
probably whenever want upgrade gpu since 5800x3d easily handle 7600 gpu tap youll probably upgrade cpu
long work alive mate cpu good
4k player 5950x wait least am6 people x3d chip willshould propably
im 4k 5700x3d long run
one pc generation usually last 57 year one component functional build new pc point upgrading
youre gon na last least one gpu upgrade
would benefit upgrading gpu adopting am5 also am5 running high premium due intels goofiness youre going lesser cpu money fyi l monster am5 build cpu upgraded am4 3600x 5900x w 4080 super im wondering l bother ill follow donate cpu daughter starting game total loss waste timemoney fomo
im sure somebody said till happy wasnt happy first am4 build couldnt play 4k good xbox im still completly happy am5 build game need play turn back console still doesnt play better console 7900gre 7600x3d 32gb ram live pc never good enough justify cost
hoping around planning gpu upgrade soon curious see handle high fps gaming 1440p
exactly 3600x lasted five year hope 5700x3d go another five
cheap relatively powerful cpu profitable market get 5700x3d 200 buck well pretty much game likely continue least year especially youre gaming higher resolution real bottleneck performance graphic card
3600 worked well upgraded 5700 get year mobo
5800x3d dont think ill need upgrade am6
bigger ssd faster ram better cooling case anything else could think dont want upgrade mobo swap cpu gpu well
please come back let u know unknown company next nvidia youre tia
ah 23 year viable
upgraded 5900x 3090 9800x3d 3090 notice much better experience fps much higher crispness smoothness noticeable
upgrade 5700x3d 4070 super run beautifully 1440p
get 5700x3d 200 buck anymore cant went microcenter theyre 220 tax
already 16 32 gb wouldnt touch ram unless like really old ddr42133 something x3d cache blunts impact faster ram would upgrade ram hitting capacity limit cant take forward isnt huge driver performance setup
thats cpu handle way better 7600 id upgrade gpu first
motherboard limit pcie x4 based ssds gpus faster ram dependent motherboard running ddr43600 4000 sweet spot am4 chip may need replace psu support 12v 2x6 assuming actually fixed melting connector issue different case need something cooling fan rgb
got really good cpu might wan na upgrade gpu sometime line 7800xt 7900xt whatever nvidia comparable card golden 23 year easily
1080p id say 23 even longer
dont 4070 rx 7800 xt essentially say far every game played run fantastically
setup fantastic 1440p
good hear 3070ti looking either 4070ti super 5070ti big hurry swapped 1000w psu im ready
hell yeah thats awesome know si amd card big dooky game picked rtx 4070 gon na get 5700x3d convinced
damn im sorry got mine new year eve 179tax super stoked didnt think gon na able get good upgrade anytime soon found 6750xt microcenter really good price
old 2133 seemed like painful process involving hard reset get 3600 work 32gb 3200 like 50 though
hoping late jan release new card guess grab one april
thats misnomer lol 1080p care better cpu get crazy high fps realistically 6th gen intel i7s still decent almost every game op fine dont let got ta buy 400 cpu brainrot sub get
thank
ya fault waiting damn im salty guess im staying 3700x lol
need find someone done work memory scaling ryzen see worth price time treasure zen 2 zen 3 better board usually 3600 youre older board harder get running
dont upgrade dont need unless planning move 1440p case 7800xt 9070xt would perfect
get crazy high fps part important people tell 1080p need cpu usually leave feed high end graphic card fast enough framerate becomes gpulimited 1080p60 need exactly cpu power 4k60 maybe even less due lod culling reason using 1080p screen 1080p bought 1080p240 screen want feed regular cpu upgrade cadence fine
honestly 3700x probably fine tariff coming might hard upgradebut im sure good deal show point got ta patient friend upgraded 8700k used 3700x one friend massive uplift
hitch 7600 right 8gb vram
idea value currency wise part ok get faster ram 5200c40 damn slow usual aiming point 6000c30 6000c36 significantly cheaper
different note havent bought return try use sata ssd price gone way itd much faster hdd
youre buying new cheapest 16gb kit 3200mhzcl16 ram httpspcpartpickercomproductp4fkhxsiliconpowersp016gxlzu320bdaj516gb2x8gbddr43200cl16memorysp016gxlzu320bdaj5
rated speed gen cpu 2666 however intel almost always run well stock xmp profile 3200 probably easiest might get 3600 working really going make much difference reason youre going 7820x already found dirt cheap mean issue reusing dont want see someone spending top dollar ancient hardware something entry level modern era smoke crap
16gb 3000 mhz first pc fine
x299 quad channel memory get 4 stick ziiiing
100 important part build want game ssd main hard drive else hell take forever load
ive gone back forth ssd hdd ive read thing running didnt make decision easier hdd return would adding ssd hdd benefit
get dirt cheap first pc opportunity learnme teach learn lol cpu mb going need upgraded followed gpu essentially wanted go cheap possibly learning experience better understanding need pull later he turning 9 still young likely wont put much strain bit
would 32gb add benefit current cpu 16gb pretty much max
ssd improve load speed significant amount personally couple ssds hdd ssd load game faster hdd would say would worth imo
sata ssd many many time faster hdd system way responsive video game benefit well get decent 2tb ssd 90100 easily cover game listed many 1tb would probably fine well like he storing ton video something
return barracuda getting 2tb sata ssd isnt stretching budget much id could combination get 1tb ssd 1tb hdd window installed ssd important game ssd hdd hold random stuff either way using ssd really help loading time speed computer
use case extra 16gb would benefit really grab 2x8gb kit 3200mhz thats cl16
one two count em two power supply
would two 5090s even practical use short answer dont think nvidia actually intends anybody use one system especially given big
2200w psu
missing something absolutely yes youre missing fact money build threadripper dual 5090s definitely afford couple hundred buck custom case fabricated seriously planning build 10000 pc 150 consumer grade gaming case
use case two gpus going many niche case people need willing pay
server case answer
server enterprise market always provided big multiple power supply system multi cpu system different scope normal consumer grade equipment
ive definitely seen people use two psus build jump couple pin mobo power connector make automatically turn onoff switch flicked
point run risk tripping shit 120v
reason wouldnt work
anyone need one graphic card decade showing much disposable income sli hasnt thing year standpoint average gamer there benefit anymore
use ai im sure nvidia aware
theyre actually dual slot card compared triple slot 4090s
know unit
dont need double psu requirement extra card includes cpu component 5090 tdp 575w add 1000w recommendation single card system 1600w psu two card multiple company make 1600w psus seasonic also make 2200w unit want run 3 5090s theyre cheap afford card 5600 usd psu probably ainit problem
hahaha alright good point looking something like corsair 9000d initially
post work machine learning
1400w 15a breaker home 20 amp circuit get almost 2000w
fe card yes people using fe card
none north america max allowed wattage consumer appliance sustained load 1500w
seasonic prime 2200 1600 quiet dark power 1600 silverstone ha 2050 phanteks rrvolt 1600 v8 would give enough two 5090s
world need
go 1600w psu traditional atx case set go powerful server rack style setup redundant psus
laugh 230v regular domestic 10 main run 2000w problem 3kw heavy duty 15a circuit
1300w power supply already dims light turn pc
sure pay per kwh
thatd vary country world us 220230v
thats hugely overkill motherboard cooler save bunch money going something cheaper also dont need 850w power supply 650w enough 4070s 750 enough 7800xt 7900xt 7800xt much cheaper 4070s brainer whats price 7900xt live
depends type game want play probably 1440 completely fine game price much value software tech ofc amd isnt reliable driver nvidia theyre way hand tailoring driver latest game dlss ofc much better amd upgraded 50 series release 7800xt stagnated software wont upgrading even aa frame gen superior tech like fps game nvidia also reflex also 40xx series efficient card ever barely take power heat compared amd card run pretty hot power
driver issue amd mostly caused user error unstable ram cpu gpu program causing conflict running amd 2 year always newest driver first 6700xt 7900 gre absolutely issue take complaint grain salt
new dlss frame gen big nvidia card 4070super thinking going 7900 xtx trying dlss 4 past couple day decided need fsr 4 looked promising ce convinced yes amd upper hand raster performance nvidia best feature set problem 12 gb vram cutting bit close 1440p think driver issue stuff bit exaggerated amd card though also 4070 super okay ray tracing card something cant get amd path traced cyberpunk playable around 100 fps edit also got oled recently rtx hdr super resolution video nice thing watch anime nice viewing experience
6800xt user 25 year havent real issue experience basically flawless need nvidia feature buy nvidia dont buy amd dont think complicated youll get performance vram money amd product side pretty much flawless driver experience day
bit 400 4070 super basically 40004200 ish
mobo cooler wan na futureproof incase im getting 9800x3d 7800x3d later used market
basically finally someone responded doubting amd finally someone said user cant set soft amd card
see thank
get cheaper motherboard cheaper cooler 750w power supply 7900xt even put price give way performance fantastic 1440p
x3d chip power hungry use less power 7600x decent motherboard handle either cpu happily decent motherboard like asrock b650 pro r wifi msi pro b650s much cheaper
pretty much yeah
ill think thanks
good thing like modifying setting stuff
much make sure know oc tune card left stock there problem oc undervolt great find right spot stable
replace hdd ssd id upgrade cpu gpu also depends motherboard ram look good could opt 3600mhz youd see minimal gain ssd really gon na wake pc
replace cpu faster one replace hdd sdd like beerbooby said 3080ti fine newer gsames
using pc game resolution cpu choice odd cpu cooler way overkill cant provide better recommendation without knowing plan use pc
change cpu mobo ram am5ddr5
youre going want invest am5 least
hi isthmus mainly looking streamgame high definition without worrying performance issue mainly play valorant lol marvel rival looking get cyberpunkbaldurs gate type game
hi vidimo anything would recommend chance
ahh sound good really sure difference look
high definition mean 1080p 1440p 4k game definitely want strong cpu even still 5800x bit overkill site offer 5700x3d would best gaming probably fine could probably get much cheaper air tower cooler aio selected anything thermalright great offer dark rock pro deepcool noctua also great brand could also look am5 build 7600x idea take price range regardless build am4 am5 want 32gb ram build quality 16gb doesnt really cut anymore especially want stream ddr4 want 3600mhz ram go am5 ddr5 ram want 6000mhz
1080p likely would like play game high setting stream maybe around 1080p httpswwwpcspecialistcoukcomputersamdam5pchttpswwwpcspecialistcoukcomputersamdam5pc using build pc see others also suggested go am5 however option cpu httpsprntsc5cfgcwqijpnahttpsprntsc5cfgcwqijpna cooler option httpsprntscl4kotfudqqgrhttpsprntscl4kotfudqqgr
honestly 1080p gpu overkill could drop xx70 tier still smash 1080p without issue
also drop aio 240mm one go named one rather pc specialist version isnt certain source aios last thing want aio leaking inside system 360mm one hugely overkill
using site mobile huge pita tell think best option 7700x am5 5700x3d am4 price see want use doesnt break bank either cpu would fine 250w rated air tower cooler offer want 240ml aio thats fine well dont like personally either way like said definitely want 32gb ram well make sure priced 1080p gaming anything honestly fine depending pricing could anything 7700xt 4070 happy
would allow maintain around 300400fps playing valorantlol streaming

issue big deal issue quite common iirc indicates certain thing pcie interconnect system said defective graphic card nothing halfpins connector submit warranty claim
aio may dead simply shifted cleaned pc need buy new thermal paste remove remove clean thermal paste isopropyl alcohol cooler cpu reapply paste put cooler back ensuring tightly pressed cpu even cooler visually look like cpu gap poor contact really bad thermal doesnt help aio may shot hear water moving would assume still working
yeah thought heard water moving booted im hearing rattling kind sound im leaning towards dead pump think still thermal paste laying around definitely try reseating cooler first though
reapplied thermal paste put cooler back sadly difference still hear rattling pump must dead bit annoying anything weird dy like
ye honestly wait 5070 global release get wait global release price drop
got im going dig bit whats better arkascended pretty much play day
really dont wan na wait get 7900xtx lol
5070 less performance 4070 ti super 5070ti probably 5 10 better maybe
hear fomo right ill control wait little longer haha
im mean im tied intel amd think xtx better
there benchmark yet u cant say sure
honesty yeah everything overpriced right due 40 series stopping production 50 series coming find good deal fb market would take bought 4070 ti super december 750 brand new 3 fan definitely better cooling overclocking lol
4070ti super worse ray tracing amd upscaling worse nvidias significantly raw power xtx even better 4080 super certain game care ray tracing much stick nvidia im somebody doesnt care much performance impact much much better looking game situation
tell spec itll barely 4080 also 4070 ti super chip 4080 flash bios strix oc gain 128 power limit beat 4080 super certain game 1fps less
dlls4 10 better 4070 ti super game example cyberpunk 4070ti super highest setting ray tracing go 7580 fps 5070 non ti cuz cant find 8793fps ray tracing look better
know getting dlss4 right also probably adding mfg obviously fr
1 aio expensive sure want 2 ditch 1 tb drive add storage later 3 get better ram cheaper 6000 mhzcl30 pick cheapest one think look good 4 cheaper case available want saving able bump gpu 7900gre find one 4070tis
honestly id ditch aio nzxt 360 kraken elite thing aios pricey purely aesthetic flex im sure price tag kraken picked worth aesthetic gain really want aio arctic brand good id also ditch rgb ram unless specific look mind
agree point also want mention isnt building march may want wait perhaps try get 5070 one 9070s release hard know pricing performance look like launch obviously
thank feedback air cooler would recommend
thank feedback case would suggest
peerless assassin phantom spirit
lian li lancool case great think 217 fantastic really easy build great airflow arent cheapest also corsair 4000d h6 flow fractal pop case quite popular want something bit cheaper stuff like montech x3 mesh phanteks xt pro good option well

ever get vram error thats indicative problem inherent 13th 14th gen intel processor thats likely one reason people tell buy nonintel cpu peaking 100c certainly concerning
get crystaldisk test storage
need go find error somewhere log havnt seen specific error pop noticeably anywhere error popup like ive seen failed create resource texture path exile 2 thats game specific issue dont know relevant

ah ctds followed error happens rarely entire browser close thats like every week happenstance game closing happens multiple time day
sold ps5 earlier month im going back console anytime soon
ps5 game bought last year ff7 rebirth thats pc ps5 game ill get year probably ghost yotei pc right powerful ps5 although cpu might behind keep
gpu fine maybe upgrade motherboard ram cpu
something wrong diagnosis 3070 totally fine anything check temp normally conduct maintenance system cpu ram
playing 4k cause able hold high graphic 3070 sound pretty unrealistic ive got i3 12th gen paired rx 6600 run everything high setting 1080p maybe need cleaning cpu cooling check idk sounding pretty strange ps5 way worse build maybe considering ps5 pro itd fair comparison even id upgrade
game specifically struggling ps5 less powerfulthan reuse component upgrade mobocpuram gpu sell old stuff reuse case ssdhddpsufansetc also 3070 still really capable today issue probably cpu modern game cpu intensive
cpu cooler could need checking 8gb vram little lacking 1440p might set til next year new gpu supposedly 5070 might beat 3070
stated cpu i9 2019 im exactly sure im work could check get home 32gb ram know isnt issue
realize powerful appreciate response knowing ill upgrade motherboardchip see performance go still slacking ill save gpu
advantage console know theyre optimizing console pc gpu inside psu closer 2070ti2080 gpu basically rx6700xt think 3070 isnt crazy powerful better13 average plus pc lower graphic push ps5 get 1 2 option cpu ps5 basically 3700x i512400f exactly pretty damn close
dont know youre usa could probably sell 3070 250300 fb marketplace buy 3080ti 400500 itd big upgrade 3080ti still like top 7 gpus today
im u buy 3080 price im suspicious buying used
used market place buy 3080ti arent made anymore always buy ebay get buyer protection purchase warranty youre gon na pay lot card trick identifying good used card product pretty robust even used mining probably wouldnt impact several year
150 less 7950x3d plenty id go honestly intel isnt even option right gaming pc worse price performance higher power draw temp plus lack upgradeability give almost zero advantage mid high end gaming pc
would love know seeing 7950x3d 450 usd lol cost double even u
stay away 13th 14th gen intel desktop cpu
think would future proof sense upgrade 7080 8080 future 7950x3d wont bottleneck gpu
im happy u case
""
mean there chance way knowing quickly gpu technology advance time frame overall especially 4k resolution guess still perfectly capable cpu work fine one gpus 3d v cache give quite longevity may get highest frame rate possible 4k 60fps gaming id say safely assume still problem 45 year
double wrong still around 759 right dont see economics make sense anywhere able buy silicon 150 less power annoying troubleshoot core parking behavior sometimes point guess would get 7950 save 150
13th 14th gen cpu problem cpu degrades fast fails desktop cpu expensive replace one dy defective laptop cpu dont problem good
alright ill probably go 7950x3d case extra core always nice 150 dollar saved even nicer
yeah ill take 7950x3d
mouthful shouldve said fractal pop silent fractal design company pop product line mini variant product line silent another variant product line case loud silent version airflow fan work harder keep cool dont spinning drive 99 time actually quieter get case hole hole better airflow gon na fry gpu pulling hot air case nah fine
90 especially stress testing fine really cooling doesnt matter unless actually running thermal limit like 95 system thermally throttling really doesnt matter
dead silent full load usually gpu taking beating run really quiet dual fan rtx 3060 ti fe main concern cpu running 90 degree stock cooler added wammy buzzy bastard xd put aio intake itll run fine gpu wont hot
hmm true im kinda wary degrading part despite knowledge fact part made run hot virtually forever dont want i3s thermal cap warp gpu die go like lot gpus time really run temp like play minecraft distant horizon shaders put load system cinebench
yup
ok thanks reassuring
thanks mate much appreciated
yep everything work fine made change interested 150buvks cheaper httpspcpartpickercomlistqmrxnp
thats getting performance want current build upgrade youre probably fine cant hurt wait see benchmark well
wait benchmark performance difference lot less think
disappointment shitwreck 5080 around 30 faster 4070 ti question youd satisfied kind performance increase
white card always decent markup may hard find one launch reasonable price
overall im mostly satisfied get frame drop cyberpunk occasionally fortnite think thats fortnite fortnite biggest irk stupidly black card white build huge deal want able keep whatever decide next 45 year thinking 12gb vram 16gb would worth difference really dont know much
ive never held release day card going get benchmark sale right seems like buying 4080 super around 1000 anyway 1200ish want white one feel bit bottlenecked 12gb vram title though
dont think jump 12gb vram 16gb would make much difference
also think reality price new 5 series card much higher nvidia made msrp rtx3xxx 4xxx gpus started appear used market good price could good time purchase previous generation card 4080 included
would improvement case youre limited 12gb vram future proofing theory 16gb would better state game development day hard guess anything card might start running raw performance vram becomes limiting factor
yes looked first right cant really find white 4080 super less 1100 ive trying convince white 5080 going 121500 anyway wonder much difference go 4070 ti 4080 super v 4060 ti 5080
literally discussion last night friend regarding performance newer card might enough newest game highest setting could easily big issue
likely much power outage computer perspective
there power applied switch hit pin jumped
almost definitely youre okay flipping switch best practice almost circumstance one time completely fine edit also messed probably wouldnt start
computer couldnt care less since powered unplug computer wall protect electric shock youre protecting computer
whew make sense make feel lot better silly needed flip psu switch everything seems running well thanks taking time answer
dont think there anything wrong hdd choice seagate good choice failing western digital also good psu used thishttpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist site made build served well
also thinking corsair ax1600i price concrete changing 11k bgn
follow sacred tier list linked seasonic typically good stuff also want say 1600w total overkill anything outside 40905090 build could get something low 1000w fine 1200w safe get bigger one want nothing wrong im letting know
thought many time pesky gpu sooooo power hungry want safe future upgrade long term
another thought nonmodular power supply easy find modular one much easier work
cant clock cpu h series board even could gain would minimal nonexistent harm trying enable xmp
yes enable xmp overclocking come cooling board allows

spec build pcpartpicker get estimated wattage 7800x3d b580 550w would enough
good thing havent bought anything yet id highly recommend going completely different spec
2nd pc part picker see popular particular part popular something resource youll find help understand install part case really personal preference thing aim something popular save headache building also aim mid size large overkill thing fit future upgrade dont buy micro size unless youre feeling confident air cooler im guessing youre aiming budget fan cheapereffective pc part picker also noise rating pick something people buy fine start picking color want narrow psu make sure pick something slightly higher need need 550 get 650 watt
ok thanks man
pls tell tho im kinda new scemce dont wan na something stupid
spec fine
invest gpu less cpu dont need 450 cpu keep 400 b580 go ryzen 5 7600 185 put whopping 265 save gpu bringing gpu budget 665 550 get rtx 5070 performance rtx 4090
mean setup handle monitor sure simpler game 1660 super powerful enough modern aaa game enough vram underpowered get anywhere close 240fps league counterstrike ya probably could get 240fps could check game currently uncap everything see fps get
depending setting dont think youll see 240 fps league youre planning using monitor could good choice
really play league legend wan na maximize smoothness since plan replacing current monitor run 60hz wan na know hz monitor suit best setup
check fps game dont cap refresh rate monitor
yeah earlier first 30 sec give 200fps get lower stabalizes anywhere 90130fps im wondering ill get 220 fps replace monitor 240hz one
thats work youll get 200fps nothing happening 100ish fighting
get smoother gameplay replace current monitor higher hz rate shitty one currently
144hz monitor time youd never notice difference 60100hz monitor youd notice although shitty 144hz monitor there perhaps benefit 240hz one
hertz fps basically mean thing buddy upgrading monitor wont make fps go allow monitor actually display frame getting example 60 hz monitor get 60 fps mean monitor refreshes screen 60 time second get 60 fps computer actually able see 60 frame computer creating monitor show get 120 fps monitor 60hz even computer trying create 120 frame second show monitor still able refresh picture 60 time second still show 60 frame upgrade monitor something show 144hz example able see 120 frame second monitor refresh picture often pc new frame show upgrading monitor increase fps 120 old monitor actually see 120 frame second make sense
guess think worth getting new monitor fps remains im literally trying understand work lol
fps frame per second hertz number refreshes per second computer idea monitor plugged going create number fps regardless plugged monitor plugged right actually show 60 frame per second refreshed 60 time per second upgrade monitor 240hz screen refresh 240 time per second allow see 240 frame per second increase many frame computer actually creating case league currently run around 120fps actually see double frame make feel twice smooth would need upgrade pc gpu cpu ram get better fps new monitor could show 240fps computer stronger idk else explain man
appreciate effort basically current pc setup may fail achieve higher fps whole thing confusing idk gpucpu problem monitor co also talked someone told setup shouldnt problem running 140fps lol although told may good idea upgrade monitor
psu using
dont use power strip id probably look psu first since cheap psu take whole pc
power pc directly outlet know power strip cause
power strip suppose possibility pretty unlikely rest machine ie monitor doesnt turn still always try without power strip dy without power strip problem power strip insufficientdefective power supply andor defective motherboard far likely problem
die screen go black force restart computer turn may want make sure cpu cooler clogged dust crashing issue recently since replacing stock cooler hyper 212 could honestly cleaned temp 60c idle worth checking temp power cord psu stock noticed lot replacement one ebay sufficient gauge 300w another possibility
power strip isnt hot warm probably isnt would chck temperature cpu gpu pc low power even psu problem questionable
wasnt actually one building pc dont know
thing 2 outlet 1 used internet
pc 1 year old really hope motherboard psu arent problem
monitor pc turn
tested turned 75 c
single outlet use one
dont need internet test game
thats basically reason warranty exist thing expected fail within warranty period event motherboard andor psu defective oneyear warranty manufactured didnt expect live much longer event hardware defective still covered warranty manufacturer expected part last long warranty period knew shit happens sometimes get replacement expense
yea checked actually problem power stripe guess buy triple socket use internet monitor one pc
found quiet system power 10b 750w 80 bronze
extension cord electronics turn pc
decent unit always defective
power strip capacity 3000 w definitely chinese lie monitor connected well pc thats think couldnt handle hard game like tlou
dunno monitor pc cant draw 300w either bad power strip broken test somehow
well dont really want dig since found cause problem haha im pretty sure bad got dollar store xd
yeah never buy questionable extennsions powerstrips similar
httpspcpartpickercomlistkssf4p go theoretically though could upgrade old cpu 5700x3d get 4080 super stick old pc
dont need
msi b650 gaming plus wifi
thank
id upgrade cpu id upgrade gpu im honest 2080ti still hold quite decently
psu
would good idea get win11 win10 stop getting update cpu supported youll likely need update cpumoboram
seasonic focus gx 1000w gold
thanks thats figured ive got little bit time least
youre good 5080
i9 9900k support window 11 unless apps break window 11 upgrade o get 5080 swap cpumotherboard ram later convenient
ill mess around update today maybe reading something wrong
thanks checking enable tmp 20 im good go
sound like either bios setting configured properly usb creator tool m make bootable win11 usb installer work properly able provide list spec pc screenshots bios boot menu
u actually run creation tool put win11 usb

generated file microsoft website downloaded copied flash usb need anything else beside sorry im super noob whole process
yes download usb creator herehttpswwwmicrosoftcomenussoftwaredownloadwindows11 called create window 11 installation medium run installer follow prompt ask select usb flash drive download latest version win11 copy usb make bootable done confirm work verifying usb drive name esdusb open see win11 install filesfolders flash drive ready proceed install win11 new pc
watch video guide making boot usb see youve missed anything
thank noobie didnt even download right file yes exactly like pointed done first successful pc build installation knock wood there issue future
file usb look anything like one video im seeing youtube ill try get back update
ok
simple fix haha actually downloaded entirely different thing right next medium creation tool one thank bunch double checking
lol glad got end
issue keep upgrade gpu instead cpu still good enough
youre right next list anyways thanks
would say 7900x since core better rendering tho watt usage 7900x way higher 9700x 170w v 65w budget psu handle would say 7900x better choice
thanks think extra performance 7900x worth additional 105w
hmm idk thats acl question asked thread got told another company china released better opan source gpus less expensive new gen wait buy new gpu yeah cant help would say take gpu vram since rendering need alot also clock speed kinda important think since depend long rendering take yeah 5070 12gb tho new gddr7 ram 7900x 20gb older gddr6 ram 7900xt wider bus 320bit compared 192bit speed gddr7 def higher 28gbps compared 20gbps gddr6 tho would use bottleneck calculator see card work better cpu think little hard since new 50 series yet amd pride perfect work together tech amd work best amd could see leap forward 7900xt tho idk long willing wait prb take new 50 series get released see benchmark precise benchmark cpu gpu work good enough would wait benchmark new 50 series decide maybe even worth wait new 8000 series amd gpu supposed launch end year idk much ab
nvm new china gpu ai model supposed way better openai one
ill probably stick nvidia research work well blender adobe software amd gpus im planning get 5070 ti 5070 need 16 gb yes im waiting benchmark let see happens
ooh yeah yeah 5070ti would prb better choice yes wait benchmark review
lmao im sorry wrote ab gpus tho u wanted know smth ab cpu misread yeah like said core better since rendering us multi core would benefit core idk ur budget afford would acl say either 7900x 9900x bc 9900x 7900x mostly tho newer 9900x us 50w less 50bucks would benefit higher boost base clock compared 9700x tho 9900x cost ab 437 9700x 362 least germany psu money would choose 9900x also easier cool also consider 9900x need 120w cooled rather 170w 7900x short depends budget cooling psu capacity choose ryzen 9 core higher tdp ryzen 7 lower performance also way less tdp
lol thats fine thought didnt much say cpu mentioned gpu budget 7900x 70 difference 9900x india never noticed 9900x tdp 120w ill consider im finalizing thing finalized 9900x time ill start feeling like shouldnt go 7950x 70 ive come far already
well yeah tho 7950x cost 70 9900x idk worth 170w 16 core 32 thread crazy think ab 500 buck still alot money clock isnt much faster 10 ghz def notice rather notice 16cores 16mib l2 cache instead 12 others tho like said idk worth extra 70 buck 4 core tiny clock boost ofc best rendering purpose prb better 500 buck well afford sure go tho cool power also idk ab ram much planning getting ddr5 kind expensive newer 9000x cpu handle 5600mhz ram 192gb rather 192gb 5200mhz make much difference cant say tho
64gb enough think idk need probably ill start 32gb mobo would u recommend 7900x 9900x
use integrated graphic
wait new series today western world got punched face china newest open source ai model par better premium chatgpt o1 model exponentially cheaper operate way efficient nvidia took nosedive would significantly reduce demand gpus meaning dont rush im expecting 5090s sold long
wait new gen
alr thanks ill consider
point would im also building new 9700x system using 3060 ti already compelling upgrade option come along
hm alright tho see afford new gen
5070 would likely ideal finger crossed good stock msrp variant
yeah alr ill look thanks
general rule wait least every 5 year 3 generation newer last build lasted 7 year
personally im upgrading soon i7 4770 rx 580 time im spending around 1800 euro total clean white 1440p build play anything spending 2000 gpu alone sound crazy people much money guess haha ur pc still let u play anything u upgrade u could always upgrade ur gpu like 4060 something like get another year higher setting whatever feel good u
youre good low enjoy like good graphic oled ultra wide neither wrong
typically every 46 year need gpu power
upgrade whenever extra cash want sometimes part hobby tinkering system thats ok financially something afford ok spend money lot hobby spend much said dont want waste money upgrade whenever cant play game want setting like fomo shouldnt reason upgrade dont swayed marketing behind latest greatest
completely agree even rx 580 run basically game new one low setting pretty well
singleplayer game eye candy get immersion experience otherwise hell want tv excellent picture logic quite flawed world 2k gpu required play high setting 1440p monitor thats money burn
current pc want old pc lasted 10 year 970 gtx granted stronger gaming laptop old pc current laptop w 4060 still could run game like cyberpunk satisfaction im upgrading whole thing
every 67 year
im running i76700k 2080 wasnt planning upgrading time soon picked path exile 2 really like game game like system dont usually play lot new game never really run performance issue bad think might time upgrade soon
4 year gpu cpu depends upgrade make big difference 5800x much leap 9800x3d going curious see amd gpus
mobo o longer supported game play
usually like 2 year probably
think people care performance graphic something like new final fantasy rebirth get way higher fps 4090 2060 super even higher setting game optimization complete trash day make game harder run think make sense people upgrading especially people enjoy aaa game use computer job requires high demanding workload got ta remember people play esports title designed run many system possible furthermore people like use computer run multiple application like ob vtuber rig lot benefit running game pc console im betting lot people want game run look better console especially console evolved generation new p xbox pretty much budget computer btw im rocking high end pc either probably wont upgrade im saying get people would want latest hardware sometimes think pc little better id able run game 60fps
1 spare money 2 relay need upgrade maybe app need something dont etc 3 upgrade give min 50 faster ideally want double speed cpu tend age well tend keep cpu long time gpus want min 50 fps gpu upgrade work percentage upgrade fps hitting 60fps setting use 25 faster 15 fps 75fps small upgrade 50 faster 30 fps 90fps ok thats ok upgrade 75 faster 45 fps 105fps thats nice upgrade 100 faster 60 fps 120fps worth upgrading blown away upgrade sub 60fps setting using less 50fps tiny 25 upgrade take 62fps saying drop setting game hit fps target id rather lower graphic today wait longer get massive gpu upgrade later
want upgrade im reddit dont want upgrade im actually enjoying pc
5700x rocked 2070 oc 12gb long time 1440 monitor 165hz 2msecond refresh upgraded 4070ti super oc 16gb noticeable jump visual quality cost 1100 cad plus tax included game star war outlaw plan use am4 system least five seven year time worth yeah dont pay 2k 5090 game unless pro
recently upgraded 5900x 9800x3d eek power 3090 also get ddr5 knowing am5 supported least 2 year
cpu least every socket socket generation lga 1151 went am5 super long wait lol gpu every 3 generation often hunt last gen used price
also agree id rather pay 200 play low setting fps drop pay 3000 best dont even play much lived computer might better one
game want play running good patient gamer wait game special patch bug fix dlc around 20 get year upgrade never go top end last upgrade ryzen 5600x gtx 1080 ryzen 7800x3d rtx 4070ti reason bought 5600x old i5 4690k motherboard shit bed last upgrade feel spent much money gone ryzen 5800x3d rather platform upgrade
build best computer afford every use 710 year start 3rd build ever hopefully 5090
upgrade whenever urge strike sometimes year im interested hardware time ill upgrade upgrade month later im usually aiming midhigh setting 1080p 100fps latest aaa game usually get current mid range hardware law diminishing return set plus there much choice level good deal found highend stuff doesnt interest even though could certainly afford small gain image quality dont justify price increase offense anybody id feel like chump thats
upgrade year 6 year gpu want itch build new pc also im tired stutter modern game 8gb vram isnt enough thing arent improving optimisation gaming point im accepting ive lost fight also mean take old pc lounge use console replacement game still run well hopefully 9070 xt priced well neither gpu ryzen shortage issue
upgraded 5700x3d wouldnt spend whole new platform hopefully get another 35 year really wan na upgrade gpu
30805800x plan upgrade later yearearly next year build including 5080
waay often im trying slow
something finally give
normally upgrade gpu every generation made exception going nvidia 30 series 40 series get higher efficiency less heat less fan noise dlss frame gen im thinking upgrading gpu 60 series least upgrade cpu based gpu need bargain example im using 12600k right found 13th 14th gen k processor 150 less id grab extend life platform another 4 year
im upgrading cpu soon want bit headroom game game getting bit demanding
well want able play anything 60fps max graphic 1080p 2060 even 3060 would enough recent game example tried mh wild open beta 2060 could reach 60fps without monster looking like polygon 4060 card similar strenght needed high setting 60fps recent game medium ok 3060 general 30 series ok
upgrade ask current computer want pc want dont upgrade like rt feature cyberpunk 2077 upgrade 5800x 4070 super last year since run everything want thing think make want replace setup witcher 4 probably 3ish year away
update every yearish usually skip generation alternating gpu cpu try anyways 4670k2700x58005800x3dwill grab 9800x3d stock isnt issue 780ti 10701080ti30804080s upgraded 4080s kid pc needed gpu price figured ill grab 4080s justify 4k oled
tell friend put 100 month separate bank account balance reach whatever youre willing spend upgrade start shopping something blow get broken money replace
also always say graphic overrated couldnt powerful pc see game running max reminded make huge difference experience dont go bankrupt important grand scheme human visual creature
like enjoy game 1080 60 low setting tyvm
probably would upgrade pc coming 45 year old done time point dont really play super intense aaa game im mainly esports gamer pretty much monster hunter junkie thats far go would often upgrading like decently modern budget build
could get 5700x3d alixpress cheap vendor hundred sale going 4070 4080 used new gpus come work 3080 thirsty power could worth wait used price squish amd nvidia card
depends play get horizon forbiden went high slightly modified w21351080 setup reliably get 60fps area giving 40 fps still playable looking upgrade w22454070 soon give bit life replacing recycled workstation pc new build
play ultra wide upgrade
youre satisfied performance youre getting
upgrade whenever feel like game reduce quality play decent framerate also play console series x ps5 came delayed upgrade played console best bang buck save super good game look gorgeous upgraded pc though upgraded month catching backlog
microcenter run combo deal cant pas
went 1080ti 3080ti gon na wait line 5090 idk
yuh honestly agree upgraded 12700kintegrated graphic 4080 super7700x idek ill probably upgrade 9090 smth stupid come
generally upgrade something big dy simple really
logic flawed op gaming experience subjective u graphic important others arent valid experience view love people argue someone elses subjective experience enjoy graphic theyre part package immersion make part fun dont need good graphic enjoy experience thats thats good wont argue need good graphic enjoy gaming personally find interesting loudly doth protest graphic mattering everytime new series gpu drop
feel like hardware holding back something frequently come barrier new game cant run smoothly even low setting
upgrade computer isnt running thing would like run performance satisfied sometimes reason though upgraded ryzen 3600 5700x3d recently know want stay am4 platform thinking another 56 year dont want spend money essentially full system upgrade foreseeable future figured 3600 probably wont give performance want longevity want took advantage sale microcenter felt like reasonable use money wasnt necessarily unhappy 3600 performance right planning future people lot extra money spend like cutting edge upgrade every couple year thats average person though seems like youre satisfied setup far gaming go better spec absolutely look nicer perform smoothly thats fact dont care play game want play dont need upgrade right
upgraded 3600 5800x3d make cs2 run smoother also 2060super see reason upgrade upgrade feel give big performance boost sake
upgrade start dropping setting medium low play latest game
5600x well upgraded 5800x3d bumped ram 32gb upgraded 3060 ti 7900xt game 1440p easily dont fear next 23 year game
new monster hunter gta game come destroy gpu 78 year
trying max hardware id probably go console generation route upgrade every 7 year upgrading 30 series 700 series 2027 upgrading 60 series
buy latest time purchasebuilding pc use around 45 year 2nd cycle never felt need upgrade add part
mostly 67 year sweet spot upgrade feel like need cant fulfilled current setup

whenever thing arent fast enough setting like 5ish year
gpu always skip 2generation mobo ram n cpu 67yrs
start plan upgrade cant play new game like decent setting
start thinking upgrading get double performance price
going 12 year current build still play game decent performance relative im working im finishing 9800x3dtaichi build currently though hoping 5090 week im doubtful
get flagship gpu every 2 generation like play everything max setting youre right playing 1080p still similar experience im sort person get disproportionate amount joy sens like good headphone good tv monitor even good restaurant reckon similar reason experiencing something lookssoundstastes incredible brings lot happiness general saying 1080p fine like saying bowl rice bean good enough meal still give nourishment get definitely people feel way happy spend money chase exceptional sensory experience

im upgrading next month purely simply cpu isnt window 11 compatible 10 eol already 3080 9800x3d nvme x 2 64gb 6000mhz cl30 sparkly light white bit
rx 5700 xt 9000 series intel upgrading year
good reason fund 2000 dollar 5090 aint bad move
used flush thousand toilet making sure bleeding edge like addiction rule computer phone car everything 1 broken need replacing 2 unable something need honestly even guideline place lot tech
becomes apparent gpu really struggling majority title likely stop working number reason goal make pc last least 5 7 even year anyways
like every 5 year currently r5 3600x vega 56 upgrading rx 9070xt rx 7900xt first later upgrading cpu r7 5700x3d
dont understand point youre trying make go low high like there strong argument diminishing return sometimes even lower efficiency go higher thats nothing new youve got whole spectrum people afford scoop part free others threw people wont bat eye spending 5k 10k generational upgrade
like play shooter pc cant reach 140 fps think upgrading
upgrade usually 8 10 year later motherboard start serious issue dont feel like troubleshooting anymore prospect better machine good avoid spare part still work cleaned reused new build
used part new part insane deal sold 5600x16gb ram 120 upgraded new 5700x3d 32gb ram 180 matter slice fantastic price performance upgrade similarly 2060 sold 250 got 3080 msrp launch 3080 found 350 used make way much sense someone older gpu 1440p
5 year entire system gpu upgrade every generation
2018 pc still going strong performing high setting game 1440p setup i78700k 32gb ram rtx 2080 8gb im gon na go decade use upgrading yet play game pc cant handle medhigh setting
go weird update cycle new game console come new major console new build revision gpu upgrade keep right around spot playing newer title whilst mostly playing older one
im still using 1060 plan upgrade year nearly decade current build
3 year ago bought first setup 3060 im 4070super
last setup i7 4930k though upgrade gpu 780 2080ti upgrading everything today almost post 10 year upgrading 7950x x870e platform 4080s need productivity v gaming animation stuff plus mild gaming edit awaiting gpu case arrive
upgraded 14900k 96gb ram z790 mobo 1200w power supply keeping 1080ti going strong 5090 come im gon na try snag one ill likely wait like everyone else march february replenish stock
1440p 120hz monitor hand best upgrade need hardware support fps see smooth may search youtube comparison monitor much difference let say 144 hz 120 hz 1080p 60 hz v 1440p 120 hz night day difference even see smooth mouse move screen sustain need good gpu yes free cheap indie game run 120 fps whatever want aaa game high frame thats people upgrade gpu cpu bought bottleneck gpu gaming dont need upgrade much
ha ha upgraded i74770 real reason window 10 going end life
thing compared golf could get newest flagship cpugpu everyone release still come way ahead hobby go expensive least dont btw sayin
i74770k gtx770rtx2070 think cpumobo officially done wont boot o window repair reset thing wont work 10 year definitely got money worth lol got ta decide upgrade split r5 9600x v r7 9700x completely lost mobo get
rx 570 cant even run single pcvr title without crashing upgrading 4080 super 9800x3d soon rx 570 2017 almost 10 year really good run mid range 1080p gaming pc time
yee 6700k like 8 year old haha respect tho love far old hardware last
yee got 5600x proboly going buy 5700x3d idk hard choise
sure 2070 12gb never released 8gb missing something
ye really got urge kinda spend alot improve many fps haha 1080q 5600x 5 year old chip still bad 2025 guess maybe buy 5700x3d new gen gpu midrange idk going 7500f would am5 replacement cpu something happen 7500f similar performance 5700x3d many question
true ryzen sort shortage problem tho mostly x3d chip gpu fine haha ye idk wan na upgrading gpu easy cpu tricky go am4 5 5700x3d proboly good got ta upgrade am5 point
truee maybe aswell 5700x3d pretty cheap guess last long
im riding pre covid 2070 super dy hopefully many year
yee guess maybe played much competitive game know 1080q low quality best setting best gameplay weird isnt got used 1080q maybe yee totally get point people go poor play 4k weird still rih buying 4080 super totally support
yeah think initial hardware price tag make seem inaccessible people dont think amount hour come one time investment someone saving reef tank yeah pc gaming pretty cheap lol
9700x worth get 7700x instead performance sometimes 7700x even beat 9700x
im upgrading exact cpu gpu combo currently r9 fury x 2015 awhile since ive played single player title
yeah think came 2015 trooper sure ive thought upgrading past point upgrade cpu id need new mobo match ram wouldnt compatible id need new ram point im buying whole new system would get pricey lmao
id upgrade 1080p thinking going 1440p money go better gpu 5600x enough
late model release oc model higher gb vram higher bus capacity matched 3000 series
ive always stuck jump bit ahead newest console carried build well dont immediately match new console second released development especially port typically lag behind console release new console first year release thus developer target result average hardware near window id personally going less 7800xt4070 ti super already 2060 super held well ps5 gpu usually issue gpu people usually misdiagnose cpu end replacing cpu couple year quick cpu pretty darn obvious especially cpu usage metric
think itll stable mayjune dont think good go am4 point also depends want pc work mine need decent cpu software dev also like playing competitive fps game better high framerates low gfx rely cpu play game 60 definitely go bit lower spec id still go am5
released around year ago essentially best am4 chip still buy new considering 5800x3d slightly better despite like 100200 used lol definitely think got year people still good 36005600x chip well upgraded 5600x
main inspiration upgrading gf want play sims new inzoi coming well playing demanding pcvr title im really wondering go 4080 super 7900xtx game like heavily modded skyrim hear extra vram nice nvidia pretty much everything else
6700k many year great went 5600x like 2 year ago
sure 2060 find anything internet
yep 5800x3d picture rather buy am5 point yee idk would love buying am5 would save alot go 5700x3d untill am5 component becomes cheaper maybe hmm guess skip am5 go 5700x3d think
also gave old pc gf want play sims small world way looked want longevity get 7900xtx want best versatile performance next generation 16gb vram likely wont cut get 4080s hope help
go 5700x3d definitely skip am5 thats plan
yeah help longevity big factor dont plan upgrade sims especially hungry vram dont need ray tracing ai generated frame dont play much competitive anymore 1440 100 fps gaming im going thanks
would go 6000mt cl30 ram optimal speed am5 cpu currently rest spec look good
budget new gpu located
current bottleneck havent bothered maybe get rx6600 call day also look updating bios motherboard getting r55600 r75700x3d cpu later upgrade budget country buying likely limiting factor maybe supply get better advice
need return stick want get replacement reorder refund sell kit stick bin matched fully compatible
would even get refund without returning entire kit
hurt dualquadchannel keyword max performance want 2 4 stick exception
there point dont need 3 slot filled reason long past
ah multi time day question mixing kit bad idea
hurt eat ram keep cheap
hurt huurrrrttttttt hart heeaaarrrrtttt hurt heart 3stick bad 2stick good pc simple good
time would help running program explicitly need ram system outside actually slow computer example loading multi gb file using python needed ram process efficientlycouldnt process line line load 40gb data ram scenario unusual dont code work large data set keep stick spare ever run ram state use
others said need return answer anyway would help 161616 run flex mode given system 25 year old something 32gb run dual rest single channel thats far better running 32gb dual relying page file rest way page file always used youre really ram full time one issue put strain memory controller also 4 stick might lead needing reduce frquency p help there need extra ram like caching usage otherwise obviously really
ordered pair shoe one fucked would return bad one
dont know live ram need amazon several 6000 cl30 kit example today tomorrow something like order pay new kit return busted kit credit day new one arrives january 28 two day safety cushion either way dont run mismatched stick dont run three stick thats budget survive watching tv touching grass day two
even though one stick defective im still gon na right thing return stick live without computer like 4 day
dont know lol barely check stuff return guess right thing would return find next day delivery new kit fell shafted though wont sale price go rebuy would technically losing money
wont run flex mode 32gb dual 16gb single channel thats far better 32gb dual pagefile one issue might appear longer possible run frequency might need downclock
usually fine tho ive mixed nothing happened thousand post ive seen never really remember anyone issue
would 3 stick identical ram wouldnt mixing many pointed 3 stick good idea ill keep backup end keeping
guess live without computer day replacement arrives
well due vote got trying keep good stick ram multi billion dollar company im gon na return stick got money back one next day delivery would lost sale price got kit mobo backorder till day ago wait month build pc part got cyber monday black friday return date jan 31st saved get part wait month finally build guess thought enjoying new gaming pc couple day without like week clouded judgement
30 day something return wait send back refund dont thief
cant request replacement instead return
downclocks aint gon na faster smart guy
usually though sub tech support filled question like last one mere hour ago someone mixing 16gb 8gb lo behold 16gb recognized
hi one remembering issue 1 personal gaming rig two set speed latency still wouldnt run xmp boardscpus 2 work updated around 40 thinkpafs 8gb 24gb since 16gb stick price 8 7 ram error melodie ticket since switching laptop 816 88 1616 resolved note except one fault intermittent eg thinkpafs run ram issue every boot like every 3rd cold boot
3 stick kit dont exist anymore meaning youre mixing set 2 1 module set 2 regardless identical spec still mixing kit memory sold kit reason manufacturer tested performance stability module kit mix kit result go window along system stability performance
part came super late due back order return date jan 31st
item supposed arrive return date mean wont working computer return stick day
said might need need smar guy even downclock actually us extra ram gain performance depends cpu current frquency tho either way downclock lose pretty much nothing noticible
well mileage may differ tho shouldnt result one recognized rezult stable outright booting dont get wrong im saying good practice usually end fine issue instability tho ive seen people issue theyre mixing thats based luck
1 xmp guaranteed run either way stick put load imc thats even less likely overclock run 2 likely laptop error ram faulty size ram doesnt anything stability putting ram size also doesnt matter modern motherboard able fully utilize flex mode situation like 816 already accounted likely poor quality thinkpad sincenit unable work flex mode said im saying impossible problem rare doesnt relate ram work motherboard cpu play crucial role
ran issue ddr4 first came didnt really money front new kit refund like 250 good 16gb kit time fucked around single stick awhile terrible return take day gon na suck youll much happier come like second christmas year exchange replacement sale price 100 best option cant borrow ankit friend get one local store return bit
1 agreed 2 would theorise running flex mode bit demanding imc thus little prone produce error
2 yeah thats case theory put slot imc get work size dont match bit work ideally 1 stick able run fastest sacrifising dual channel result far less performance

shouldnt update bios x870 mobo support 9800x3d httpswwwgigabytecommotherboardx870gamingxwifi7supportsupportcpu cpu supported f1 oldest bios version like every cpu want update bios newest version use utility bios building
use q flash httpsyoutubelrwp29lyqi
interesting benefit updating
may optimized performance patched security vulnerability newer version want update though dont need building using qflash plus via utility bios youll get feedback monitor better going flashing light back mobo imo
thank probably building mind
14900kf usually little faster 9900x unusual usecase running 20 instance old game hard say one end better 5600x handle way 5600x didnt last 6 year maybe wont either
5600x ok since bought around 2021 offline online game guy decide enough time make change since buy better last longer old game case handle around 10 page perfectly
sound like 20 reasonable goal dont know faster sure else expected say replied curious guess 14900kf downside much higher power consumption electricity cooling needed potentially expensive power supply motherboard think 150 cheaper itd still better buy 7900x also fast 9900x

could get pcie ethernet card lot cheaper whole new motherboard
didnt thought recommendation
something keep track make sure modern generation one older one read review buying know youre getting something decent
maybe ram wasnt way finally came loose thats usually go video problem seems strange
tried reseating ram couple time one stick two four seems alright im worried graphic card broken smth stupid expensive country
integrated graphic would take gpu test mobo output give definite answer
cpu cooling since want use fan radiator need good static pressure least thats gathered different review generally isnt necessary since modern fan almost fairly good static pressure airflow certainly dont need specific sp fan since aio rad general thick restrictive fan work fine case need good airflow im search kind good balance static pressure airflow rgb modern fan offer balance work us dont niche situation dont require niche solution spec wise impressive amature eye spec 100 speed realistic way people run fan dont mean whole lot likely arent relevant people buy whichever fan think look best check box dont overthink 10 fan difference unlikely matter
cpu cooling buy 9800x3d least thats plan get saying beeing necessary review see 457 degree difference since want get hand 5090 lol want good fan overall cpu seems 5090 push lot hot air im kinda scared cpu need know could range budget keep cool haha
9800x3d cooled 40 air cooler fine 360mm aio overkill allow minimal noise 7c thermal overhead going going change performance longevity cpu seems 5090 push lot hot air im kinda scared cpu safe temp matter youre already planning using dump truck haul 5lb bag sand exaggerated isnt concern especially 10 fan need know could range budget keep cool haha youre building top end really shouldnt budget considering much extra spending little performance get return mention youre getting 10 fan mate even hottest pc reasonably cooled 46 decent case arent running 100 speed there reason splitting hair spec 100 speed sp v af meaningless twice many fan need begin dont overthink currently overthinking
thanks man help alot know
decent afford slightly higher cost id like httpspcpartpickercomlistppsf4p afford cost id maybe spring 7600 xt 16gb vram help gpu age lot better price going high regular 8gb also work
httpspcpartpickercomlistywtyvf cpu available newegg slightly expensive amd newer platform cpu noticeably faster gpu faster decent margin especially include raytracing upscaling feature xess
much would upgrade suggested run im comfortable going extra 50 buck give take
saying already ddr4 32gb ram wouldve preferred keep think worth buying ddr5s though could
well total pcpp 721 usd pretax id say fit worth taking especially ssd cpu change anything gpu difficult 7600 xt brings 771 pretax
well id say worth still sell ram amd newer platform dont buy new motherboard ram easily upgrade cpu later something like 7800x3d 9800x3d would say worth
ig thats much better performance
ig make sense much would ram sell used abt year
depends ram really cheap one something like silicon power gskill aegis ram probably around 30 buck expensive one like gskill trident z probably around 50
corsair vengeance lpx 32 gb ddr4 3600mhz cl18
would go ebay facebook marketplace try sell 3999
alrighty thx everything

narrow color sort price 4080 super similar performance 7900 xtx significantly expensive httpspcpartpickercomproductsvideocardhttpspcpartpickercomproductsvideocard
could wait aib 5080 otherwise youll probably going 7900xtx 4080s card hard come across nowadays
wait month get 5080 cant wait need 4090 honestly budget high id likely take step get 5090 7900xtx nice 4090 surpasses practically everything especially raytracing
thank everyone
76007600x proven adequate way 4090 might squeeze fps better cpu basically burning money point use saving cpu buy better gpu
yes
yup youre good might edge case performance good matter limiting factor
yes im running 3950x 4070 ti super great typically get 100 utilization nvidia gpu
run 7600x 7900gre 1440p run fantastic youll even better
dont worry bottleneck modern component long somewhat generation youll fine 7600x 1080p get like 600 fps valorant game
wont bottleneck game wouldnt worry went 7900x 9800x3d radeon 7900xtx game little difference game ran way faster already fast big performance increase game like insurgency sandstorm minecraft marvel guardian galaxy etc
im currently running r5 3600 4070 super primarily play sea thief zero issue im sure setup would work fine
many people said yes confirm personal experience 7600x 4070ti super play 1440p ultrawide great combo havent single issue game ive played far get 200 fps valorant 150 marvel rival thats max graphic turn graphic bit youll likely reach goal least two
yes easily went 7700x got lot headroom 7800xt 1440p wanted eight core future though
yes go resolution bottleneck move video card hardware unboxed good youtube video processor scaling resolution
generally yes gor game listed maybe rival wont get 240 good
yes
used 4080s issue
yeah super solid combo got spec
yes run 7600x 7800xt run 1440 wonderfully
perfectly fine semibudget upgradable build 38 wide 7500f 4070ti super complaint far
probably even enough 5070ti
get 7600x3d would even better
frame rate average 1520fps lower 9800x3d 1 low much lower however enough decide
bro im rocking ryzen 5 7600x 4070 ti super 4k gaming run perfectly youre good dont even worry pretentious idiot
yes
youd fine personally id recommend cpu
literally got torched sub suggesting much cheaper 14700k alternative x3d cpu budget actually matter people
wouldnt go 4070ti super4080 max tbh
rtx 4090 better better cpu 2000 usd gpu extra 200 cpushould issue really depends resolution monitor setting ryzen 7600 solid cpu satisfy
yes
yep r5 5600 also bottleneck 3090 suprim 1440p
probably suggested 14th gen intel cpu intel enjoying much popularity day recent bug would physically damage 13th 14th gen chip even though supposed patched patch fix already damaged chip
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvrtf9vfg1j0
said adequate best squeeze maybe 5 better fps game x3d cpu paired 4090 big budget course go x3d cpu
yes
one appears found degradation issue new 13th 14th gen cpu long bios date
sometimes get much 5 especially low resolution yeah mainstream gpus almost never cpu limited
doesnt help people already damaged chip sol
he recommending buy damaged chip tho
think he saying intel said sorry bad crappy design lack qc bricked lot people computer dont worry fixed expensive cpu andor motherboard got damaged screw sound like problem want new cpu replace damaged one hahaha give u money
extended warranty period 2 year rmaing chip
except dreadfully short replacement claiming rmaed chip fake even proven authentic
could run 7600x 4070 super 550w psu 700w would enough
4070 super draw around 220 watt 7600x around 130 700 watt supply plenty
sincerely appreciate helpful comment add context gpu journey started i7 6700u gtx 1030 everything great tried playing forza horizon 5 high setting got rtx 3050 2022 thats pandemic gpu could get without sacrificing vital organ dont buy thing itsits good got 3060 ti paired 7600x life great indiana jones game cuckolded
thanks giving amazon anymore money
thank
something like gtx 970 play cyberpunk 720p around 60fps probably im confused i711700 720p monitor though
maybe grab rx6600 call day really 720p something older like gtx1660 rx580 8gb work know much longer driver support
would personally buy used 10 series card like 1070 1080 currently 11600k 1080ti run cyberpunk high setting 1080p smoothly able play new game really well
720p sure man
kind monitor using
used gtx 10 series card get higher end one depending budget gtx 1080 playing new game ultrawide 25k low setting 60fps easy
oh god
get used 1650 super 1060 like 50 get lowmedium setting 1080p older title whole lot new one simply 4gb vram still play popular game fsr title help looking spot 1070 1080 1660 superti give good like 2050 boost 1650 super without much moreive even seen 5600xts go 100 considerable improvement 1650 super
anything rx570 8gb
play console point least youll get 60fps 1080p
saw 1070 sold around 70 ebay
likely cpu limited 720p xd get rx 6600 rtx 3060 b580 could table driver overhead fix low resolution may far worse two card dont forget enable resizeable bar especially b580 also rx6600 update bios motherboard latest available get 1080p screen come xd
try rx 5600 non xt rtx 2000 series card still much gtx 1000 1600 series bought used rx 5600 xt 120 still able play bf2042 1080p get 90 fps low
gtx 1080 handle game today 720p 720p stick 1080p get like used rtx 2080ti 3070 4060 ti 16gb
buy 1070 new ebay like 130
rx580
id say rx 6600 find 200 also 5700xt found 130 used ebay performs similarly 6600 xt cheaper cant hardware rt thats probably big concern price point
card sub 150w region psu bit limiting 1070 run cyberpunk fine 1080p regularly go sub 100 used 1060 6gb 3gb variant thats enough vram go 70 also 1660 superti 2060 fall performance bracket see cheapest nvidia 9xx series would skip enough vram amd older stuff powerhungry rx 580 8gb could fine pull around 180w vega 56 cheap need 650w psu newer amd card would recommend rx 6600xt thats mote 150 used performs realm 2070 older card get driver support anymore really want stopgap bigger upgrade get 1060 longer solution go 2060 better 6600xt
1080ti rog strix oc sale youre interested usa pm
used 1080 ti
1660 ti would probably job xd
50904090 best 720p card jk 1650 1660 super good pick dont eat much power expensive well country least 1060 cheaper well country kinda price 16xx sometimes harder find amd cant go wrong rx6600 higher card though eat power remember new intel gpus also good pick snag one isnt scalped
720 cant imagine good
gtx 470
try getting 6650xt play 1080p ultra sold mine around 180
gtx 1080 u good bang buck rx 580 8gb 1060 6gb used 1080 100 rx 580 80 get gtx 1060 6gb less 60 sometimes wouldnt look 1070s much run 1060 1080 like less good rx 580 price edit fix rx 580 rx 580 8gb clarity
least gtx 1660 tisuper
got 1070 ti cheap run harmony 10600k
thanks asking question vewlix arcade machine 720p monitor want able play fighting game smooth 60 fps good see someone still using resolution
6600 3060
720p different resolution sense best always upper limit 5090 whats reasonable literally decade old flagship 100 less ebay rx 580 1070ti come mind
maybe rtx 4090ti could take 720p rt 60fps
internal graphic yeap thats right need graphic card
intel b580
intel b580 system support resizable bar 250 buck youll get top teir gaming experience long good 500w psu youll fine ive got exact system running evga 500
b580
arc b580 think worth absolutely willing stretch budget little
thing change stay
ever find rx 6600 like 120 130 dollar free shipping ill obviously buy 10 series rx580 gpus cheap consider first
damn sound awesome theyd probably easy snipe ebay cheap
driver support 10 series going soon maybe get 2060
shoe box
damn
even 1440p monitor expensive nowadays
best term performance yes op likely referring best value cost per frame still im curious see many fps generated 5090 running cyberpunk 2077 720p
cpu b580 overhead
feel like b580 still overkill dont see needing 12gb vram 720p would definitely good future proofing anything cheaper fitting
thats around price used rx 5700rx 5700xt non xt version similar performance rx 6600 xt little performance rx 6600
rx 580 nvidia gtx go eol soon newer game need dx12 ultimate support supported rx6000 arc rtx 20 series card newer
youre right u wan na buy new rx580 probably best option youre ok used one 6600 6600xt would hit spot personally buy used many used electronics market go waste
recently upgraded rx580 rx6600 like 70 better average gaming playing aaa game rx580 2024 underwhelming even upscaling effectively made resolution 720p manage play cp2077 acvalhalla newer title would hang hard regardless resolution rx580 like 50 obviously much better value youre good hd resolution dont mind low detail aaa gaming indie game thing fine play time sometimes get itch try aaa game youve putting bought rx6600 140 used sold rx 580 70 didnt get 2x value enough continue 1080p gaming least rest 2025
grab 1080ti something fb marketplace like 120 call day
keep mind newer game start requiring rt card rx 6000 card onward gtx 10 series cant sure important 720p
yea ive seen 1080s going little 80 100 ebay cheap still damn good card
thats stand talking thing ripped handheld console
nothing lower end thats new aside 570 580 youre going used territory point
b570
mean gtx
think posting didnt think something op bothered want 720p
yes ill correct
beep code video card error 100 sure card installed right unfortunately likely crapped know someone pc could test card local computer store even might worth making sure card mobo connection high end gpu
one cpu gaming id rather buy 5700x3d gaming either cpu ddr5 negligible upgrade compared 5700x3d assuming need buy motherboard dont already ddr5
either
probably 8400f long haul replace worthwhile cpu line something would never upgrade 12400f find r57400f r57500f would clear pick
neither 7500f 7600
cant afford 5700x3d
thats understandable wont total cost new am4 motherboard ddr4 ram 5700x3d cheaper ddr5 build
50 gbp ddr5 build might aswell 16 gig ram job also long would considering upgrading 5700x3d
thats 50gbp around 1550 fps 1080p depending game
6600 hold
1080p cpu bound gpu youll get lot better fps 5700x3d either two
first foremost cant compare pc console like dont perform game arent optimized platform youre trying prove build pc offer ps5 like gaming experience less money fact incorrect
8 gb ram gon na serious bottleneck 2025 system wan na compete need 16gb imo
would outperform ps5 8gb ram would severely bottleneck pretty much game rn youd need go 6700 outperform ps5 would say much worth personally cheaper game monthly subscription freedom pc
lol least like 8gb 2133 mhz absolute performance killer single channel ram absurdly painfully slow there caveat 128gbs space f tier bomb psu hope getting close matching ps5 going used used cpu still ryzen 5 3600 used gpu rx 57005700xt actual normal 2x8gb ram kit least 512 gb storage psu isnt fire hazard
dont think maybe stronger gpu cheaper ps5
dont think pc would outperform ps5 whilst 450 would better versatility
wont cant even play stuff 8 gig ram wont able store two triple title 128 gig storage
nope wont
would probably close gpu isnt enough memory really run window storage pathetic
dont think gaming pc beat ps5 without used component mostly sony sell device loss order profit sale game
answered already known answer answer simply console sold either loss minimal margin make money back game licensing monthly subscription fee want prove point friend create pc actually beat ps5 probably around 750 show math buying game especially using stuff like steam sale paying full year subscription ps5 math start make sense pc obviously including fact pc 100 different thing outside gaming far better console
switch cpu 5600x 5700x3d 2 stick ram yes right current state
definitely
appreciate desire youre console killer build thing long pcmr thing youre simply going able outperform ps5 ps5 price playstation game get lot optimization possible single hardware configuration theyre able lot lot less hardware mention sony willing sell hardware loss nearloss know get paying online service andor software youre strictly shooting performanceforthedollar probably buy playstation youre trying get machine pc youre going need accept youre going able outperform playstation price thats ok pc able lot thing playstation cant
sony sell ps5 cheap actually make money selling subscriptionsgames hope going used good deal
mean go amd gpu run bazzite may able compete id ram another 8 gig least might able net used 6700xt somewhere 160220 thatll get within ps5 range graphic power
nope aint proving anything lol
yup barely enough window program nowadays
yeah redid build cant repost bit
look fine
thats completely normal want fully use gpu
friend told keep running part get worn scared rn even keeping game assassin creed odyssey graphic medium still reacher 100 percent temp around 80 86 c never went beyond 86c even kept game high setting lag fps drop really fine 100 percent even medium setting
mate didnt reach 100 would wasting gpu whole purpose utilise 100 capability friend doesnt know he talking also laptop temp expected much higher general laptop never live long desktop anyway thats fundamental statistic like screwing running gpu 100 whole purpose
reach 100 percent even medium setting isnt struggling
concept struggling computer chip understand
overspending mobo b650 totally fine want one wifi still way cheaper proposing additionally might want look 7800x3d instead 9700x price range thats fine case would drop 7700x 7600x mainly gaming gaming performance difference 3 chip basically negligible core help productivity task question might able use would rough minimum gpu listed game 1060 1660ti isnt whole lot better would totally work streaming time probably wont look great even encoding cpu streaming stream likely wouldnt look great considering would playing low setting already also reason specifically want asus 4070 generally speaking little difference aib model also make sure buying 6000mhz ram
thank reply really appreciate especially mobo going look cheaper b650 model seems like ton thing stock 7800x3d however considering 7700x first 9700x around 20 im actually extreme gamer dont really run buy newest demanding title consistent one play lot multiplayer competitive game like marvel rival league legend valorant apex legend warzone etc goal able stream game like performance quality drop unfortunately 4070 super went stock look month back 4070 available im wondering would still get job done im looking
country support country try pcpartpickercom search part collate result retailer website country tell gpu side take look tom hardware gpu ranking chart check cheapest performance range want country httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html
arent satisfied want better cpu 5700x3d go 7800x3d 9800x3d budget isnt high enough get one cpu let alone new mobo ddr5 ram need go
youre dude 5800x3d budget would pointless dont need upgrade would go am5 new cpu new ram new mobo
think need specify youre satisfied research see whats holding back id expect 4070 bottleneck often 5700x3d generally combo give great experience cooling keeping update driver memory speedtimings set using fast monitor plugged gpu
get actual upgrade need r77800x3d r79800x3d plus new motherboard ddr5 memory kit quite literally end line am4
mainly wanted upgrade eft even tho game shit term optimization wouldve guessed would get atleast 7080 fps amd much worse intel tarkov need point seem made clown post lmao another problem ram moment 32 gb use 2x 8gb stick 3200 mhz 2x 8gb stick 2133 mhz get new one next month suppose holding back alot
cant use stick different speed run frequency lowest tolerate yeah taht make difference
ram 100 issue help lot upgrade ram still dont get good performance use something like cpuz msi afterburner check cpu gpu temp possible cooling insufficient computer thermally throttling also lose performance
get 2x16gb 3600mhz cl16 ram kit around 55
ryzen x3d particularly sensitive memory timing tarkov sensitive memory speedcapacity get another kit exact model 3200mhz kit youre running theyd probably work may safer buy new kit like ubadtlc4 said 2x16gb 3600mt cl16 would ideal inexpensive said wouldnt expect tarkov run esport smooth hardware
alright price awesome anymore though option 4060ti basically performance nvidia feature 380 3060ti 10 worse one 320 model see b580 10 worse available around 250280 right low supply way high price rn 7700xt 15 performance 405 right thats
adding 4060 ti insufficient vram today game 3060 ti story getting worse tip would b580 alternative
sorry im europe price different 4060ti like 415
think b580 best option actually find 250ish idea happen otherwise 6750xt 4060ti somewhat tossup yes 4060ti vram problem manifest play 1080p im sure also get access dlss least better fsr believe fsr 4 going supported 6000 series anyway either way tossup personally would get 6750xt couldnt find b580 good price anywhere
stalker 2 1080p max setting pcgameshardware german hardware game review page sorry using english video fastest could find httpsyoutubecomshortsv25f0ncppg4
fair mean drop setting use upscalingframegen listen im nvidia defender people act like option suffer stuttering hit vram cap isnt case think also insane stalker 2 optimized poorly hit 8gb vram constraint 1080p wasnt long ago needed run game 4k least 1440p max setting hit limitation defending nvidia bastard vram either though
ye use upscalers doubt said would get better worse
go am5
looking am5 processor read lga 1700 last generation 14 wont able upgrade suggest am5 suggest ryzen 5 9600 ryzen 7 9600x overclock
true yes run benchmarking current setup rtx3090 1600p resolution get around 100 gpu utilization 4045 cpu normal gpu sole component responsible rendering game upgrade 5090 card could i910900k keep would cpu upgrade pretty much mandatory entirely depends exact situation notice performance varies per game constantly changing heavily effected exact game setting evident relationship isnt static universal one cant answer question yes response logical route would simply use new gpu existing hardware assess noticeable issue begin although youre buying 2000 gpu im guessing difficult simply upgrade cpu motherboard anyways point
9800x3d recommended best gaming cpu true yes wide margin closest competitor 7800x3d even anything intel put last 2 generation intel pretty pathetic get around 100 gpu utilization 4045 cpu kind benchmarking running looking per core performance keep mind game gotten better using multiple core case game still running task 12 core cpu single core performance tends matter significantly overall cpu utilization really matter productivity task 10900k would definitely bottleneck 5090 im sure much honestly afaik chip doesnt bottleneck 5090 am5 x3d chip keep mind 5090 probably going close impossible buy anywhere near msrp month well
sound like faulty power supply

ive started see lot 7700 suggested 9000 series lack improvement cooler im 100 set assuming could reuse corsair h110i aio currently sure still amd bracket im good 250 ssd mainly use o 12 game play regularly would need readwrite speed storage use everything else ive reading new build probably better route go upgrading gpu since i77700 bit dated
reason going 7700 opposed getting either 7700x 9700x
yep upgrading i7 7700 without change isnt feasible still think 250gb ssd enough also something always upgrade later however strongly recommended clean window install change pc much
1 bundle price 2 9700x slightly faster 7700 gaming thats price difference without bundle price included like 50bucks 3 7700x 105w cpu 2 65w cpu 7700x easier cool efficient 34 performance 50 wattage isnt worth point 2 3 matter 7700 100 buck cheaper x version 130bucks cheaper 9700x nobrainer
oh course thats half reason main ssd primarily used window less worry ifwhen need move new build yeah eventually 250 upgraded serf purpose game start playing daily readwrite intensive take 100gb thanks
get 1tb storage use extra money upgrade 6600 used 6600xt150200 6700 xt 200250 go intel b580 new 250270

thank youve huge help
youre best thank much insight really enjoying learning especially someone know software well nice see whats making machine thinking ive looking b570 4060 argument internet gpu community really doesnt lack information ability actually answer question one thing wondering amd 5600 7500 different compatibility thing
7500f 1520 faster single core performance yes cant fit am4 cpu am5 motherboard doesnt work like
question aesthetic want fan match fan already willing pay premium
matching fan always look good although prefer arctic cant go wrong tbh
relatively price dont know two choice quietest
would say arctic quieter perform better corsair fan
marginal count youre setting fan curve properly itll make absolutely difference tbh
get mobo io feature suitable specific need 160 b650 mobo feature need itll fine
vote asrock
thanks dont need much im simple guy
httpsdepcpartpickercomlistx7czkf better cpu efficient better price performance cooler am5 motherboard faster ram good ssd sn850x great cost bit though better 4070ti super gigabyte model chosehas terrible cooler cost worth great case different psu overall price p dont open reddit app every depcp link app always us amazon price
hey cool build thanks however really want keep intel cpu use apps optimized intel amd
know 13th 14th gen issue right furthermore apps use favor intel
im 100 sure ive told college stick intel use tensorflow pytorch dabble unity love play indie game seems like application amd competitive slightly behind didnt know issue thanks pointing look like seems control already extended warranty seems really nice well
would still recommend 9900x i7 14700k choice
seller 0 review
yes
seller new recently made barely sold anything likely scam especially username sound chinese probably safer looking local deal
youre brand new pc building avoid buying used hardware run problem youre going harder time troubleshooting versus experienced builder buy new rtx 4080 super 5080 available day save hassle money
happen bay area let know lot folk selling locally sv
5090 around corner brotha
chinahong kong
right lol wouldnt even buy 100 dollar worth anything zero review account
5090 great card like half price reasonable guarantee real listing 4090 card good condition id jumping heartbeat
sell local used computer part store poor kid need part
depending mb bump cpu 5700x3d add another 16gb ram got nice computer
put linux build good pc web light gaming doesnt require gpu much faster enough sell
selling store would probably guarantee get 50 less money doesnt
yeah dont need worth buying cpu resell
honestly pc worth little second hand selling store save wasting time talking customer ending selling little anyway
look sell marketplace working hourly extra money get truuuust
gon na losing money sell old part depreciate value
oh right youre going use need upgrade
yeah fully aware pretty much value
ah figured wondering would easier sell something bit better ryzen 5 1600
didnt mean something meant wouldnt want deal customer would accumulate small amount money know even old stuff show work etc worth
oh sure dont worry didnt take offence understood meant guess try reach pc store see deal totally get mean like dont get people seel clothes like 5 fell happy time probablly took get take photo ship ecc way earned want get rid sothat doesnt occupy space home gpu still worth upgrading gpu least year wondering could possible solution
want upgrade couple month whats budget
germany want new build ready till marchapril edit budget around 13001800 depending whats enough last another 56 year

cpu really enough dont know much cpu
x3d cpu sweet yes enough also upgrade 1440p put workload gpu work cpu comparatively pair weaker cpu stronger gpu might want 1080p
7600x3d one best gaming cpu best 9800x3d second 7800x3d third 7600x3d really efficient 65w tdp enough 7500f 65w cpu doesnt extra cache extra cache make difference lot game definitely game like valorant cs2 like cache 7600x3d give definitely performance game like forza horizon doesnt really care wont see big difference end cpu give great experience still upgrade 7500f later something like 9800x3d

technically 5800x3d likely better gaming two choice id probably go 7700x actually 7600x probably make sense similar 7700x gaming edit ucanismajoris85s point completely accurate cant believe forgot include
already am4 5700x3d since 5800x3d make sense 300 least u probably similar elsewhere even 5700x3d price terrible unless maybe aliexpress ebay used 180200 sale new build 76007600x7700x depending price deal edit problem question dont know country dont know price 5700x3d price seem change daily even u day like 230 307 could back 200 tomorrow deal country clue price itd sheer stupidity consider 5800x3d especially 5700x3d 300 u especially new build
am4 already
even 7600 7500f arent far away get 99 performance 7600x small oc

yes
5700x3d way go
go looking like ebay aliexpress replacement fan specific gpu
im afraid might individual fan issue since 3 stopped working time
could deshroud gpu ziptie 92mm 120mm fan heatsink connect mobo header use like fancontrol want control via gpu temp
great build nothing need change

nvidia recommends 850w close max load considered buffer would like hit around 5070 peak load effiency terrible heating problem old build doubt 5000 series run cooler 3070 want reduce heating psu much possible
google say 850 1000 watt power supply recommend 4090 draw 850 watt isnt better get powerful unit dont get close full load since psus effiecient around like 3070 maybe also 80 load lot temperature issue current build

yep work really worth though eh
per dell site yes
generation work long psu supply enough power usually main risk shitty proprietary build dell particular infamous making computer hard upgrade ask gpuram reasoning upgrading 10700k around 250 right might better saving building replacement pc depending current hardware usage
whats previous pc part pc still work proposing spending lot money whats realistically relatively minor upgrade overall trying get info
hi pc used right one rx 580 still work fine cap 60fps game like league valorant pc loud overall fine
component listed reused current pc actually trying upgrade 6600 bit less double performance 580 1080p depending game could also look newer intel b570 b580 card much better around price honestly sure white model either cooler really want aio aesthetic get thermalright 120ml 240ml aio plenty different white model choose probably better cheaper vetroo one chose biggest issue game named also likely cpu gpu 580 definitely old neither game graphic intensive think upgrading cpu 5600 might meaningful upgrade start even want gpu first thats totally fine expect wont see huge performance gain 1800x
want use component current pc like psu ram im sure salvage havent even taken apart pc yet listed new one post case compatible also dont want look intel card since want white gpu like said would hard find white model appreciate suggestion thank thermalright white aio suggestion found cost less vetroo aio thank insight gpu v cpu situation well think might go suggestion upgraded gpu 6600 cpu 5600x think would work well together thank insight reply
yeah 5600x 6600 great budget pairing could also upgrade gpu future want better performance 5600x good pair anything like 6800 xt level performance gpu
thank helped lot
take budget divide 3 equal part 1 part spend gpu 1 part spend cpu motherboard ram 1 part spend everything else case psu storage etc right massively overspending cpu spent half much cpu twice much gpu youd still overspending cpu

video output fine
well fine low setting 30fps average 1 low single digit try otherwise dont bother
pretty much get whatever monitor want considering computer already multiple bottleneck yes still bottleneck new monitor
got ta play lowest low setting like 30 fps u get one
1440p 4k bottleneck setup gamer try make sure get back home work fine long dont expect hogh refresh rate alongside 4k60 doable though
talking gaming 30fps dont game want regular task medium consumption able use higher refreshrates
mean multiple bottleneck
dont game want coding medium consumption
1440p 180hz wont work 1050ti
well assuming also dont need gpu work fine card least theoretically capable outputting 8k refresh rate non gaming task would dependent port like example dp 12 go 144hz 1440p course monitor
every computer ever built multiple bottleneck dont see reason wouldnt
fine case
id recommend getting 5700x3d available much cheaper 5800x3d performance get close 5700x great wouldnt recommend 5800x 5700x basically undervolted cheaper 5800x near performance 7800 xt good gpu however struggle 4k honestly want game 4k youll need look 7900 xtx4080 higher imo least dont want upgrade gpu near future id personally recommend sticking 1440p eventually oled monitor resolution soon look 3440x1440 ultrawide oled something much easier run gpu 4k

thanks
new build
yea tink software issue
nois started happend week
tried hdmi cable instead
got ask nvme m2 worth price today considering cost sata ssd day yes however also know increased sequential speed throughput relevant many common workload like gaming casual use booting o wont make noticeable difference also filling ssd lead slow down
m2 socket nvme sata m2 drive nvme m2 drive multiple time faster sata ssds o absolutely nvme m2 drive doesnt mean need 2tb one large file game whatever second ssd even repurposing existing one
theyve worth proce couple year already theyre great
isnt buying nvme m2 boot drive day price difference sata small performance compared many component people throw money tiny gain
regular ssd fine time youre going notice difference youre getting tired load time game file general application normal sata ssd fine
went m2 mobo supported 2x go sale often like said price sometimes cheaper sata drive
yea thats im asking real life experience number doesnt tell story truth told even name ssd got slow down huge like certain high load operation struggle generally speaking fine
advantage using 2 different ssds instead one
got m2 avoid cable sata drive tbh
thanks insight seems booth option legit depends better deal cause even regular ssds load time arent bad either came time hdd norme haha cable management cant downside tho m2 look indeed way cleaner
interesting double checked ssd still cheaper amazon exemple crucial m2 2to t500 200ish x9 crucial 170 say difference actually huge used market another story ssds bargain reason
make m2 sata drive btw m2 connector used drive commonly used wifi well example httpswwwneweggcomcrucialmx500500gbpn82e16820156177
bought 2tb xpg gammix s70 129 cad 2tb samsung 980 pro 149 cad amazon sale sure could probably get cheaper usd wait right sale
used computer shop dont buy used ssd part always need new
well thats steal u right case seems wise wait bit till good deal insight regret right didnt pull trigger 970 2to samsung marketplace 120 x
whats risk exactly
yeah probably got around black friday cyber monday something also think wanted return xpg one reason great btw think mixed review something amazon said wouldnt accept return refunded anyways think page said returnable werent something got free
dont know use like use far likely kill storage part computer important thing keep intact
seller reputable yes ebays buyer protection allow return get money back doesnt work even seller say dont allow return
also price good true likely
experience ebay safe even get scammed around 30 day report get money back bought used pc part didnt even look seller
ive bought 1660 super 2080 super ebay 3 2 year ago worked absolutely fine like others mentioned check selling history review etc 2080 super came someone sold 1 item confident enough price bit lower general market value ebay good protecting buyer
sold old gpus ebay bought youd get original box cleaned original component still 1000 hour gaming like 5000 hour general use time there
apparently popular seller even though say minimal sign wear something like shouldnt concerned performance issue
yeah gpus always run full performance hit max temp slow near max temp every 3070 within percent depending cooling worst case scenario redo thermal paste rarely necessary give degree
checked correct audio output used window sound setting andor realteks control panelwhatever software called
pc wont even recognize headphone audio output plug front panel
pcpartpickercom check compatibility am4 cpu ddr4 ram am5 motherboard thats physically compatible ram twice expensive id expect ddr4 changing am4 mobo little cheaper
ive looking individual part whole ill check pcpartpicker thank
replaced mobo something like b550 gaming gen 3 would good build ddr4 am4 compatible ram looked could get something like corsair vengeance lpx ddr4 ram 32go 60 amazon
moddiy aliexpress
didnt even think look aliexpress ill check well thanks
nice psu cybenetics testing want number

hitachi sold hd division wd like decade ago already
good best
wd sg reasonable hitachi crap
get ssd trust way better
thats thought surprised see show amazon none microcenter
hgst travelstar zk500 old laptop still work fine error bad sector 10 year old hitachi made best hard drive
getting 10tb ssd reasonable price still keep hdds system theyre 8tb higher keep medium file plex finished video editing project storage absolutely nothing wrong hdds consider pricepertb would use one o drive gaming though dear god
probably one first two imo ive avoiding review 9800x3d since im used 300 plenty great gaming cpu
honestly dont play competitive game getting 7600x allocating budget stronger gpu make sense software development may need core honestly im sure core count would appropriate
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen57600nonx20htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen57600nonx20html 120 id upgrade could probably sell 5600x 6080 also benchmark 3080 slightly slower 3090 5700x3d last next 45 year fine without think go am6 really matter 1440p
120 worth
depends youre gpu bottlenecked play 4k mostly single player game play high setting mostly gpu likely already 100 usage gamingwhich mean getting new cpu wont improve fps game need figure gpu hitting 100 usage playing determine worth upgrade constantly near 100 usage playing dont bother worth upgrade
definitely worth game benefit extra cache game greatly benefit extra cache much better 1 low making experience much smoother
feel like extra 2 core 4 thread help game like battlefield 2042 well cpu 90 usage time game lol
yeah youre right resell 5600x
yeah think
time ive seen gpu hitting 99 think use dlss performance 4k really demanding

corsair hx1000i fully modular platinum psu 2023 come new 12vhpwr cable cable doesnt require adapter rated 600w highly recommend
honestly wasnt going bother hassle worth
couldnt handle loot gifemotefreeemotespackjoy take away make sure check connecter every often especially high power cable might catch something early prevent damage
post rnvidia nvidia issue trying pull 600w load psu port designed
long useing sort load ie scenario using way 2 year 100 gpu load probably 4 hour day average new psu bought 2 12vhpwr plug psu hopefully issue im ready next gen card want
lol posted discussion issue shared help people learn happened posted happened using nvidia card card notorious melting power cable nvidia adapter melted 4 plug psu im expert particular psu provides 2 82x8 cable light reading rating plug standard draw supply psu side capable suplying 300watts per plug market cable psu manufacturer correct guage handle draw people assume fine use
think problem cabling honest guy say trying pull 600w load psu port designed ive running system like well year zero issue think user error nvidia thing havent seen burning connector month dont think 4090 issue
im sure either getting trying pull 600w load psu port designed 2 port rated supply 300w 4 150w 8pins mention 4090 600w draw 450 4 8 pin plug fused 41 adapter glue melted mean 1125w per plug got hot enough fail even max theoretical load cable config 150w per plug done user error bad cable degraded time also clarify never said 4090 issue 4090 used 12vhpwr issue anything else
fair enough guess wouldnt like use fused cable adapter good idea transient spike melting 12vhpwr port like said corsair psu excellent come 12vhpwr cable directly connects two port psu people reported issue hope get new psu fix issue
im trying rude dont think read first reply original post properly anyway reiterate already purchased new psu win p130ii 1300w psu 2 12vhpwr plug psu finger crossed pan well issue
cpu already ancient couple year ago need new mobo ddr4 ddr5 ram want decent cpu upgrade
could probably use ram either double u get 16 32gb kit ddr3 u want upgrade pc imo probabky shouldnt cost 40
bare minimum cpu would 7400f 7500f assuming budget based post seems like best bet
look 7500f would miss v 5700x3d apart obvious am4am5 budget whatever need really dont want spend ton want something thatll last year least give decent gaming experience 3070ti
7500f last long time strong cpu am5 7500f basically 12 slower 76007600x without igpu alot cheaper probably one best price performance cpu personally lowest id go 7600x like insurance igpu id rather get cheap quality air cooler cpu benchmark hierarchy 2024 cpu ranking tom hardwarehttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewscpuhierarchy4312html
want save 7900xt enough 1440p get 850 psu next httpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist use list reference
none look like great value 7900xt would bump u 2 tier plenty fir 60fps could check 6950xt price maybe wait month u imo
also futureproofing good choice go amd nearly every new game badly optimized made dlss mind
thanks list went 7900xtx sale ill try get good psu
unfortunately price pc part poland stupidly high 6950xt 600usd
nice id probably get 1000w psu xtx owner one hear people voice instability issue card turned lot case swapping 850w lower psu 1000w fixed
high bw 7800xt 7900xt speed guess latter may worth u rly prefer new
thanks help managed get 7900xtx 930usd hope enough year need get new psu
might ram training
consider ive got 32gb waited around 5 minute one time occurred try rule could really take longer regardless ive mostly dismissed cold boot new ram config boot reasonable time u think worth leaving longer period time

hard say depends game play resolution fps targeting also game quite cpu intensive something like hogwarts legacy example however safe say losing performance gpu using 5600x likely 6950xt already get bigger performance boost upgrading gpu upgrading cpu sticking 6950xt afford upgrade best gpu first bit later
depends game resolution
shouldnt hold back game gpu intensive say shouldnt able discern bottleneck unless fps counter still able run game upper 90 5080 potential
itll look pretty similar mix cpu scaling chart 4080 super 4090 suspect

play 4k single player play multiplayer use 1440 amd rig
substantial worth 7900xtx throttled 5900x idea significant got 9800x3d really never got see card could perform depend play youll likely see improvement workload mostly gpu insignificant compared getting new cpu would recommend getting am5 board x3d gpu new gpu split difference get lesser gpu 5000 series am5 x3d
cpu matter little game high resolution lower resolution matter look example httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d20html
budget allows 5080 youre better 5070ti cheap upgrade am5 7500f something like am4 upgrade x3d worth anymore ship pretty much sailed sell am4 platform money saved getting 5070ti buy b650 32gb 6000cl30 7500f much better experience 5600x 5080 question youll losing half performance 5600x holding back friend 7800xt around 20 compared 7900 5080 around 60 faster youll running half capacity pretty much worse depending game 1440p btw lol
id get 5700x3d gpu staying am4 even likely bottleneck somewhat
1440p mostly fine youre going lose cpu intensive title might hot take think 5600x enough am6 nova lake would upgrade am5 youre getting something like 7800x3d better
5600x holding rtx 3090 back 1080p got 9800x3d performance difference night day advice u afford go am5 platform
last time used 5600x barely capable fully utilizing 6750xt 1440p going great unless youre running 4k
truth
3080 3080ti 4080 kind crazy path
cpu dependant game obviously benefit cpu upgrade per bunch benchmark many done 1440p difference 5800x3d 9800x3d max graphic almost irrelevant talking within 1015fps usually less even 4k 5600x lose performance sure 5800x3d fine high re thats went already am4 board upgrading am5 little gain
monitor u
113fps v 164fpshttpsyoutubery9vjwigrbgt247 big difference 5800x3d delivers quite bit fps said also every single game test delivers 110 fps 5800x3d except starfield delivering 100 might enough locked 120 fps saying 5800x3d enough want locked 60fps game 2025 stretching truth way much 5800x3d much better
zen3 series significant improvement zen2 term ipc 5600x noticeably better gaming 3700x going x3d would improvement game pretty modest cost particularly 1 low frame time consistency
pair better cpu two worse gpu two pair 7800x3d 4080
pairing literal bottom 7000 series cpu 5080 punishable law nhf
3080 since 2020 wanted upgrade vram found 3080ti used sold 3080 10gb used cost 50 sure anyone wouldnt take upgrade 50 found msi ventus 3x oc edition 4080 brand new 750 clearance section pc shop sold 3080ti used made 15 profit card
first youre saying isnt true second people arent running native 1440p 4k theyre running upscaled 1080p 1440p 4k case cpu make huge difference even 4k native 9800x3d 1 low going 50 higher 5800x3d even put average fps 5600x dont even think maintain 60 fps space marine 2 low graphic 1080p situation right every game launched aaa since 2022 really hard cpu exception ditched 5600x last year reason want play new game 120fps cant 5600x anymore thats reality care 60 fps 90 time youll probably okay 5600x much longer

main connected via 1x dp monitor 1x hdmi leaf 2x dp neither port work 3rd monitor detected window display setting confirm port actually working sound like software issue start clean reinstall driver using ddu
clean reinstall ddu seems fixed issue thanks though might worth noting im using older driver since already downloaded used ddu preparation installing 4080s first place

thought also saw multiple people saying 5070 ti best value card 50 series 7800x3d much better 5070 ti worth 5080 base ur opinion purely aesthetic
purely aesthetic coming someone white build value standpoint generally xx70 card give best price performance

like much difference 12 v 24gb 12gb 24gb refer vram capacity capacity matter dont enough game 12gb fine 1440p gaming 3090 really us much electricity 3080ti read basically power consumption situation would buy theyre basically card mate difference 20 dollar go 3090
gaming pc qhd monitor dont think really concerned electricity bill get powerful card
definitely 3090 would consider upgrade psu well
16gb could nice could fine powerspikes may shoot 750w either 4070s viable option
yeah electricity major concern dont really loud card power use away higher little fps believe worth thing 1440p monitor incredible power efficient didnt buy plus
4070s country 750 dollar away budget psu atx 30 theoretically could handle power excursion well recommended psu 3090 750w believe psu enough
may fine many 3080s often spike 100 watt new 4070 nons could worth considering right price many psus handle spike well rated wattage
yeah
yeah enough
r7 7700x excellent cpu application often enthusiast sell fast cpu simply need budget ca directed gpu play game 1440p 4k 7700x hold back even play 1080p capable may push 7900 absolute limit

sadly yes
many people similar situation asked reality there gon na bottleneck somewhere within system really depends gamesoftware asking question open ended question doesnt really mean anything people failed ask whether wallet bottleneck right question ask here current setup want achieve ie cyberpunk 75 fps 1080p budget 500 upgrade get

stock going tomorrow
gotcha still dont know look motherboard haha plz help
dont know dont ask interest stock
go pcpartpickercom pick one isnt absolute cheapest
three beep mean something different based motherboard manufacturer one still usually likely point ram issue test ram thoroughly memtest86 free create bootable usb drive boot pc usb drive run full memory test preferably 4 pass per stick check ram error multiple ram stick also try booting pc one ram stick installed try stick individually different ram slot help isolate specific ram stick causing issue particular ram slot motherboard faulty doesnt hurt update bios case nothing wrong ram
motherboard gigabyte b350 gaming v3 bought new ram test didnt show error
huh thats weird since 3 beep typically indicate baseexpanded memory failure motherboard likely compatibility issue knowing full spec computer would help lot none following work older b350 motherboards often require bios update support newer ram kit even memtest pass check gigabyte support page model confirm ram qvl qualified vendor list also update bios latest version using qflash available could also disconnect nonessential usb device faulty peripheral eg hub drive cause usb controller reset freezing system also havent done already inspect motherboard psu physical damage case
pc spec rx 570 ryzen 7 1700 ram 2x8gb 3200mhz teamgroup gigabyte b350 gaming v3 deepcool power supply 550w 80 bronze ill try ram test ill check whether supported motherboard much appreciated
psu theoretically sufficient rx 570 ryzen 7 1700 ryzen 7 1700 zen 1 weaker memory controller compared newer cpu even bios update achieving 3200mhz b350 board might possible usually instability already 29333000mhz solution dont work maunually lower ram speed 2933mhz bios test stability disable xmp crash persist
device started working normally disabled xmp went bios set speed 2933 stable im still shocked fact processor doesnt support 3200 thank much help wouldnt able reach solution without disabled xmp set manually 2933 one profile available 3200 issue
great im glad could help xmp profile aggressive cpu memory controller harm done turning setting manually common fix thats often used eventually upgrade ryzen 30005000 cpu bios update youll likely achieve 3200mhz speed easily
gaming opinion x870e seems unnecessary would double check motherboard requriements memory seems expensive never provided speed 6000cl30 would ideal probably dont need 64gb shouldnt overpay dominator memory 990pro waste money gaming dont benefit spec 850w psu would fine cpu cooled 40 air cooler youre spending extra strictly aesthetic cooler
thank input im going look option
5700x3d noticeable versus 5700x use 1660 super bad way thinking sooner later upgrade gpu regret past wasted money bad cpu either upgrade 5700x3d 56005600x whichever cheaper dont consider 5700 non x 5700x better 5600 gaming
im sure think youll get 200 fps cpu gpu handle probably utilize 99 gpu meaning youll gpu bottlenecked upgrade ryzen cpu also benefit highspeed ram competitive game maybe upgrading 3400mhz kit could give stability frame pacing would prefer 5700x3d im rocking one setup let get am4 platform also check price am5 upgradeit might cost much region id consider well
might save money especially youre willing buy secondhand wait nvidias 5000 series release plus couple week allow actually get people hand might get higher end 4000 series someone upgrading bit cheaper wouldve otherwise long youre willing buy second hand 1440p144fps target im sure youre going able get without something mid upper end 4000 series anyways 4070 4080 12gb get pricey new option skimp eg building pci 30 system mean older cpu ram etc cheaper since youre building completely new system want last next 5 year id probably plan 1500 door used card 1750 new 4070 get m2 nvme ssd least couple tb game hilariously enormous nowadays 5tb motherboard support two separate 2tb drive would better storage almost nonissue nowadays
1440p144hz depends entirely game want play even 4090 achieve certain game full path tracing new gpu cost anything 300 1000 depending gaming goal
country first glance look fine could possibly use tuning save cost part invest better one like gpu 4070 7900xt want 7900xt vram straight faster 40 faster regular 4070 20 faster 4070 super
10 year long time going back far youd using gtx 9xx seriesrx 2xx gpu right tech advancing ai rt reckon uptodate build would compare even less favorably 2035 9xx2xx dont think youre planning realistic good build next year though course
thanks insight im france figured since get 7900xt 650 would need save lot part upgrade 4080 7900xtx think could save
intel socket already date yes year year buying 4090 already 3 day nvidia releasing 5080 5090 need new cpu motherboard ram
cant get better cpu without changing motherboard unfortunately
current build looking advice upgrading
fucking intel
game work considering 11900k edit screen resolution budget upgrade
cant upgrade cpu without changing motherboard
3440 x 1440 budget pretty high atm
pc ryzen 9800x3d would best cpu gaming
literally gaming point
get ryzen 9800x3d best gaming cpu get pair nice motherboard 2x16gb 6000mhz cl30 ram good go year year
gain next nothing wont provide benefit outside number paper youre likely notice increase noise anything overclock fun gain anything meaningful head roverclocking learn overclock
put cpu using flash
""
better 2nd option point going whole new am4 got better upgrade path 2nd option am5
second option better though id look getting 7500f aliexpress spending bit extra 7600 8500g great cpu unless didnt dedicated gpu also memory absolute trash look getting 6000 cl30 around price also would get higher quality psu listed e avoid cultist tier list basically mean potential explode bueno httpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist
think youre right am3 even am4 upgrade maybe need think bit future wont build new one entirely one get outdated
here build keep back pocket slightly budget get bit closer forgoing cooler use stock cooler nonx variant 7600 also gpu good still good id tweak ssd teamgroup 44l httpsitpcpartpickercomlist7jw734
thank insight trusti cpu really cheaped cant really find good deal 7500f im better buying 7600 70 8500g didnt really know difference ram think ill take kingston fury beast 2x16 gb 20 psu one sure nice advice idea look im oriented towards cheapest decent one corsair cx 2023 750 w 80 bronze 15 added 100 budget thinking could downgrade gpu 4060ti difference think id feel diference thank

5080 stuck 16gb obvious marketing move releasing 2024 gb superti model dealbreaker personal opinion go 5070 ti unless find great deal 4070 ti super 4080 4080 super etc
ah okay okay maybe wait 5070ti released see good offer 4070ti super
buy return one
check rmousereview people give better answer probably also better alternative big company arent really one go

ah didnt know thanks ill check
dont see issue id always check pcpartpicker b650 board likely require bios update 9700x isnt good value priority gaming depends regional pricing etc 360 aio isnt necessary want aesthetic thats fair enough
thanks appreciate feedback build gaming 100 im open increasing budget cpu look
9800x3d
best cpu high fps ryzen 9800x3d real depends buying new pc building base already need say info
gpu important make sure cpu doesnt bottleneck gpu youll fine nvm dont use calculator still gpu important
except rare case framerate mostly driven gpu long processor manufactured last 10 year wont bottlenecked 3060ti
best performing one budget preferably one 3d vcache amd one wont burn intel
im running 5800x3d beautiful journey far
9800x3d7800x3d7600x chose 7600x based midrange budget gpu
high end fps competitive game 9800x3d high tier good fps 7800x3d mid tier 5800x3d 7600x budget 5600
im building something already cpu dying slowly need new one
calculation pulled someone as
bottleneck calculation random number generator
dont use op anyone matter
7800x3d absolutely overkill 5800x3d overpriced 7500f better choice 7600x especially gpu
aaaand mentioned currently give advice p
9800x3d bottleneck 15 4090 1080p yeah pure shit
region specified cant say anything price 7800x3d overkill casual game asked high fps good choice want 240hz performance without budget 9800x3d 7500f available many region thats chose 7600x however find would prefer edit op said 13700f lol
yea sorry current cpu intel core i713700f 30mb cashe 16gb ddr5sdram 1000gb ssd 3060ti dont really know good
prove
cpu issue already file rma intel
troll post completely fine cpu pair cpu even rtx 4090 possible upgrade would getting ram 32gb total pc fine go year come

update bios z690 get 14900k
worth going ddr5 ram
thinking ddr5 ram upgrading pc long time
also could get i9 z790 project zero 1411 power phase good i9
whether ddr5 worth depends specific use case look benchmark
check hardware unboxed z790 vrm roundup
sure there much card doesnt fan stop mode id try fan control next httpsgetfancontrolcomhttpsgetfancontrolcom
thanks burning another hour pain msi center uninstalled everything msi installed fan control far everything want thanks
hah thats awesome
yeah enough youre fine youre ever doubt id recommend pc part pickerhttpspcpartpickercom source dump build itll give idea wattage compatability issue etc
yes
upgrade slowly buy 500w gold psu upgrade ups 12v acid battery 12v lifepo4 battery
thanks suggestion current setup damaging psu ups chance anything blowing psu dy wont mind chance damage component
try use whichever prefer cant tell sound better thats actually matter
audigy rx still sale creative website 99 sing dollar 75 usd think still stand test time
volume audigy sound louder raising volume perhaps maintains better quality honestly always listen headphone low volume also audigy software really problematic window 11 remain doubt probably wont use
yeah itll absolutely fine youll better cpu performance compared whatever previous cpu perfectly fine use normal upgrade gpu
thanks much

minecraft r5 8400f enough newer generation decent clock speed youll totally fine especially since youre worried upgrading anytime soon 5700x beast overkill minecraft worth extra cash situation go 8400f enjoy sweet frame rate
minecraft run completely fine 5700x cheaper overall ddr4 said reason go im talking strictly minecraft though thing may benefit am5 would warrant extra cost far minecraft concerned 5700x completely fine
ryzen 5600 wan na go cheap route basically performance 5700x good thing 8400f would better upgrade path term performance massively ahead price 7500f 7600 comparison
think shouldnt go intel 13th 14th gen honestly first update bios latest version asap second still cant say intel self destruction bug solved long time testing wasnt possible till probably never since everyone know update bios want know disaster here list article httpswwwthevergecom24216305intel13th14thgenraptorlakecpucrashnewsupdatespatchesfixesmotherboards id either go newest intel gen workstation workload 285k go amd 7950x 9950x go amd here table ram speed work ryzen 7000 2 stick 6000mts low cl timing expo 4 stick 4800mts low cl timing expo ryzen 9000 2 stick 6400mts low cl timing expo 4 stick 5200mts low cl timing expo mix ram kit intel generally go higher 4 ddr5 ram kit harder run

youre already looking upgrade spend max budget without worrying see reason slow go 5080 lmao course event dont manage get one waiting stock isnt option id suggest 4080 super would work completely fine 1440p
thanks really appreciate feedback original thought waiting seeing get 5080 msrp think performance gain 4070ti super hopefully enough cover 200 difference

stopped sli good year ago last gpus could 3090ti good
purpose dual gpus gaming died year ago longer supported case using one gpu rendering productivity task doesnt sound like youre
dual gpu gaming died almost fast introduced 10 year old psu would support two gpus depending exact gpu would vram capacity never mattered setting two gpu setup old dual 8gb vram gpu setup would easy setup old dual 16gb vram gpu
yes yes possible largely depends youre gon na sli dead wont help gaming workload support multigpu yes even consumer level system though pcie bandwidth halved consumer cpu board dont enough lane support two full x16 interface yes psus enough wattage dual gpus even something like dual 5090s
real use multi gpu gaming context offload dlssfsr doesnt take equivalent powerful gpu last time heard amd version using igp apu
diedwere killed reason 1 game support still ton tearing experience overall wasnt good case 2 card run based slowest group impossible make scale linearly youre paying 2x 2x performance mention restricted airflow would slow card even 3 youd get got multiple fastest card otherwise itd cheaper get faster card wanted upgrade getting new gen card would faster 4 barely anyone used devs didnt support barely game would use required lot dev work 2 people use 5 nvidia amd killed realized impractical gaming used non gaming task realtime result arent important 6 imagine heat output required psus youd need run multiple 4090s 1x 4090 already us much electric heater low setting doubling would make electric heater id also worry reaching max wattage u circuit given youd running bright 4k 144hz monitor high end cpu ton fan accessory circuit may even need window ac unit separate circuit keep room cool pc us 400w gaming heat room lot already
nah im interested concept dont ever plan getting dual setup lol dual setup used pretty popular back curious died
id expect otherwise psu really bad rx 550 expected power usage 50w
ok
would honestly go part relatively low power cheap even something happens anything real value lost
totally fine like psu cutting tech random chinese factory cant perfectly handle advice leave plenty headroom using cheap psu spec may inflated look fine
psu important part pc think investment safety long life component get psu reputable manufacturer unit least average quality dont use generic low quality psus
nah psu important part pc dont waste money expensive psu cheaply built pc build undoubtedly
agree would much rather middle line 600w 700w low b c tier psu high end higher b tier psu meant could get performance better part
average quality psu system expensive never situation using generic garbage good idea could literally kill anyall component pc worse cause fire might get lucky shortens life component gamble
also choke die drinking water perhaps youd steer clear
ive helped rebuild pc garbage psus fail nearly always take part also many review generic psus tested often dont meet rated spec inadequate fail safety feature testing often high ripple reduces life connected component review also show catastrophic failure causing fire hazard model known average adequate quality reasonable price reason gamble generic garbage
dont make habit recommending people drink brown water might kill doesnt make good idea

sorry forgot mention mainly game development unreal engine 5 gaming
thanks cpu isnt much better current cpu
step 7950x 9900x
know talking ryzen 7 7700 35 faster single core performance get assumption would like hear difference 7900x 7700 tdp core count edited afterward use case would assume 4 year older cpu would perform slightly worse
dont really understand cause 100 buck price difference perform way better
really thats asking guy chose cpu based superficial spec like frequency number core cache memory
well 7950x 16core part better brute forcing performance bad gaming either 9900x newer architecture version 7900x improvement 7900x make better pretty much everything 7900x isnt bad choice wondered needed performance
edited comment use case benefit core gaming wont know nothing game development cpu utilization regard
oh thanks look
im clueless tried uninstalling driver best luck curious answer
clarify youve connected antenna wifi card correct
think broken sys file usually id say run dism however without good copy sys file internet wont work think sys file network stack broken
probably unpopular wifi shit overall plug normal ethernet cable let install driver connect internet may use wifi see work issue might youre window 11 beta tester try operating system see internet work dont understand anything window even try window 7 10 see work
forgot write list tried uninstalling wifi ethernet device reinstalling driver redownladed gigabyte website case last driver downloaded corrupt nothing changed
yes also unscrewed antenna make sure didnt bend center pin antenna side connector upon assembly
already tried connecting via ethernet ierj45 also wouldnt recognized
roll back ethernet driver window default driver device manager see connect way
window 11 stop beta testing imo like 2 year
option roll back driver grayed device manager im assuming computer never connected internet thus didnt chance get default driver
sorry replied comment without expanding collapsed section installed latest win11 home downloaded via latest medium creation tool havent logged account internet connection computer shouldnt sort beta testing might try installing ubuntu check problem window need find compatible linux driver mb wifi
driver currently say installed ethernet card
ehh beta testing mean youre basically used lab rat microsoft pushed window 11 state even market people use especially last update brick pc use window 11 untill microsoft gather data people like unaware fix mess take like 12 year download window 10 use win11 like 30 pc market share come prebuild pc laptop installed default nobody us shit unless theyre unaware

yes thats great price mine 770 small sale normal price always 800
awesome deal
yes
paid new nonti 4070 super november id say go warranty coverage left look like there real drawback
warranty transfer ownership select partner ive never messed warranty register card soon buy new let say buy new card 1 year later remember warranty register 12 month ownership still get service
card good condition better value anything 50 series offer likely 5070 ti little faster 4070 ti memory config saving 150 losing full warranty near 5070 ti performance thats defensible choice imo
would snatch 4070 ti super kind deal cant go wrong fast card last another 5 year
good deal
brother share found good deal im looking one
yes
yes happy gaming
amd exists dont forget intel
99 percent new aaa garbage use gpu mainly encoding
know brand new 4070 ti super 600 local walmart doesnt show online guess one picked yet
really enough money saved justify warranty cant wait till 5070 ti come buy new 4070 ti super
buy 5090 jensen
really
honest right true hardware upgrade 50 series dp 21 hdmi 21 allows uncompressed hdr 120 frame 8k signal
bought 4070 super around 600 new best buy couple week ago everything sold
wait 9070 xt supposed around price 4080 super like performance
thats insane cant believe people willing pay 600 used video card
honestly ill wait 5070 549 usd 9070 xt supposedly around even cheaper
who seller get scammed
could wait rtx 5070 rx 9070 xt
yeah 5070 better better price
600 expensive please buy new one price range even want buy used gpu make sure used crypto mining
getting 4090 599
perfect answer op listen fact theyre even finding 4070 ti super warranty remaining receipt crazy
4090 performance lol ask jensen
depends game youre playing everyone hung vram maybe 5 game use 12g say case 12g rtx 3060 would outshine 8g 4060 doesnt mean doesnt use 12g vram 5070 outperform 4070 ti
gddr7 better 4k ray tracing
improvement memory speed optimization memory usage play big part believe 5070 outperform 4070ti application
suggestion comparable performance
uncompressed 8k eveyone imax screen home
getting 4070 ti super card huge difference
terrible advice nvidia far superior performance image quality thanks dlss also new dlss4 transformer model work rtx 4000 series much better previous model already
wait 2 month mediocre performance best fsr4 game support rdna2 great thats generation really worth rdna3 still extend bust pricing fsr3 disappointing widely available rt performance bad although drive ware good previous couple year 2024 plagued bug dont get fixed
maybe 6 month
youre crazy think get new 4070 ti 600 honestly good luck even finding new 4070 ti stock anywhere
pretty sure meant joke people downvoted lol
theyre getting 4060 thousand cuda core ai 599
fg xd
would much rather 3060 4060 anyways 5070 v 4070ts battle wont like according tpu database 4070ts 36 faster 4070 difference 4090 5090 really expecting jump 4070 5070 bigger 4090 5090 ya thats going happen keep mind 4070t 4070ts different card latter 10 faster
especially new dlss transformer model proven increase quality allowing fps less vram usage
192 bit bus wont
zero chance outperform 4070ts card talking
depending use 7800xt 7900xt comparable compete price energy efficiency plus
850 new basically getting everything sold new item still get restock notification one 4090s best buy well sign atleast
yea im sure people trying convince others wait card get super scalped minimal performance gain 4000s series reasonable price disappear 4070tis new youre paying around 850 600 2 year warranty receipt expensive
meant buy new different gpu 600 range 4070 even want buy used gpu 4070 strongly suggest confirm used crypto mining
people downvoted dont 600 4090
yeah getting 6090 ti super 8x frame generation 96gb vram 1
mfg yeah
would much rather 3060 4060 like didnt go thing usability rx580 8gb 1060 6gb way longer 4gb 3gb counterpart
proven report far dlss4 balanced offer similar image quality dlss35 quality assuming setting parity transformer model provide lower performance increase quality performance 11 comparison nvidia quite slippery always comparing different setting making marketing claim
picked new gigabyte 4070 ti 825 last month finally getting stock alert sold almost immediately glad got order time came 4 year warranty beast card far 50xx going impossible get foreseeable future unless youre stupid bot
crypto card better condition game used one plus nobody sell card middle market card one year old 2 year warranty original box receipt used card doesnt get better sound like legitimate guy selling card reasonable price wanting upgrade op def buy card since 50 series 1015 power b
nvidia slippery access new model new driver early
got 4070ts 830 newegg month ago never happier glad fortunate enough come across new one reasonable price
bad experience used gpu crypto nothing wrong card damn good deal also seller genuine like trying scam
pc crypto mining basically ended 91522 ethereum merge wasnt worth electricity crypto gpu 4070 ti super came strong reason buying used 40 series card used 30 series card
mining rig profitable electricity cheap mining gpu dead feasible cheap electricity free
free electricity 4070 make 25 cent day according nicehashcomhttpnicehashcom

7700x 7800x3d anything else make sense youre something else besides gaming really need extra core
could ever get 9800x3d msrp 469 would best possible price performance cpu comparing field am5 cpu find better deal 7800x3d save money get dont see 7800x3d going less 400 long time maybe good option 4k gaming youre going notice huge fps gain 9700x 9800x3d cpu becomes less relevant almost game

7700x upgrade next nextnextgen come youd get benefit 7800x3d youre paying 100 20 performance
difference price worth value question
youre starting see stock 9800x3d esp micro center im hopeful see 7800x3d price drop soon either way im probably gon na pick 7800x3d bundle cause 100 ish discount cpu seems rn dont live near micro center youre luck regarding 7800x3d price
price im follows 7700x320 7800x3d490 9800x3d590 sure price worth performance opinion
depends youand game play personally itd worthwhile play bg3 poe game tend cpu bottlenecked also play single player game smoothness important immersion x3d help lift low play mostly gpu bound game multiplayers pick whatever x3d premium product premium experience major difference game smoother fps rather higher fps
since 7800x3d came 7700x recommend reading x3d review include 7700x benchmark think performance delta two worth added cost go x3d

12400f around 10 performance 1080p real question move intel gaming could upgraded 3600x 5700x3d saved money changing motherboard gotten way better fps really bad upgrade
reformat drive install fresh version o ya
honestly bought pre built think cpu isnt better ryzen 5 3600x
barely better gaming 12400f little bit stronger really big waste money buying could bought 5700x3d new gpu instead would gotten significantly better fps probably couldhave bought better gpu
return prebuilt would good idea
besides try reinstalling gpu driver using ddu fresh installing end day 12400f significant upgrade 3600x theyre similiar kind difference think wow much better
didnt mention driver would download beforehand put usb would prepare another usb bios update could reuse usb copying content freshly installed o

yes shipping covered
mine came t1700 got cheap apparently people dont know flash bios support cpu xd
huh really maybe try sell old one
impression tpm 20 compatible chip required clean installation win11 100 sure
lol
voltage albeit slightly higher due overclock 6 pin draw max 75w 2 sata connector capable delivering 100w there real risk
fair 1650 itll probably barely exceed power provided pcie slot anyway

would definitely go 5700x3d dont buy new motherboard ram
similar issue am4 wanted go 5080 pcie 3 5080 pcie5 even though pcie backward compatibility would better am5 mobo would need upgrade ram cpu much money wasnt expecting spend kept am4 mobo got 4090 5700x3d
260e 5700x3d bit much youre europe access 7500f 170e 7700 oemtray 240e dont know youre 9600x bigger number better get 7600 performs close 9600x

5700x3d youll upgrading whole setup 5 year 9600x youll upgrading gpu 5 year neither bottleneck gpu spending v spending later
gaming two perform dont plan upgrading 9600x am5 get 5700x3d skip am5 get one aliexpress 150 less promos
afford go am5 otherwise youre running end life platform itll cost long run amd 5xxxx3d cpu
ryzen 5700x3d seems reached eol one sought cpu am4 platform would wager getting decent price line reasonable expectation might go sell year ready move money tight am5 solid platform

1 mix random set especially one rated different speed 2 subtimings differ even kit frequency paired exact model 3 ddr5 poorly 4 stick much harder run stable high speed especially without additional tinkering use 2 module unless need 6496 gb
using 4 slot mixed kit issue try using two faster ram a2 b2 see get higher speed need use 4 slot adjust thing manually plenty video guide
sticker see timing voltage exactly work timing doesnt
yes mixing ram bad practice cause issue
switching worked xmp get 5600mhz fps seems improved slightly well im getting roughly 1020 usual idk normal
glad worked
difference 4800 cl40 6000 cl30 roughly 1015
use am5 board cpu long compatibiliy list
check ram correct slot seated nicely
fact issue appears occur cold doesnt occur warmed would make think something little loose tightens warmth caused expansion course could way base crash behaviour display eg blue screen black screen abrupt shutdown frozen screen
theyre nice tight
display doesnt even get turn yet shuts nothing try always work second try
tried turning fast boot bios shutting safely end day user shutting power button happen
im gon na try turning fast boot im shutting via window
ram timing set bios
worth 13600k roughly par general gameplay 5700 slightly ahead heavily cpu bound game definitely upgrade rather even upgrade far little make sense spending much money problem build given ram extremely poor quality
perform worse cs2 one game benefit cache scale based pure ipc rather cache
imo yes stay intel go am5 yes dont go am4 case btw disgusting ramus never see one bad ddr5 ddr4 one far better edit seeing beachmarks lokks like yep uwinterkoalefant say even cheapest better ddr4
would probably improve framerate dip lot slapping 6000 cl 30 ram dont think worth spending money go am4 pixel loading crashing entirely separate issue probably monitorgpu maybe ram even malfunctioning
hey op really wouldnt worth youre stability issue 13600k intel increased warranty 13th 14th gen cpu two year afaik good rmas due degradation issue clarity though would getting money back current build whats happening current build unless current build going towards something need would recommend putting money am4 build
worth rid system much need keep ram next one
anything cpu outside 13th 14th gen cpu upgrade least reliability
hey fellow gater
im really sure cause issue honest im working excel program showing like graphical artifact part pixel doesnt loaded monitor im really sure explain also crash time time working guess little bit fed current setup want higher fps played game cs2 think x3d chip significantly achieve
indeed didnt much research ddr5 ram back built thinking changing 6000mhz cl32 plan am4 build think hold anyway think downgrade upgrade im kinda get mixed understanding thanks
ddr55200 worse ddr43200
thanks opinion begin think change ram right
well current build working pretty fine right plan use solely work productivity end build new setup gaming research rma processor though since kinda different process conventional seller
care elaborate crashing issue recently happened also gaming improvement aspect opinion
13600k never issue ask lot people online one didnt issue 13th 14th gen intel chip vastly seem outnumber one additionally issue look like 900 level series pc news travel fast space there lot hive mind
also crash time time working extremely worrying never happen bios date possible cpu irreversibly damaged excess voltage graphical artifact sign gpu failing cable monitor failing monitor issue could likely improve performance decent bit right proper ram one poor quality
id investigate hint towards graphicscard defect youd essentially downgrading still problem
9800x3d performs worse intel counterpart game like cs2 think need little research worth effort bad move
mean stay next build keep mind 6000mhz cl 3036 sweet spot btw apply micro fix 13 th gen cpu
could try memtest86 see current ram stable unstable ram result lot blue screen
here cpu scaling 1440p 5700x3d isnt 5800x3d theyre within 34 iirc 13600k dead even average httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen79800x3d19html really want second build gaming though happen microcenter within reasonable distance pretty great am5 bundle like 7700x mobo ram 400 9700x 430 7800x3d 600 httpswwwmicrocentercomsitecontentbundleandsaveaspx
case cpu shitting crap redditors pessimist act like every one pre existing build solid gaming
well 13 14th gen problem well documented google detail getting sued think x3d chip better gaming especially play certain game cpu intensive
end manufacturing flaw even smaller amount people affected amount market share intel still lot people affected also say happen really issue mentality
interesting part almost never get artifact graphical glitch playing game specific productivity work related program since setup havent tweak something could risk entire setup crash rarely happen mostly happened multitasking microsoft suite software ram think 6000mhz cl 30363676 proper
yes havent got chance go igpu road test keep mind thanks
see thought cs2 benefit significantly large cache chip thanks reply
kinda difficult find ddr5 ram cl 30 country least one afford im aware micro fix though mean mobo bios update microcode something crashing issue
ill keep mind however whether problem ram think eventually replace better one thanks
wish place like microcenter country bad bunch retailer cant even direct unit replacement principal case better save money build am5 onward thanks reply btw appreciate
see thanks opinion plan still use intel setup solely work productivity end build am4 setup
bios date yes 6000cl30 optimal amd intel 7200 good number
dont think gain faster ram worth see benchmark decide httpsyoutubertmbyak8ge besides overclocking ram even xmp risk instability probably figure crashing issue first would reset bios default run stability test example occt run recommended cpu test overnight fails contact intel could software issue
run benchmark 3dmark gaming load furmarkstresstest heaven benchmark medium load crash think safe say might gpu issue thats case look driver youre using amd driver version buggy af
he getting weird result benchmark get better result 9800x3d
ah yea microcenter godtier always ask there one nearby recommending part lol yea am5 would upgrade path even performance bump isnt high average 910 9800x3d 4090 obviously game like 3d cache going higher still dont know thats worth cost people might even best put money away wait see next am5 cpu even next intel cpu give larger boost 200 series seems proof concept anything else im hoping successor notable
latest bios version think might affected overvoltage issue since didnt update bios often might missed one released mitigation crashing issue im using b760m asrock steel legend btw
ill keep mind thanks
depends updated bios installed fix chip could potentially accumulate damage could also due faulty ram
case nothing much except rma cant prove issue since randomly happened crash graphical issue replicate specific use case anyway ram still use 6000mhz stick try overclock 7200mhz cl without instability suggest buy 7200mhz ram box yes cl optimal 7200mhz
absolutely 6000 kit 0 guarantee hit anything beyond certainly stable 7200 different 6000 term gaming performance least big jump 6000 7200 youd fine 6000 cl30 youd like reuse ram future every game reacts faster ram youre losing anything meaningful going 6000
better run 6000mhz manufacture xmp profile manually change clock speed manually yes meanwhile ill try research 7200mhz kit recommendation
driver updated
also weird issue going 3700x 5700x3d issue boot give ftpm yn selection page pretty annoying deal im thinking need update bios
gpu yes
bios issue ig try default setting bios
mobo cpu driver date updated cpu gpu
mean chipset driver updated
mobo
b450 aorus pro
unless cheaper expensive 5700x3d im sure youd buy 5900xt equal chip verified gpu running max pcie config monitoring temp used ddu wipe reinstall driver
ram speed isnt great made sure running 2666mhz bios instead default 2166mhz lot motherboards tend set
mostly could software tried fresh install window fresh install driver basically everything 0 save important file external hdd like photo document etc reinstall window win 11 work pc one big problem ppl upgrading pc dont fully uninstall reinstall driver quite picky even driver date fact changed processor throw make everything else move like sheit also bloatware stuff run background eats resource like ram processor maybe even gpu like chrome eats ram also try reseat everything pc make sure ram seated a2 b2second fourth slot left right slot a1a2 a1b2 b1b2 a2b1 human error happen also may properly read everything cureent gpu also adrenaline finicky well cause sort instability andor lag game whatever install driver cpu good also point time problem aura sync caused lag lot kind software cause lag think software issue clean install easily pinpoint issue
temp hitting helldivers 2 cpu gpu
last time fresh window install

kind storage device use hard drive ssd ssd kind ssd hardware general quite good play hard drive might bottleneck make thing meh would invest b550x570 mobo pci 4 maybe even faster ram like 3600 mt kit
better ram sure would also make sure bios date latest driver installed gpu motherboard
5700x3d v 5900xt baseboost clock speed 5900xt much higher 5700x3d thing 5700x3d 96mb l3 cache v 64mb l3 5900 figured higher clock speed would make lower l3 cache website read also agreed based read 5800x3d 5900 xt 5700x3d 5900x unfamiliar ensuring gpu running max pcie config look quick tip monitoring temp gpu sits around 6570 load cpu around 75 stable first got card used ddu wipe old nvidia driver installed recent stable nonbeta amd driver 7900xt 2420
original cpu 2700x like said probably old ram whey first built theyll need upgrade better kit
yes definitely 2666 keep trying oc 3200mhz xmp profiletiming must cause instability tend keep 2666
thinking fresh window 10 install potentially even going w10 enterprise extended support ive heard mixed thing 11 particularly regarding ad start menu well taskbar option less customizable considering im satisfied w10 didnt want switch yet fresh reinstall soon think installed adrenaline didnt know driveronly version software like way tune performance software also stability issue pc crash people saying 2407 recent stable version want roll back get started doesnt help ill remove adrenaline get driver ram 100 a2b2 slot ive made mistake past im certain right sapphire pulse 7900xt 20gb gpu enough handle aaa game max setting solid fps based know
cpu 75 stable gpu 6570
quite time ago youre first mention might next step
yes 30 slot im sure
build link using samsung 970 evo m2 might pro sure indeed thinking jumping b550 though ram slow would like get least 3600mhz next upgrade paycheck time
bios date amd radeon 2420 driver considered unstable say go 247 others say going 23 safer yet downgrade gpu driver soon report back update
5900xt fact worse 5700x3d rebranded 5950x performs worse game x3ds regarding gpu check use one two cable usually single daisychained cable lead worse performance gpu doesnt get enough power finally dont compare streamer fps usually dont show specific graphic setting upscaler impacting one
clock speed cant compensate cache easily shown difference 7800x3d 14900k also chip dual die design perform 5800x gaming cache shared 32mb per die download gpuz check temp seems fine nothing unusual
slightly newer replaced old ram 10th percentile stress test figured faulty got model saw decent improvement test performance much game performance know ram somewhat old like 20192020
alright 1080p 1440p 4k curiosity win11 shit 1 year ago quite problem new build well pc would randomly slowing could move mouse app would respond command force restart needed cuz tried normal taskbar restart would endless cycle waiting would never restart way force shut power drain fire play 2 hour litteraly let idle thing reverted fresh install back 10 bit back customisability issue mean move start menu left add turned litteral toggle switch win11 come 24h2 version improves experience 22h2 window 10 us stable enough sometimes mess happen unlucky crash smthing also used win 10 like 4 month upgrading win11 waited version 24h2 stabilises problem sometimes weird type crash high cpu utilization chrome high temp cpulike 79 fixed simple restart happens recently present new update rolled recommend full reinstall window maybe give win11 try customisability cheap key net legal way activating itfor company general find cheap key net background customisability always use wallpaper engine like 5 steam something arround thing dislike deactivated tube video easily understood even non techie hey gamer find way around stuff like recommendation cuz even ddu whatever may still miss one softs uninstall fresh win install guarantee nothing lag crash pc also recommend install gpu driver standalone software installs using amd app also cause problem ive seen heard
upgrading 11 may help performance due amd dual die design
hmmm check mean 1440 ultrawide 329 aspect ratio smt
also ive heard mixed thing daisychained cable say affect others dont psu high enough wattage ill also try switching 2 cable
keep hearing every benchmark comparison based submitted data show x3d marginally beat xt certain task xt beat everything else im sure am5 x3d chip blow water data im seeing show theyre practically slightly worse 5900xt else missing knowledgewise x3d
google searching maximizing pcie config seeing whole lot thats easy understand mind giving primer point right direction start looking
well assuming kit advertised 2666mts know fact xmp enabled id say ram upgrade wouldnt hurt 3600mts cl18 cl16 find kit isnt overpriced lot better less bottle neck system especially since dont x3d cpu
3440x1440 ultrawide probably fresh window install soon come back result thanks
yes 3440 x 1440 thats 329 though
gaming benchmark show x3ds better 1080p nongaming task nonx3ds better checked 1440p4k benchmark yes difference barely noticeable workload gpu cpu comparing cpu 1080p vast question simple answer thats see cpu better another workload
saying use userbenchmark never synthetic test necessarily produce real life result
download gpuz check
219 curious crazy high re tried helldivers driver httpswwwamdcomenresourcessupportarticlesreleasenotesrnradwin2441html older worth shot
yeah 244 247 version driver ive heard much better going ddu reinstall older driver today update
install rather using motherboard heat sink
go fan
board one m2 slot
back ssds heatsink would big
cant use one front
fan take ssds heatsink use motherboards one
sometimes removing invalidate warranty better use motherboard one get ssd without heatsink
would consider selling building completely new pc 500600 realistic pc new budget 1216k
honestly wan na go newer platform go am5 9800x3d
im eu lithuania exact
buy pc part amazon germany yes something like httpsdepcpartpickercomlist2bpdjnhttpsdepcpartpickercomlist2bpdjn would great upgrade
oh yeah like also think want sell pc part part keep liquid cooler forgot mention post id still use old case
want keep cooler case definetly might able get 250300 3070 i5 bundle maybe 150200 cpurammotherboard save aio ssd case 400500 build like httpsdepcpartpickercomlistyy9l4phttpsdepcpartpickercomlistyy9l4p could stick 1tb ssd upgrade later
yeah sound like good plan preciate much
playing upgrade everything one part time second one upgrade gpu later amd 9070xt might really interesting similar price 7900xt probably cheaper
im thinking 9070 released like march yeah planning upgrade somewhere around apriljune
yep march going dothe upgrade apriljune definitely go 9070xt
way realised old nzxt h210i itx maybe suggestion good itx motherboard
wont work board
mine pci gen 3
would recheck plugins secure change everything bios default run check
made upgrade build well started 7600x 3080 10 gb
ive cleared cmos already well latest bios driver date pc plugged serge protector ive never power fluctuation home know
multiple time course last week half issue persisted pretty much matter dont believe firmware issue anymore
yea seems psu issue another swap test mobo maybe ram tried single channel maybe reseating cpu know one time building computer tightened water block tight ended bending pin real finicky till could get new one idea best luck
ive performed memtest86 came 0 error well test think reseat cpu due water block tight help right single channel next thank
congrats money burn
unlikely youll able get one launch
keep itstill good gpu
5070ti almost definitely price judging 5090 nv isnt making founder edition 5070ti msrp doesnt mean anything 5090s going anywhere 300 800 aibs scalping assuming nv margin consistent percent wise stack would prepared pay kind premium top whatever youre getting back 4070ti super long youre comfortable reality potentially paying bit make difference id say go
5070 ti going roughly 1520 faster 4070 ti super basically equivalent 4080
thanks input everyone think ill hold onto 4070 ti super see far future hold
5070 wont beat unless want use multi frame gen course 5070ti would probably comparable dont know sure 5070ti least see couple hundred buck expensive even could get msrp potentially raw performance feature id probably keep 4070ti super 5070ti seems like gamble nothing
thats meant get youre saying im looking performance longevity bang buck important 5090 solution expensive
oh understood like said slow build
thanks input
good know thanks
ok thanks ill look
ok yeah terribly interested mfg linuss demo showed flaw made think might give motion sickness lol
well youve come internet tell u spent 700 gpu youre sure want there newer gpus fact theyre 1500 2500 doesnt bother want best value performance since internet told 5090 isnt worth unless money burn suddenly 2500 problem spend
kind budget
depends budget easy upgrade getting 5700x3d compatible motherboard ram need bios update huge upgrade gpu depends much willing spend 1440p60fps could check 4070 7800 xt perhaps one newer upcoming gpus though itll depend power consumtion
honestly budget isnt biggest concern care upgrading least amount part possible id say could upgrade gpu around 500 get performance im looking would perfect dont want almost get whole new pc yeah also looking spend 1k gpu hahaha
thinking 4070 4060 think went 4060 ot would good upgrade worth instead go 4070 also build pc never upgraded maybe silly question would getting 4070 compatible would need new motherboard
maybe 5700x3d intel b580 upgrade bios around 500ish getting better gpu would probably need better psu itll bottlenecked 3600
go 4070 yes compatible
yes nothing afraid turn pc switch psu unplug hold power button second open pc unplug gpu remove screw likely lever mobo need push get gpu install ssd put everything back together
pretty straight forward ugonstrocz explained youre still super nervous could always add 25 sata ssd instead

got cpu mixed 5 11600kf budget around 250 going return mobo get asus prime h510mk
upgrading worth need new cpu motherboard ram upgrade 11600kf 12400f worth overall lga 1700 platform really worth currently still good platform dead one cant upgrade future anymore best pick would switching amd am5 platform would expensive
see thank help
suggest selling desktop really worth upgrading long laptop doesnt overheat monitor setup nicer i5 3rd gen rx 550
thank ill buy new 22inch monitor think ill save upgrade later give nephew get older might able use school gaming
yep sound good
used ideally
built pc 12100f 3060 ti fe got 280 buck ebay preowned theyre even cheaper month ago 16 gb ram swapped 32 gb set dont need 16 fine b760m motherboard asrock think overspent stupid board like idiot h610 enough cheaper whole build totaled 810 dollar get cheaper motherboard get better deal 3060 ti could get price 700 problem oh also used stock intel cooler corsair power supply 650 watt pop mini silent case fractal design

mean 9000 gen overall slightly improved generation 9600x faster 7600x consuming 40w less got faster consuming less power enable 105w mode newer bios install newest version ipc improvement good didnt make huge difference gaming use case like photoshop improved bigger margin definitely recommend enabling mode make cpu inefficient
make sense thanks review read complaining small gain performance compared previous generation perhaps without taking consideration power gain
ok still get signal board graphic
thats using turned pc wouldnt show signal anymore
turn integrated graphic bios
couldnt thats trying get bios happened
get display graphic card
couldnt get display gpu beforehand hence trying get bios change integrated graphic gpu

am5 amd question
am5 9700x lulz 9700k 9700x 9950x max perf want cheaper alternative look 7xxx ryzens 7700x 7900x could consider intels newest gen platform probably dead quirk mainly gaming perf thats surprisingly worse current last gen cpu bios issue though probably fixed one would hope
7950x3d give load rendering performance gaming performance similar 7800x3d currently second best possible gaming cpu wait bit 9950x3d due soon even better dont want full 16 core cpu rest lineup am5 still really good 9800x3d reign supreme game
am5 best right
guess ill go amd everyone said ahah short money right dont want upgrade pc near future ill bite bullet go 9950x recommendation motherboard
aah wonderful im sucker top performance embrace 9950x3d advjce motherboard go
one good thing am5 platform still alive least 2027 according amd could mean next gen cpu launch could want save money get cheaper am5 cpu upgrade future newer faster one mb get depends largely much connectivity need b650850 x670870 chipsets feature difference connectivity dont use many pcie card nvme drive b650b850 model enough save money would cost 150200eur b650 x670 require bios update supporting 9xxx ryzens good model bios flashback isnt really issue
check smt x3d mode moba enabled disabled want play multiple instance well smt enabled x3d mode reference balanced powersaving mode also run best 9800x3d well
run benchmark make sure cpu gpu used correctly turn xmp bios see help xmp issue still want slightly increase ram voltage see stabilises personally run issue ddr57800x3d gigabyte mobo
option bios thank
fixed project lasso instance balancer order evenly spread processing core cpu
bios every brand different name probably revolves around x3d mode like gaming turbo mode something
please let know fix issue plan get identical build also play mmorpgs would nice solution run
ah ok assigning core one game instance weird behaviour couldnt assign manually task manager 7950 7900x3ds manually didnt enable xbox gamebar window gave negative perception disable xbox gamebar also assign core evenly since xbox gamebar would automatically put x3d core one game instance least thats hypothesis
returning anyone future problem fixed downloading project lasso find game youre trying run multiple instance right click select instance balancer select spread core evenly add exit game restart tada
trying tonight couple hour let know
think task manager every time start pc lasso permanently save may wrong
o7 thank service
issue x3d disabled already running idea
new monitor looked monitor setting maybe going power save mode
monitor strange 3 monitor game client running monitor 1 2 clicked onto monitor 3 game run perfect capped 144fps click one game drop less 5fps like system cant handle there something causing secondary game throttled 2 game running
monitor running hz
definitely seems like priority type setting
friend fixed omg need download project lasso boot whatever game run multiple instance find game world warcraft project lasso right click select instance balancing select spread core evenly exit game restart force game run evenly core cpu working absolutely flawless

small incremental increase raster performance 5060 may worth wait 6700xt would nice uplift
wait 5060 used price drop 5060 performance come decide thats im right

yeah roughly 6700xt performance wise 6700xt vram though
yes also close 3070 edit read 3060 non ti
thing know motherboards first chipsets find information amd am5 chipsets httpswwwamdcomenproductsprocessorschipsetsam5htmlhttpswwwamdcomenproductsprocessorschipsetsam5html basically chipset control sort feature board higher end board usually higher quality power delivery stuff like could also feature like better error code something wrong display v simple light stuff like also sizing play big part atx matx itx different size bigger board feature accomidate also increase board cost although itx board also expensive pack much stuff little space matx usually sweet spot
good b650 bios update good b850 board
look good would make 2 change though crucial ssd isnt great money 2 ssds would rather grab really good 4tb ssd either fine add 1tb ssd window second thing cooler go phantom spirit 13 money noctua cooler slightly better small percentage nowhere near worth 3x price price performance
thanks advice cooler ssds would u recommend 1tb window better deal 2tb crucial gaming
httpsdepcpartpickercomlist6xr8jnhttpsdepcpartpickercomlist6xr8jn price 2x2tb ssds youve picked
fine spending slightly could fit newer am5 platform httpsdepcpartpickercomlistxdhjjnhttpsdepcpartpickercomlistxdhjjn faster cpu slightly cheaper cooler newer better motherboard faster ram better ssd gpu cheaper case cheaper psu
1 5600 come cooler double check dont need aftermarket one 2try 3600mhz ram kit almost price 3you dont need 750w psu 500w enough aim 600w breathing room saved money get better gpu
mean guess id try haggle price bit though
thats lot money buy enthusiast class gpu like warranty feel like gambling would seriously consider something safer price
bought suprim x 4090 2000 cad see liquid suprim x 4090 1950 right locally bought mine asked installed running benchmark hwinfo sensor checked 30 min chatted liked saw bought wouldnt buy box though edit listing 2200 2400 bought mine offered 2000 also yes would get 4090 5080
rtx 4090 warranty might better think ought shave 200 price leave exact price make sense
personally wouldnt much risk used part without warranty wait 5080 spend ebay go make sure test hour person benchmark stress test game etc
hell buy 5080 overclock probably get 5 4090 melt warranty go 5080
4090 still powerful card ai stuff 50 series coming 40 series well would ask seller test card ensure work buy
buy bigger number like ps5 youre busy tv looking eye sore
wouldnt expect 5080 beat 4090 around price mention
get 5080 super
might warranty
thanks advice
well wait see leaked benchmark show 5080 closer 4080 super 4090
saw showing 5080 15 higher 4080 super
attack shark r1 attack shark x3 aliexpress
wait rtx 5070 rx 9070xt review 7800xt might remain good value dont know yet
yeah thinking also think pcie 3 b450 would significant bottleneck new gen gpus need worry 1080p
using 7900gre 450 tomahawk 30 v 40 shit barely 2 fps worst case
definitely pcie scaling actually bit counterintuitive midrange highend card lose 12 performance per pcie generation sufficient vram constantly offloading system ram card low vram like rx 6500xt rtx 3050 6gb actually impacted need move data bus often
nice 1
one inside motherboard called nvme m2 standard much faster traditional sata ssd yes technically get sata m2 plug motherboard regarding ram long timing fine run lower one speed
thank generation affect compatibility also ssd drive get cheap
generation nvme backwards compatible ssds got really cheap last 3 year pretty affordable back 2020 point dont recommend hdd anyone anymore

go used rx6600 run 500w psu upgrade
get wan na try frame mainly used intel cuz shape cause warping thermal paste gradually cover entire thing thats case
also think look neat ifwhen decide replace cooler think might pick one funsies
nope
purely look
got plastic one noctua buck bought thermal paste cant see since headsink maybe keep paste neater
yeah saw
look alr would buy decoration lol
budget isnt problem wait couple week 50 series card
noctua fan case presumably case piece must have going put together find best value pc part picker budget
mean rgb
theyre going really expensive australia 4080 super enough game want play
4080 super 9800x3d sure like look fractal case suggestion would great
yes every pad replaced one match stock thickness stock pad usually reused unless damaged dried due overheating capacitor haveneed thermal pad mosfets component vrm actually produce heat inductor thermal pad help sink bit extra heat gpu core would strongly recommend ptm7950 unlike normal thermal paste doesnt pumpout heat cycle meaning following month year dont gradually rising temperature p check gpu backplate thermal pad adding blowing air across backplate decrease vram vrm temperature degree
thats incredibly outdated cpu worth buying price

would anyone exchange 6700 xt rtx 4060
used 3080 right price
used 3080 probably best choice 3 vram two 4060 grade 6700xt tbh 5060 par 6700xt raster 3080 thing thats real upgrade also dropping 80 fps fortnite 6700xt normal partner pc gpu cpu comparable 5700x3d average 170 fps fortnite there wrong system switching nvidia isnt going change recently upgrade 6700xt remove driver old card ddu
6700xt slightly better 4060 among choice 3080 best imo would keep current gpu save budget significant upgrade
3080 option id stick save little longer
get 3080 sub 300 max 350 beat raster
likely cpu amd gpus never really great fortnite fortnites cpu intensive game selling gpu waste
likely considerably slower 4070 somewhere 4060 4060
amd gpus known issue running dx11 fortnite high stable framerates cheapest nvidia option new sale around 400ish usd
built system right 2 year ago fps problem isnt present im creative running around match get fight fps drop 100 im 280hz monitor really affect gameplay
think im going hold upgrade save cpu gpu upgrade something like 9800x3d 5070ti
think changing cpu something like 9800x3d solution problem
3080 comparable 4070 boil title since op mentioned used 3080 im assuming price quite bit cheaper new 4070 5070
rest spec also setting game ray tracing nanite turned fortnite id sure turn
good plan
oh definitely fortnite love 3d cache im 7800x3d 3070 im able play medium setting 240
new 4070 around 750800usd thats cheap version 3080 used found low 300usd mined gpu conversation bit concerning though
upgrading bigger curved monitor resolution increase instance 3440x1440 resolution ultrawide monitor increase gpu need biggest bottleneck imo gpu however cpu isnt faring much better itll expensive upgrade say am5 youd need cpu mobo ram depends play well ive quite bottleneck time 9600k overclocked id suggest newer gpu first followed cpu upgrade willing spend money 5070 id recommend waiting benchmark 9070xt upgrade isnt urgent seems like amd gearing dominate midrange market another 15 month away
didnt know likely priciest bottleneck cpu i9 9900k still robust processor modern day game getting cpuintensive mean i9 9900k may perform well latest title particularly 1440p getting rtx 3060 3070 would make difference however paired modern cpu one would see even benefit assuming looking break bank yet look something like intel core i713700k amd ryzen 7 7700x cpu definitely match well new gpu hopefull solve smoother gaming experience issue
8gb vram budget
id recommend upgrading gpu reaching nice new monitor youre really going kicking
gpu p switched rtx2070 super rtx4070ti httpswwwyoutubecomsyneticsilvervideoshttpswwwyoutubecomsyneticsilvervideos made video 1440p maybe help decide 1440p jump ryzen 7 9800x3d isnt worth expensive right low setting 1080p different thing iam fine 8auer try new 5090 fe pci30 lose 6 older slot even fine would max pair i9 9900k rtx5080 1440p 4k gaming casual player
yeah today 2560x1440 bit jump dont know accurate look task manager gaming cpu ram practically never high range game lagging reduce graphic setting thing get smoother thats figure gpu swapped first amd something similar dlss4 might wrong ive gotten impresson nvidia always extra feature dont get amd card young building pc intelnvidia fanboy might stick even tho im mid 30
philosofy general chase upgrade every second year part 2019 stood good since im buying gpu cpu want buy something hold 45 year buying 30xx feel like buy new card 2 year id rather buy good gpu cpu mb fall
understand mindset im 30 started pc building 16 intelnvidia exclusive 10 year come cpu time gaming reason go intel price performance temperature power consumption amd better time gpus tend get better value amd come native rendering vram lose quite bit upscaling ray tracing cant say much ray tracing 9000 series claim promising benchmark matter however hardware unboxed get first look fsr 40 seemed really promising boil much want pay additional feature personally prefer raw performance upscaling capability performance hit ray tracing worth
here suggestion id like put forward upgrade gpu nvidia rtx 4080 card expensive deliver adolius performance year come excellent high refresh 1440p gaming superb ray tracing amd radeon rx 7900 xtx another powerful option value friendly robust performance 24gb future proofing vram great budget well little less powerful rtx 4080 autumn upgrade cpu motherboard cpu look towards latest release amd intel amd ryzen 9 7950x intel core i913900k look great paper perfom best provide excellent future proofing motherboard make great combination amd gigabyte aorus master intels asus rog maximus board good feature allow future expandability well upgrade memory ram 32gb ddr4 2666mhz solid consider upgrading ddr5 get new cpu motherboard even better performance allows maximize efficiency great gpu enjoy powerful performance boost next season mention wont worry updated well
good input ill wait amd card release make fair adjustment ive looked raytracing gaming store felt like made huge difference im big fan good graphic example played rdr2 highest possible setting whilst still somewhat smooth id rather sacrifice fps better view 120fps shitty graphic day chased 500 fps csgo still sucking as past enjoy slow paced single player coop good graphic
thanks gpt 3
look like probably legit cheaper enough local retailer even au worth waiting 10 amazonhttpswwwamazoncomauarcticmx6conductivitynonconductivenoncapacitivedpb09vdl3cw6 chinese new year holiday youll minimum 1 week wait get processed ever normal shipping time
mean thermal paste outside thermal grizzly pretty cheap take risk save couple buck
supposed know much would saving buying temu cant buy amazon
idea still compound thats decade old easily tube compound got heatsinks havent used squeeze initial dried stuff use still good portion say drive home long thing last time wise get several application worth spend dollar make sure get legit product
buying thermal paste
little half much retailer amazon even tryna save money
bruh like 8 buck amazon really trying risk save like 4 buck
trying save money thats tube give multiple us going save like 4 potentially get counterfeit junk
get saving cash think anything related rig id rather pay little get somewhere reliable know thermal paste tradeoff potentially pay twice much legit probably big enough saving worth waiting reckon
went overboard 1200watt psu thinking would waste luckily 5090 7950x3d gon na usable 1000 watt would borderline little case go 1k watt gpu power usage increasing every generation
850w psu work fine current setup even future upgrade 1000w psu let rest assured give option later since price difference small afford consider going 1000w psu might good option
never bad headroom pc part last 10 year 2015 bought 850w evga g2 supernova everyone said overkill paid like 20 650w time fast forward today build would longer work today recommend 1000w higher end build outside 5090 thats enough even work 5090 use power hungry cpu
whats spec 1000w kinda overkill
still running 13700k 4070 super 500w
price gap less equal 50 go ahead
buying 1000w psu may overkill future may need 1000w besides plan upgrade whole system psu case 2 main part still usable 10 year
thing lose getting bigger psu money afford think youll upgrading future sure depends think future upgrade look like though youre planning upgrading 8090 intel 17th gen 7 year maybe 1000w wont enough
like safe psu cheap reason edge rather headroom power spike upgrade
dude really figure
bruh powering pc
guess people tend overestimate power consumption might due online psu calculator offered psu manufacturer theyre biased
shit put shoe box lol covid cu case ordered stuck stupid shipping container strike mine box till got worked great
happened month ordered part 23rd december waited gpu last week huge pile box room entire time worth wait also found later cpu integrated graphic could actually used pc entire time worth checking
cpu integrated graphic could breadboard mobo sitting top box get pc running could put gpu well arrives case
yes cpu integrated graphic worried putting aio reapplying thermal paste case arrives also toddler want avoid danger open fan etc said rant thanks letting know alone
argb hub wont work take argb input motherboard split control need something like httpswwwamazoninwavenexheatsinkcontrollermagneticbackplanedpb0drthzb9p software argb controller talk argb port motherboard sometimes usb limited register software talk standalone controller
get higher end fan like lian li nzxt corsair connect via rgb hub usb header use software control rgb
seem like theyre one posted one
dont budget 3 pack fan nzxt cost like 100150 buck getting 2 cooler master fan 3 fan already come preinstalled case
take closer look one posted integrated controller
buy em used core fan like 20bhcks used make sure fan used since mobo doesnt argb header going suck get work
yes yes sorry doesnt ship location ill look something else could please recommend smth
dont see used fan country hell even used cpu gpus rare
great happy white part cost 15x
lol wish case live
suffering success
well case yes cost less time black pc would overall cheaper white cause white gpu psu expensive black one
please stop racist
guy say dislike white part want black pc would bad thing
3060 bottlenecked cpu unlikely much performance lose since im using pcie 40 gpu either case pcie 30 none maybe 12 compare price 3060 12gb 8gb 7600 4060 older 6600xt6650xt card perform similarly get cheaper
12gb zotac twin edge 3060 7600 6600
7600 6600 get saying see find one gpus list cheapersame price
oh alr thanks
rx6800 16gb
always get used card imo wait benchmark new gpus decide buy
wait 9060
hit miss situation think new card amd nvidia good fair priced amd overpriced nvidia definitely market come immediately there argument seller side keep price steady 6700 xt however card way overpriced part performance deliver see used market fighting keep 6700 xt price summer maybe said rtx 50 although rebranded 40 series think going first rtx card thats really going take leap mark big first step think future gpus heavy use ai performance improvement optimized dlss tech without rellying power consumption hardware rtx 30 powerful inefficient rtx 40 powerful efficient software tech 4090 blend monster power tech opinion 50 series going amazing maybe taken extreme term hardware intelligent come frame generation advanced dlss power management think going hit day one despite hate mockery thats rolling around nvidia lied u see three type people picking new card nvidia one cant afford one happy competitive player dont like fake frame may difference firing bullet hair enemy amd go havent read much honestly coming offering big raw power fair price going success also biggest belief nvidia going steal lot amd user 50 series gen foresee card good techsoftwareoptimization wise go nvidia even raw power big jump 40 series truck thought head advice dont wait card release rx 5700 xt 6700 xt sml difference used market price think 5700 xt finally fall 100125 6700xt keep 100 price difference find good deal right around 250 card look good shape try bring 225 waiting march maybe save 2550 dont think worth better look good deal card look mint sure doesnt appear keep looking march appears dont loose btw im also looking maximum 250 card used market 6700 xt easiest find rtx 3080 12gb would steal 250 think best bang buck card reason buy low vram consider 3080 yes wait release 50 series
bought rx 6700 xt 225 yes 3080 great also cost 400 used live option think extra 4gb vram come clutch modern game sof today next year look 1 low fram rate stats many new demanding title designed 8gb mind stuttering issue higher framrates 3080 delivers 12 gb isnt optimal either ill start earning money next year upgrade point quite soon anyways 2 year probably think stuttering really annoying 90 fps average 3080 look smooth 70 fps average slightly higher 1 low go 6700 xt
made really good investment year time feel like upgrading youll lose maximum 75 card maybe 50 50 one year gaming card push 60fps ultra 1440p demanding game think great value yeah 3080 really come short vram shame card powerful saw one 350 gigabyte supposedly still 1 year warranty go idk really pass buyer read company friendly others dont give warranty think law different budget plus idk psu could handle hot card playing recent aaa constantly stuttering said plus heat kill memory much drawback 3080 12gb 300 warranty think id jump yeah think reasonable investment right really 6700 xt 12gb enough get started also gta6 come next year guess sell card 175 put money 6800 xt 16gb
download driver onto usb drive another machine networking boot machine safe mode install wifi driver reboot continue driver update via wifi connection
lot stuff ssd currently window c tho delete
mean usb flash drive ssd plug machine ethernet get networking temporarily unplug wifi driver
ohh driver undertanad
want avoid bottlenecking form literally impossible get best gpu reasonably afford though something expensive like rtx 5080 could probably upgrade whole pc 1440p high refresh see benefit gpu even r5 5500 bought cpu upgrade r5 5500 weakest ryzen 5000 cpu slow midrange ryzen 3000 part game bought something like 5600 5600x isnt much expensive might consider exchange b580 doesnt play nice slower cpu game
came ryzen 3 3100 loved thing wasnt supposed upgrade still going strong decided pas friend ryzen 5 5600 substantially expensive 5500 country demand high retailer able get away chose 5500 offer best price performance ratio im located well least amd im familiar intels current cpu line maximum budget gpu 300 dont really care specific frame rate whatnot finer detail irrelevant long title play run smoothly
well least amd im familiar intels current cpu line would also involve new motherboard would destroy priceperformance ratio youre already upgrading insocket am4 regarding gpu havent yet mentioned country youre assuming usa pricing market availability id recommend either b580 hope fix driver overhead issue slower cpu fair dont crop game secondhand 6700xt 6750xt
thanks lot ill definitely jump b580 70 get call guy theyre stock also im philippine pc part bit expensive u tax included price tag dont need shell beyond anything beyond whats tag
mean ddr4 ram 3700x am4 whats budget

gaming focus 5700x3d perform 5800x one paired 4070 super great understand 5700x3d 5ish lower performing discontinued 5800x3d
wait 5700x3d sale 100 must mean like 250 thats absurd
get x3d dont spend httpswwwozbargaincomauproductamdryzen75700x3d
gaming main focus
go 5700x3d tray version aliexpress something
look benchmark mainly game cant much better am4 5700x3d
im sure notice much difference two gpu x3d gpus tend help already pushing lot frame however upgrading higherend gpu soon id go 5700x3d
alright cheer ill likely get x3d
yeah last 5 also 100 difference know cuz 5800x3der know 100 5 better
think theyll actually go sale im concerned may production anymore get expensive cant afford one rn hoping get one month two
idk long could waiting tho 5700x 270 sale rn get 5700x3d rn 400 australian dollar
alright sadly deal expired stock
yes use pc 70 gaming like 30 random stuff like watching stream youtube looking thing
yeah looked thing wanted advice real person another view ty think x3d next cpu
sure ill upgrading gpu honestly next upgrade probably new pc im ready think noticeable difference
cheer everyone pretty much said thing go x3d gaming main use
check aliexpress buy rated seller might save bit money 5700x3d
say currency first place 100 usd far different aud clue cheap 5700x3d 180
im boat mate au price 350 waited 400 ive got 3700x gimping 3080 still lot cheaper get 5700x3d sell pc year spend 1000 am5 400 still crazy 5700x3d tho thinking
set trigger email deal come also look price ali express im showing save money dude
id say worth get x3d chip much better gaming performance completely fine everything else
would go 5800x dont think notice difference configuration lot people recommending 5700x3d arent considering pair 3060 ti mentioned gpu push lot frame cpu start bottleneck 3060 ti rarely able outperform 5800x
bite bullet lot people suggested ali express ive never ordered anything recent review throwing 100 trustable might
im going get 5700x time since im running 3060ti difference wouldnt big going 5700x 5700x3d im looking 100 frame per second nice little upgrade hold stability fps game better yes sadly missed sale 5700x3d
didnt know thankyou honestly thinking ali express decent amount recent review saying didnt get item cant receive refund might wait little longer deal ill order scorptec something
alright ty likely spend extra 100
thank ill definitely looking since around 140 aud cheaper also decent sale 5700g taking consideration
100 trustable wont warranty buy vendor thousand review good ratio return anything well within period youll able verify issue cpu cpu dont tend fail randomly month use
alot budget baller buying 5700x3d ali express
yeah thats fair enough good luck hope trick
call mostly reliable get choice item come quick check seller ive bought prob 100 thing ali time 2 didnt arrive happen pretty good
5700x 140 cheaper 5800x 100 cheaper 5700x3d
seen still little worrying
thank id suggest upgrade youre spending much am4 upgrade am5 youre also happy thats even better ill probably mentioned save sell rig whole new one pay extra 1000 am5 overall better pc
ill definitely look ali express theyre good sale might like 50 might order site ive used
5700x 5800x server basement 5700x run lot cooler lower tdp lower clock practice pretty close workload difference may benefit higher clock game depends game like play lot simulation game get 5800x citiesskylines 2 instance mostly gpu bound esports title either probably fine
okay looked thing going link 3 video basically comparison setup proposing compared going end several section game looking average fps 1 low example looked 5700x3d almost never outperforms 5800x paired 3060 ti dont think worth extra money instance 5800x didnt actually outperform 5500 average fps much lot title exception like competitive shooter however show pretty drastic increase 1 low often much better indicator smooth game experience 5800x3d also performed better 5500 5700x3d using dlss quality cp 2077 probably due increase raw processing power two based video think go 5800x almost certainly improve gameplay experience 5500 save money 5700x3d would perform similarly situation video linked 5500 httpsyoutubex8accw93qdisiexqw7jvie6ulm8dvhttpsyoutubex8accw93qdisiexqw7jvie6ulm8dv 5700x3d httpsyoutubem931o07vzuusis87yzomocyd2ynamhttpsyoutubem931o07vzuusis87yzomocyd2ynam 5800x httpsyoutubeuwzcv4fgwmasiowkd9alyfsccr9ehttpsyoutubeuwzcv4fgwmasiowkd9alyfsccr9e
type game usually play
always check review guaranteed actually legit scammed
thanks mostly play esport game like fps occasional minecraft input taken consideration
thank much youre legend ill go look video take everything said consideration making cpu purchase
siege dead daylight little cod minecraft little game im running fine atm
yeah lot arent promising tbh
would stay away unrated seller one like less 10 rating
ive got 1700 motherboard look like could use 14900k upgrade one rare case buy 14900k non gaming production workload really good almost much compared intels xeonw ryzen also good youd spending way achieve similar performance replacing motherboard ram make sure either high end cpu cooling dont mind chip running really hot time put load thermal throttle cooling cant handle wont harm chip performance drop might expecting
get 14900k remember update bios get brand new cpu
yeah make sure update bios get 14900k whats current cpu cooler
yeah 14900k current price amazing cpu heavy workload productivity plus price motherboards better amd equivalent youre saving even money
definitely upgrade 14900k
please please please update bios latest version get 14900k youre rare use case cpu make sense without microcode update via bios damage via overvolting especially prevalent burst high intensity single core workload
sound like upgrade 14900k best option bad reputation degradation issue make sure get new one used one make sure update bios using thing consider also get pretty hot power hungry full load current cooler adequate enough headroom another 150w current psu said take close look workload 14900k best cpu current platform use might best option use case workload make use avx512 instruction set platform switch amd might cost effective
14900k youre planning upgrading motherboard arguably one best productivity cpu still especially considering price creeping steadily
op could try setting power limithttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewintelcorei914900kraptorlaketestedatpowerlimitsdownto35w2html 125w half power draw full load give anywhere 8090 performance multithreaded workload would help keep thermal check slight undervolt also may also useful 95w undervolt almost match 125w
really appreciate one thing motherboard ddr4 3200mhz cl18 ram im sure price performance difference might setting future completely changing motherboard ram well im looking double price difference opinion there huge difference ddr4ddr5 point might 14900k otherwise ill spend extra moeny new motherboard ddr5
ddr4 14900k totally fine especially youre concerned gaming performance
pc intended gaming need upgrade every component eventually gpu outdated able run last generation game 1080p cpu mobo combo extremely outdated im sure ram ddr3 combo also outdated upgrade component may need beefier psu havent seen psu listed upgrade component pc constantly power psu trying keep demand happened old intel gen4 setup 750 upgraded quick edit cpu somewhat beefy first component upgrade gpu interested gaming cpu somewhat keep bare mind locked ddr3 ram
360 got essentially i7 10700 gtx 1080 really got ripped i7 4790 maxed socket might able get performance putting rtx 3060ti something nature sorry man thats quite sad
shouldnt bought 300
sound like ill return
yeah
within return window thats great
id prioritize gpu 7900xt little bit 7800xt keep 9800x3d might fine going 9700x jumping 7900xtx nvidia equivalent considered well availability becomes issue everything else look solid see constantly dont need liquid cooler could shave little well different folk different preference last thing youre set cpu gpu make sure 750 watt enough might need jump 850 watt though combination fine range
swap cooler artic 320 aio cheaper better performance also swap motherboard b650 dont need x870 mb also cheaper get cheapest m2 1tb gen 4 game dont run faster slightly faster m2 finally get 7800x3d instead 9800x3d look around youll find one save money money save thing put gpu gpu gaming performance work perfectly 7800x3d fun enjoy
downgrade getting x3d cpu maybe 7800x3d 9700x
ill keep wattage requirement mind looking make adjustment elsewhere save little splurge gpu dropping 9700x massive 150 cheaper
couldnt find arctic 320 used 240 place holder went cheaper mobo havent touched m2 drive yet noticed 7800x3d 9800x3d nearly price odd like 6 difference worth dropping 9700x save 150 go say 7900xtx httpspcpartpickercomlistgqy7v4httpspcpartpickercomlistgqy7v4
havent shopped around yet partpicker telling 7800x3d 6 cheaper 9800x3d thought odd much downgrade 9700x would save 150

try get ssd heatsink attached heatsink thats motherboard really bulky im sure size work gpu
try transferring heatsink near cpu check issue putting gpu mobo model heatsink us heatsink anyway
sorry confusion attached image plus version motherboard motherboard almost without additional heatsink anyway youre right let try relocating heatsink gpu side see gpu still fit otherwise might go built heatsink ssd
actually fit there another shield similar height something else sitting behind gpu there plenty room
fractal torrent best one found beautiful big awesome airflow included fan ever want case watch gamers nexus review watch case review
httpsaupcpartpickercomlistjqtbtm better faster cpu better stable ram less money ssd also identical performance less better bigger cooler less didnt change case changed mobo better higher quality one better power delivery m2 slot etc changed psu better one one japanese capacitor also read rme psus bit noisy fan nothing bad still gpu suggestion get rtx 5080 week
thanks info thought rme psu power effecient quieter ill read bit seems people recommending new 5080 might wait hopefully get
like said written picked part suggestion build go least decent mobo cooler seen post posted someone literally suggested cheap cooler budget good mobo recommended pc 4 tb ssd sure weird ask much worse quality wise dont feel safe msi psu change back corsair however would get msi one dont cheap cooler mobo suffer already see want use long time upgrability feature decent mobo picked needed pc likely 4 m2 slot without bandwidth lose even free x4 slot extra card like capture card stuff western digital sn850x samsung 990 pro pretty much identical quality didnt want use something else match build
appreciate feedback thank im hoping get good 10yrs new build
hopefully upgrade part boom relevant like cpu upgrade gpu even add pcie 50 ssd get relevant cheap etc btw msi mpg 1000g psu 10y warranty corsair rm1000e 7y wanted point
component draw 400w peak wall stress test scenario typical 250w estimate way overkill high end 450w psu would work without issue 50 unit like thishttpswwwneweggcomp1hu00z0000u1 handle
oh really got recommended psu wattage asus graphic card straight asus website wont actually need
thats generous overestimate dont accidentally try plug card something explode also there plenty cpu draw 23x power exist general overestimate recommended psu requirement
5090 tdp 575 lol 650 including whole system dont end using 6070 psu max w becomes inefficient regardless advice go higher w dont want replace upgrade later afford go 800 even 1000 give enough breathing room

dang psu got specific gpus work cuz low voltage cable budget 125 dollar gpu dont want play intense game got ps5 want online game like fortnite like dbz xenoverse 2 shinobi striker etc wouldnt need p plus
j upgrade
need high amp surge protector really high power appliance plugged high amp outlet youre plugging common household outlet going high amp wiring high amp outlet dont need high amp surge protector since psu wont ever access anything beyond standard 15a
youd actually better served ups uninterruptible power supply functionality surge protector internal battery would also offer protection brown out give time properly shut computer save work case total power loss brown out hell higher power draw system tend recommend ups option
thats great point depends breaker rating
see recommendation lot get really pricey higher wattage recommend also high power draw system vulnerable
main factor didnt mention budget upgrading 5700x3d building new cheapish am4 system likely cheaper upgrading cpu significantly boost performance 3080 depends game cpu intensive game youll definitely see improvement 5700x3d am5 cpu
always use 2 separate cable there literally reason
gpu doesnt support 12v2x6 cable

hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
got 9700x rest build cant find video card save life right looking 4070 super something close around 600 good holdover card play something like fortnite 1440p reasonable framerate wait something become available

likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup

part yeah part distinct piece puzzle fit work take old part motherboard put new motherboard profit real concern storage window install window gotten pretty good detecting new hardware like new motherboard configuring existing install perfect back data continuing case process go bad reformat reinstall o may also run window activation issue youre oem license since thats tied old motherboard ive luck calling microsoft telling youve swapped motherboards due old one dying theyll hook code fix install activated microsoft accountlinked key fix sign back
used 3070
anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough
400w sure 300 way close computer power usage
id argue would want wiggle room future expandability id also argue going small enough mandate flexatx unit difficult build occasional lan party might need go small look option like coolermaster nr200p deepcool ch160 fractal design terra take cheaper flexible sfx psus case might backpackable definitely fit duffel bag alongside peripheral ask know
gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna

lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user

anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality

im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause
theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090
paying 25 27 performance improvement doesnt feel like generational advancement quite disappointing

waiting 5070 5080 review decide upgrade 3080 get ps5
game 2k upgraded processor 9800x3d 3080 ti thinking grabbing 5080 reasonable upgrade wait see 5080 ti come
review went live today im confused sale 30th right
5090 actually good 5080 uhhhh 16gb still

5080 review
sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying
running 5090 pcie3x16 pcie4x16 would add video review list hardware canuck rtx 5090 cpu bottleneck pcie scaling benchmark morehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5tjkp2a0iw specifically test running card pcie3x16 pcie4x16 stated reason people using riser cable case installation limited speed pcie4x16 test great interest people current system gpu slot pcie4x16 wont attempt summarize tested lot different combination varying result conclusion feasible run pcie4x16 without losing much im also interested happens run pcie5x8 using pcie5 lane m2 card content creation wasnt tested im fully aware pcie5x8 overall bandwidth pcie4x16 5x8 fine bandwidth point view since pcie5 reduced latency pcie4 would think 5x8 might better certainly worse 4x16 wont know sure unanticipated effect going 5x8 someone test
im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090

yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come

yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus
deleted
well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote
part work 3d animation render gpus hence relevant u none term used particularly obscure happy help something isnt clear

yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

ive looked video showing performance gain versus insane power draw increase 90 imma wist till 6000s definite
fuck source basically non existent launch true even bot left disappointed
got tip best ive always bought second hand
month sound like lot difficulty
remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid
even 580s sli era 500 2 2010 voodoo tnt pre 2000 iirc sub 300 card dropped lower tier card much cheaper tv tuner version expensive always wanted one lol

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
possibly wouldnt pay kind money used gpu warranty history melting connector
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

problem 5080 looking 200 4080 super canada
want good advertised sold 23 frame manufactured looking good hope wrong
ill sell mine
going want 5090 cant afford
update 4090
1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
sure a6000 48gb 7300
coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation
ps5 pro frame generation insertion seen aidriven technology extend strictly upscaling project amethyst discussed fg amd backing high end gpu segment said moving focus back mainstream market place amd hope maintaining decent earnings issue plagued current generation top end offering misunderstand concern around machine learning ai im worried happening supplanting traditional rendering method im worried people going see gain 5090 4090 assume lower tiered card going similar raster rt gain likely nvidia pushed review 5080 far possiblelet 5090 review drop early 5070ti isnt even thing right want mindset cemented average buyer blackwell big jump ada well evidence contrary start appearing hell think dlss fsr4 finally get gamechanging technology come supplementing raw compute required traditional rendering method 6 year ago garbage 20series poorly received rt seen gimmick top poor priceperf improvement

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month
midlate ampere thing lovelace went right back early ampere add cartout stock
bestbuy doesnt offer waitlist notify come stock nothing pleasant email come already botted

feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming

fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin

wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less

theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090
paying 25 27 performance improvement doesnt feel like generational advancement quite disappointing

3080 12gb currently vram boost 5080 impressive streamer im wondering whether mfg gon na help leaving headroom encoders thing whilst gaming big question 5080 gon na outperform 4090 spec wise dont think im gon na leaning raw performance seriously hooked marvel rival 240hz oled 4090 drop enough value make price performance appealing 5080hmmm decision

sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying

im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090

thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come

yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus

well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch
""
scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote
part work 3d animation render gpus hence relevant u none term used particularly obscure happy help something isnt clear
mean knew going yikes saw 575w tdp didnt think itd actually hit 500w consistently though im surprised people dont take issue
yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
possibly wouldnt pay kind money used gpu warranty history melting connector
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
sure a6000 48gb 7300
coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation
ps5 pro frame generation insertion seen aidriven technology extend strictly upscaling project amethyst discussed fg amd backing high end gpu segment said moving focus back mainstream market place amd hope maintaining decent earnings issue plagued current generation top end offering misunderstand concern around machine learning ai im worried happening supplanting traditional rendering method im worried people going see gain 5090 4090 assume lower tiered card going similar raster rt gain likely nvidia pushed review 5080 far possiblelet 5090 review drop early 5070ti isnt even thing right want mindset cemented average buyer blackwell big jump ada well evidence contrary start appearing hell think dlss fsr4 finally get gamechanging technology come supplementing raw compute required traditional rendering method 6 year ago garbage 20series poorly received rt seen gimmick top poor priceperf improvement

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well

people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement

miss evga best havent personally heard direct sale notification queue im sure anyone intel wed like know im signed whatever get feel like im mostly going bet farm snagging launch minute pick notification never helped back 30 series fiasco
commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin
im restrospect shouldve shelled little bit 4090 cest la vie got enjoy powerful card rarely found wanting almost 3 year
genuinely relevant career youre making enough get ai workstation better yet private rack somewhere way prolevel card two thats stretch dont really need learn ai career there really lot edge case dont fall one two group
im nerd want im sure much use something like 5090 diy ai vast majority model likely going train run fine whatever right truly big boy stuff wont anything less data center small window want run train something big easier rent resource plus youd unable use machine anything else daysweeks
look like 3090 founder going 750900ish kinda range ebay moment id probably look local buyer kinda range though friend who 2070 super melted recently he making due brother old 1080 ti favor like watch dog free sometimes ill probably offer friend discount first especially since paid 500

1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing

used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor

1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p

getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful

im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate

wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp

im waiting pg27ucdm 4k oled 27 inch monitor ive playing 24 inch 1080p screen although could desk space 32 dont think im ready jump yet
depends viewing distance 27 inch 4k complete waste sit 3 screen sit 2 foot screen going need excellent eyesight tell difference sit 12 away definitely tell
waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better

almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah
deleted
one sir
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
length arm
op specifically mentiones point whole upgrade gaming would recommend something general use work never asked

nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
there thing future proof either help

congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss

last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked

solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios

put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even

indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine

sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
buy better psu
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
put way psu doesnt 0 rpm mode case 7 fan sat desk sit recording vocal mixing music dont notice picked recording good psu doesnt need 0 rpm already near silent sound like buddy bad noisy one youve tuned fan quiet moving enough air psu getting hot revving cool try raising rpm case fan little psu slows find happy medium isnt one probably noisy psu
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
see lot people saying 0rpm doesnt matter youre gaming headphone thats point 0rpm mode youre gaming psu going running fan regardless pc idling im task doesnt require headphone dont want distracted psu fan going crazy
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
yes reduces price
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
hope company never stop release psus gpus without 0rpm mode want fan last longer wear faster constant startstop bullshit pain as replace
super flower leadex vii 1300w zero rpm feature toggled onoff switch
company still sell cheaper psus lower quality part would great without airflow yes cut cost hopefully saving passed consumer another way saying buying expensive isnt buying quality overpriced crap
cant even hear psu fan running small amount airflow increase reliability
love loud fan pc way know working
simple answer people buy
even pretty cheap psu probably doesnt go 0 rpm basically silent im playing game dont see huge reason
feel need make sure hear computer something wrong little bit fan noise bad annoying
replaced 16 year old ultra x3 psu died one cheaper quiet psus doesnt 0rpm mode kneel beside cant tell apart cpu case fan
mine silent mode dont bother using time hear pc fan get going anyway rog thor 1000w iirc want know
ive turned every evga power supply ive owned annoying hear fan suddenly ramp settle second unit temp threshold cycle
certainly dont care dont use pc without headphone anyways
see lot tinnitus candidate thread good guy constant weeeeeeeeee hear keep company grow older
silent say 7 noctua 3000 rpm fan case controlled fan expert dont care noise play headset anyway
im worried psu lasting long
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
yeah noise something worry especially since either something playing tv phone wear headphone becomes background noise bit anyways
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
play game watch video
fair opinion feel like people dont see way
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
exactly people talking like headphone solution everything well everyone us headphone watch hd movie surround sound system mine wife watch loud distracting noise coming computer would take u movie ruin experience
ok know say common experience fan kick power supply pull watt start heat say oversized 1200watt platinum evga power supply doesnt start fun even game full load system marginally get 600watt bought psu need different current set utilised benefit never kicking fan
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
installed corsair rm850x shift year ago ive never heard even run passively 30 40 load spin quietly havent heard yet buy quality model cheaper one
also fan constantly running gather much dust
doesnt affect something must wrong classic response ive hearing pc community decade
impossible still get pretty quiet overspend cooling accept performance penalty recent build 4070ti r9 7900 people would say completely inaudible even full gaming load
like dog people leave tv radio
like confidently wrong power supply eco mode fact looking 3 pc right eco mode fan turn psu hot enough require fan spin big enough psu get fan never spin never asked enough power heat sufficiently kick fan yes know might impact efficient sweet spot psu matter power consumption airflow always required system dissipating enough heat ksit natural convection threadripper system 3080 evga platinum 1200watt psu even gaming load doesnt kick fan doesnt even reach 50 psu rating load
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
game pc reliably isnt max length hdmi cable
pc produce little noise regular operation could easily made even quieter wished aio run needlessly high idle fan speed counter ramping noise fan make major temp fluctuation wanted could make pc even quieter due boosting behaviour 7800x3d fan actually loudest ramping higher speed chip may boost beyond 70c couple second even mundane task setting low fan speed light work would still cause random spike noise leaving reasonably low level prevents excess noise could make seperate fan curve use really needed pc quieter simply choose
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
could often tell tv turned different room apparently one knew could hear
love confidently replied actually reading wrote never said fan wouldnt spin said active component generate heat heat might passively dissipated low power consumption 0 rpm said psu start heat start spin fan guess youve never heard pc silent winter cold room become rb211 hot day load
say
could run ac unit keep room cold like server room
optical hdmi cable go even 300 foot
active cable thunderbolt depends far away put use regular cable side wall linuss current method us usb fiber box probably good option ive used thunderbolt 3 great work big pain doesnt recently converted main pc vm host thunderbolt didnt want play nice plenty option usb display cable huge length
young hear wouldnt call screeching though white noise
im obsessed oc low temp couple year aggressuve fan curve started drive mad let component reach high 60 case feel like theyre kinda hot people daily running 80c friend mine using 1050ti 90c around 10h per day rendering gaming lasted 6 year guess got ta stop obsessed also tend overshare fucking lot coul tell lmao
hit belt
cant hear anymore either got ta grow someday
im rocking asrock b650e steel legend complaint
go pcpartpicker com use make sure everything compatible motherboards specifically lookup review board youre interested tend good advice like hardware unboxed motherboard review
x870 tomahawk lane sharing plain simple
b650 b650e fine
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax 9800x3d 64 gig cl30 ram fantastic b650 board would work fine cost way less
m2 ssds pcie 40 50
money objection x870e taichi otherwise b850 livemixer b650 gaming plus
4080s 9800x3d cant afford high end motherboard x670e x870e lane
gigabyte x870 gaming wifi6 wifi7 pcie gen 5 m2 slot gen 5 x16 slot gpu good bluetooth wifi great io built 2 build friend 9800x3d work like charm edit 3 ssds dont notice performance dip dont know much lane issue
went asrock x870e nova avoid lane sharing also generally well regarded
im wrong x670e tomahawk shouldnt lane sharing issue regarded fairly decent motherboard asrock b650e riptide
asus rog crosshair x670e gene
cpugpu think ram causing issue here build httpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vfhttpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vf
asrock released b850 line picked riptide delivery today
get decent looking mid range board dont need anything crazy b650 chipset probably fine
asrock x870 riptide lane sharing us killer lan doesnt realtek lan issue reported x870 board decent price little expensive budget board going break bank either also support 9800x3d straight box bios flashback needed
went asrock x870 riptide good hardware unboxed made video x870 board
am5 board right im mistaken upgrade path leading 9800x3d pretty long asrock b650 pg lightning work
b650ee issue far
gigabyte 850 ai top
get cheapest b650 motherboard 3 m2 port thats like asrock b650m pro r something 5090 loses 1 going pcie 5 x16 pcie 4 x16 1 enabling ray tracing exact performance 2 pcie generation unless move thousand terabyte daily ssds pcie 3 4 5 wont ever see feel difference dont complicate thing dont spend hype marketing
b850 pro r wifi pretty much perfect board
im using asrock taichi lite x870e
right ended going b850 steel legend there excel sheet somewhere around reddit updated mobos spec kinda helpful helping pick one
avoid asus would go asrock right value feature
avoid gigabyte lineup shared pcie lane think x870 tomahawk doesnt share gpu pcie lane m2 slot used search msi website find specific model interested look manual reference
doesnt cpu decide many lane
asus b650ee fine setup despite people say 4080 super run full pcle 40 x16 speed youll enough lane m2 drive make sure put fastest ssd top slot want absolutely sure extra cash x670e board offer pcle 50 lane probably overkill people
ive got asrock b650 none steel legend complaint either yes ive got pcie 5 support gpu ssd 1
put 3 m2 ssds problem without cutting speed
good choice mobo good hard find stock
ive seen people suggesting avoid gigabyte asus motherboards whats issue curiosity
dont worry dont need use ssd slot
motherboard manufacturer chooses lane wired pcie 5 board wanted pcie 5 m2 slot one slot share lane gpu slot lane gpu get 16 lane unless certain m2 filled case get 8 lane 8 used m2 instead board gpu mean top pcie slot doesnt share lane anything else board manufacturer also chooses lane come cpu chipset except top pcie slot always use cpu lane since thats defacto gpu slot
u cant m22 cut usb 40 gig port half disable want full speed m2 m23 take pcie slot expansion slot equipped m24 isnt pcie 5
problem
people hugely overrestimate big difference lane sharing make mostly game pcie 5 board difference x16 x8 lane 01 matter storage go
true newegg seems getting constant stock recently got mine need get app tell stock jump oni
asus think rma everything honor duty fix problem
people say avoid gigabyte
sorry didnt mean say gigabyte lol sorry typed way fast
nice know im america already running steel legend
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
ressell really good cpu
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache
would say keep new processor upgrade mobo ram especially since likely upgrade sometime road anyways point youd getting cpu mobo ram new processor better plus youll getting better ram youll see difference sure later would upgrading cpu anyways focus solely cpu maybe gou point youll 2 upgrade already way thing would really highly recommend mobo make sure memory clock speed high enough enable expo mobos ive seen support like 4500mhz ram also make sure mobo good vrm 8500g 65 watt cpu problem finding anything handle mainly later get new cpu say got mobo right vrm handle 105 watt cpu want put 120 watt cpu need upgrade mobo worth extra buck make sure mobo good enough future upgrade
deleted
pretty sure ops post mention 8500g 5600 non x arguing want make sure youre comparing correct product change much op considering going am5 anyway would cheap way always get actual cpu upgrade later
personal opinion dataset back claim 8600g newer architecture improved single multithreaded performance integrated graphic 760m isnt something sneeze everyday light 1080p perfect personally use 5600g htpc id upgrade 8600geventually higher clock speed pcie 50 support 5600x lower price 50 cheaper neck wood larger l3 cache thing op would need ram mobo go budget itll cost much am5 am4and advantage able upgrade path future
passmark 8500g slightly faster single corehttpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare4811vs5841amdryzen55600vsamdryzen58500g come wash gaming got lighter cache wouldnt completely replatform accommodate op want move smaller system used b550ib550m board would play sell 8500g fund swap
way sold cpu many people message wild posted 10 buck cheaper others gone instantly got free list decent price someone take super fast upgraded 5800x3dwas order 5700x3d 219 found 5800x3d 250 locally used amazing doubled fps tarkov absolutely love massive massive upgrade good probably skip am5 im giving kid year building itx 9800x3d5080 build son hasnt begging pc he good fucking kid truly deserves would completely skip am5
client wanted probably
received wrong package amazon told keep free
yeah sell nib 8600g throw money much faster anything simply doesnt make sense selling point igpu doesnt need
pcie 50 support 8000g processor pcie 40 support 8 lane top pcie slot 8500g 4 lane even limited hybrid zen 4c design
deleted
straight game numbersyes isnt op spend time sell 8600g know someone buy far easier likely he going sell online present whole number issue annoyance telling op build new pc dead platform 5600x upgrade path dumb
read ordered mac motherboard received cpu didnt order cpu
never said build anything said worth building whole new rig around 8600g discernable improvement worth time hassle side grade
op isnt building pc dead platform read anything said am4 build super easy sell cpu posted mine fb week ago 50 people message woke thr guy bought messaged legit less 5 min posted esp decent deal free post cheaper use money get 5700x3d gaming 5900x whatever budget building entire new am5 build working am4 build low end cpu stupid lol using money 5700x3d 5900x even 5950x used would way better upgrade
am5 little reason use ddr56000 cl30 memory yes 7500f enough general gaming relative budget
ive managed i52500k since 2013 upgraded ssd gtx 1060 3gb ram guess id manage 7500f better go corsair vengeance ddr5 6000 mhz 32 gt cl40 80 used wondering future proofing would sense make go powerful cpu see ill manage get new one 5 year
future proofing spending spend even later unless getting x3d cpu isnt much advantage better am5 cpu unless want core even gaming performance isnt much different simply put want ddr56000 cl30 possible cl40 wont lose much performance though
experience ddr5 4800 mhz finicky term motherboard compatibility return 6000 mhz kit bought common respected brand buy 4800 mhz kit found manufacturer compatibility list wouldnt really sweat difference much
6700 xt 6750 xt find one either 7600 xt b580
b580 competition find one msrp
intel arc b580 competition ups budget get awesome card
6750xt 6700xt b580 7600xt order best best haha
planning using
stretch bit rx 6750 xt 360390 euro best youll get price range
3080 ebay
cant find b580 retail b570 also seems perform really well think change drastic doesnt really matter get
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
6000 cl30 ddr5
sell 8 gb stick put two 16 gb stick
sell memory buy pair best way possible dual mode may deactivated timing set safe slow work rare case wont start
guarantee run 3200 bought another stick 3200 mixing memory always increase chance doesnt work expected would run flex mode would 8gb8gb running dual channel remaining 8gb would run single channel 16gb memory needed imo unless need capacity likely going result situation
recommendation new 2x16 set replace get new 2x16 3200 ddr4 set 50 unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably dont use timing case way either motherboard try figure youre customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip youd make sure pretty thorough stability test
gpu might worth trying boot integrated graphic assume boot drive showing bios
reset bios unplugging psu either shorting cmos pin 10 second hitting button motherboard second removing cmos battery 30 second
tried fresh install window get another boot drive test existing boot drive rule corrupt o
long let attempt boot window cpuramboot led debug light lighting memory training am5 take first boot talking minute ten minute
possible something happened boot expo file corrupted try boot install medium see reset way
yes boot drive showing bios actually already dont gpu pc yet im going try 50 series day assembled rest pc yesterday make sure everything working
unfortunately ive done 10 time bring bios reset default setting trying boot still hang black screen
dont think window issue booted window fine yesterday used pc little enabling expo get back
let run 20 minute instance earlier attempt yellow light come resetting cmos reinstalling ram made go away
look restore memory context thing change auto enabled fresh window install may worth seeing cant boot usb install medium reinstall also update bios possible thing would try
even without enabling expo made sure trying boot base 4800mts ram speed
id check boot sequence see stage boot process get past always accurate help point fails boot im sure yellow light mean particular motherboard sound strange booting anymore even resetting cmos back default
yes fresh window install also updated bios yesterday beforehand im already latest version restoring memory context
yes ive hit disable expo bios well manually chosen 4800mt clock speed way boot anymore
httpswwwredditcomramdsdzoxrivizi look thread found see may possibly help pretty old would thought updated bios would rule hey never know uh yea would personally try see even boot usb window install medium least troubleshooting reinstalling window could fix issue would eliminate headache
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
yes window drive first boot order actually able boot window use computer earlier since enabling expo everything got messed debug led none
see youve tried either stick time tried slot worst thing think possibly hardware issue either cpu fully socketed one ram channel dead even ram issue
used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly
aib model 5090s avoid whatever reason pay asus tax
got sparkle intel arc a310 eco tforce vulcan 25 inch ssd know powerful stuff play league legend pc want 144fps stuff get know pci 4 slot card resizable bar needed
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax v2 decent enough motherboard ryzen 5 7600x 64gb ram
im thinking getting new pc upgrading current one something ive never done spec need find current pc share see would better video card one know sure need radeon rx 580
want bench test cpu motherboard ram make sure component work wait gpu without installing cpu cooler im going sff cooler block ram would repaste cpu replace ram end issue ram
hey live israel gpu market kinda expensive rtx 4070 ti super go like 1165 store sapphire rx 7600 xt 16gb go 455 asrock amd radeon rx 6700 xt challenger pro 12gb oc much would guy pay gpu second hand get around 200250 good deal considering price listed
5080 review start coming
thing dustproof build build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible
game dev would recommend going amd card higher vram nvidia card lower vram nvidia card really expensive tough choice
hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
got 9700x rest build cant find video card save life right looking 4070 super something close around 600 good holdover card play something like fortnite 1440p reasonable framerate wait something become available
im currently running 5600 rx6600 650w psu full tower case going lan party pain im thinking swapping itx case thats backpack size concern psu according pcpartpicker rig consume around 260w go 300w 400w flex psu
would better get 750w psu 12vhpwr connector 1000w psu without one im probably going get 4070 super 5070
im new pc building build found sub im interested 7600 rx7800xt cost 1000 question much downgrade bit choose like cheaper gpu still able easily play modern game smoothly keep saving make build build httpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42klhttpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42kl sorry dumb question
likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup
embargo lifted launch day thursday
thing dustproof build make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect
thing dustproof build best get case easy remove toolless panel tray filter pop run fawcet leave dry pop right back often couple week youll avoid worst still get layer dust inside eventually component fan blade frame youll clean recommend looking fractal design case since usually nice filter decent brand nowadays offer
amd gpu decent game development rgamedevhttpswwwredditcomrgamedevcomments15auicgisanamdgpudecentforgamedevelopment here helpful thread provide good insight
part yeah part distinct piece puzzle fit work take old part motherboard put new motherboard profit real concern storage window install window gotten pretty good detecting new hardware like new motherboard configuring existing install perfect back data continuing case process go bad reformat reinstall o may also run window activation issue youre oem license since thats tied old motherboard ive luck calling microsoft telling youve swapped motherboards due old one dying theyll hook code fix install activated microsoft accountlinked key fix sign back
used 3070
anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough
400w sure 300 way close computer power usage
id argue would want wiggle room future expandability id also argue going small enough mandate flexatx unit difficult build occasional lan party might need go small look option like coolermaster nr200p deepcool ch160 fractal design terra take cheaper flexible sfx psus case might backpackable definitely fit duffel bag alongside peripheral ask know
gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan
thanks friendo hoping hear assumed would work puzzle wanted make sure wouldnt shenanigan m2 popped new mobo mainly keep concern mind booting hope dont reformat reinstall end day really steam game biggie
4060 290 perhaps

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna

lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user
would liked seen review 5080 im sure hell paying 5090 5080 would consider
anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality
optimistic 5070ti card going look like without 4x fake frame cheesing
5080 benchmark yet
im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause
theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090
paying 25 27 performance improvement doesnt feel like generational advancement quite disappointing

sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying
running 5090 pcie3x16 pcie4x16 would add video review list hardware canuck rtx 5090 cpu bottleneck pcie scaling benchmark morehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5tjkp2a0iw specifically test running card pcie3x16 pcie4x16 stated reason people using riser cable case installation limited speed pcie4x16 test great interest people current system gpu slot pcie4x16 wont attempt summarize tested lot different combination varying result conclusion feasible run pcie4x16 without losing much im also interested happens run pcie5x8 using pcie5 lane m2 card content creation wasnt tested im fully aware pcie5x8 overall bandwidth pcie4x16 5x8 fine bandwidth point view since pcie5 reduced latency pcie4 would think 5x8 might better certainly worse 4x16 wont know sure unanticipated effect going 5x8 someone test
im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090
want put 2070 pasture badly 5080 5090 look like nvidia funneling 5080 supertibothwhatever

extra 100w power draw time performance giving intel vibe pump wattage chip point theyll step back focus efficiency unless also want u market install 240v line pc
good cooling system probably need wit scaling watt usage match
noiiice
nvidia successfully got consumer stating 2k founder edition flagship card rip
cooling might impressive context insane amount heat able deal end day solve problem card caused temp still higher noise higher remarkable good still worse cooling dealing almost 600watts mention heating getting dumpe case heat component room cooling thing isnt selling point
5090 lot faster potential 4090 ti
almost like pure rasterization power plateauing way keep pumping performance pump power consumption price
post rnvidia youll get well ackshually even though spirit correct modest jump huge jump price power consumption exactly youd expect 4090ti redesigned core feature arent important performance power consumption make seem like mid gen refresh

5090 isnt gaming card ai tinkering card

seems pretty much inline difference core count two card
dude 4k good test card even best cpu difference increase 8k
came someone watching closely title made think 5080 content see
upvotes
yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come
deleted
yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus

well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time

vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation

nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area

27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful
got 27 5k imac 2019 enjoyed every moment waste
ran 4k awhile loved 4070ti handled perfectly
unsure one looking know people judge saying asus got good deal 4k 144hz ip monitor bought one 560
im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate
would gimp experience reason nvidia blackwell gpu render everypixelanew 1440p60 render 4k240 framegen upscaling welcome 2025
240hz waste money
wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp
got 4k 48inch tv mainly watching shit game well shit nice couldnt pas black friday sale
whole sweet spot thing bang buck availability people point dont 4k 1440p monitor compribale size cant side side comparison ops budget allows get gpu push performance full send budget limited got 1440p 27 think look great however 17 4k panel editing laptop ill tell look amazing infinitly crispier desktop monitor pixel density noticeable side side
level scaling use
im waiting pg27ucdm 4k oled 27 inch monitor ive playing 24 inch 1080p screen although could desk space 32 dont think im ready jump yet
depends viewing distance 27 inch 4k complete waste sit 3 screen sit 2 foot screen going need excellent eyesight tell difference sit 12 away definitely tell
waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better
anything past 140ppi honestly pointless 27 smallest go 4k resolution 32 perfect size
samesies
upvoted comment personally cant imagine would comfortable sit close enough monitor 4k matter 27 screen someone may fine refer chart httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance
bet response time refresh rate bigger uplift dont blame titan x came 2015 gamed 4k tv barely 2845 fps sli setup waiting 5 generation upgrade good call part
almost ppi 24 1080p considered lowend sweet spot
sweet spot budget build build 5 series
okay mr fancy pant 32 foot 1440p
must beefy benq projector prop dude lol
nope there single game play us upscaling tv broadcasting
hdr400 isnt low
reason chose dwf dw understanding dw gsync compatible would suited nvidia gpu
4k 120144hz common within reasonable price range considering buyer already buying 5080
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
interesting point regret refresh rate
went 4k felt like wasting 4070 ti super 1080 gaming wow certainly night day every screen life look like cheap toy
he getting 5080
jump pixel density often higher 1440p 4k 1080p 1440p look popular screen size respective ppi lot time see people go small 1080p screen big 1440p screen actually lose pixel density
1 1080p 2k 1440p 25k 2 25k 78 pixel 2k 100 3 4k 225 time pixel 25k roughly 4 time 2k
golden rule pixel density phone tablet much higher 27 4k youre fine actually enjoy
swear oled screen making blinder everyday
many people like work mainly play factorio demanding game play moment maybe elite icarus
4k relevant resolution game feel like game would perfectly fine 1440p240hz well
one buy 5080 play doom want play newer game
smooth cursor get enough love opening menu window glorious 240hz
old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
tv care far away sitting desk youre going sitting spot regardless monitor get going big possibly handle seems like dumb advice course reddit could never
almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah
deleted
one sir
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
length arm
op specifically mentiones point whole upgrade gaming would recommend something general use work never asked

nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade
would happily trade freedom unit 556 55 grain ball dispersed indiscriminately occupying force made adhd 19 year old american didnt get college natural resource

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
there thing future proof either help
2 day ago gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet
went 3600x stock wraith spire cooler 5800x3d tried using wraith 5800x3d load thermal throttled recommend
age many people refuse even admit made mistake salute honest idiot
last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked
recently dealt gpu performance issue year finally figured slightly dislodged move receiving x1 pcie lane

ive seen worse could one story sat cpu bending every single pin
somewhat offtopic anyone know deepcool ak400 suffice cooling 5700x3d
lol exact thing 3 week ago
well least discovered new form thermal insulation honestly plasticcooled new category weve man prop sharing
always baffle many people talk missing dont get clearly visible coming someone forgets io shield time bent pin cpu first pc built
missed decade
make feel better despite knowing full well parent aio 2008 technically didnt meet requirement window 11 spent whole day trying shoehorn anyways knew possible get around requirement done try toil trying different method prepare install medium happened upon obscure bit information newest win 11 build dropped sse41 requires sse42 unfortunately t5850 core dual doesnt supportunderstand sse42 instruction physically impossible run win 11 core dual system thorough clean repaste throwing cheap ssd perfectly usable win 10
solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

yeah plastic covershttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcsearchqplasticcoverrestrictsronsortrelevancetall bane first time builder
feel seen
future resistant haha
im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case
appreciate
ohhhh
ive definitely done
crazy often stuff work barely really shouldnt
oooof
like said surprisingly effective
missed saw accepted responsibility forgot
clearly day

10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even

indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine
7600x3d xfx magnetic air 7900xtx hell combo im 4k
used
8gbs vram use since cant run game 60 fps natively 4k already
care much vram people care actual gaming performance much vram card
nope httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewgputestsystemupdatefor20252html
4k 10 fall 1440p 1080p 5 less
11 month ago game selection matter
""
run wow ultra
imo like designed 92
he running 1440p
12 game average one basically guaranteed cod here exhaustive comparison result httpswwwtechpowerupcomgpuspecsgeforcertx4080superc4182httpswwwtechpowerupcomgpuspecsgeforcertx4080superc4182
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
buy better psu
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
put way psu doesnt 0 rpm mode case 7 fan sat desk sit recording vocal mixing music dont notice picked recording good psu doesnt need 0 rpm already near silent sound like buddy bad noisy one youve tuned fan quiet moving enough air psu getting hot revving cool try raising rpm case fan little psu slows find happy medium isnt one probably noisy psu
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
see lot people saying 0rpm doesnt matter youre gaming headphone thats point 0rpm mode youre gaming psu going running fan regardless pc idling im task doesnt require headphone dont want distracted psu fan going crazy
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
yes reduces price
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
hope company never stop release psus gpus without 0rpm mode want fan last longer wear faster constant startstop bullshit pain as replace
super flower leadex vii 1300w zero rpm feature toggled onoff switch
company still sell cheaper psus lower quality part would great without airflow yes cut cost hopefully saving passed consumer another way saying buying expensive isnt buying quality overpriced crap
cant even hear psu fan running small amount airflow increase reliability
love loud fan pc way know working
simple answer people buy
even pretty cheap psu probably doesnt go 0 rpm basically silent im playing game dont see huge reason
feel need make sure hear computer something wrong little bit fan noise bad annoying
replaced 16 year old ultra x3 psu died one cheaper quiet psus doesnt 0rpm mode kneel beside cant tell apart cpu case fan
mine silent mode dont bother using time hear pc fan get going anyway rog thor 1000w iirc want know
ive turned every evga power supply ive owned annoying hear fan suddenly ramp settle second unit temp threshold cycle
certainly dont care dont use pc without headphone anyways
see lot tinnitus candidate thread good guy constant weeeeeeeeee hear keep company grow older
silent say 7 noctua 3000 rpm fan case controlled fan expert dont care noise play headset anyway
im worried psu lasting long
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
yeah noise something worry especially since either something playing tv phone wear headphone becomes background noise bit anyways
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
play game watch video
fair opinion feel like people dont see way
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
exactly people talking like headphone solution everything well everyone us headphone watch hd movie surround sound system mine wife watch loud distracting noise coming computer would take u movie ruin experience
ok know say common experience fan kick power supply pull watt start heat say oversized 1200watt platinum evga power supply doesnt start fun even game full load system marginally get 600watt bought psu need different current set utilised benefit never kicking fan
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
installed corsair rm850x shift year ago ive never heard even run passively 30 40 load spin quietly havent heard yet buy quality model cheaper one
also fan constantly running gather much dust
doesnt affect something must wrong classic response ive hearing pc community decade
impossible still get pretty quiet overspend cooling accept performance penalty recent build 4070ti r9 7900 people would say completely inaudible even full gaming load
like dog people leave tv radio
like confidently wrong power supply eco mode fact looking 3 pc right eco mode fan turn psu hot enough require fan spin big enough psu get fan never spin never asked enough power heat sufficiently kick fan yes know might impact efficient sweet spot psu matter power consumption airflow always required system dissipating enough heat ksit natural convection threadripper system 3080 evga platinum 1200watt psu even gaming load doesnt kick fan doesnt even reach 50 psu rating load
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
game pc reliably isnt max length hdmi cable
pc produce little noise regular operation could easily made even quieter wished aio run needlessly high idle fan speed counter ramping noise fan make major temp fluctuation wanted could make pc even quieter due boosting behaviour 7800x3d fan actually loudest ramping higher speed chip may boost beyond 70c couple second even mundane task setting low fan speed light work would still cause random spike noise leaving reasonably low level prevents excess noise could make seperate fan curve use really needed pc quieter simply choose
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
could often tell tv turned different room apparently one knew could hear
love confidently replied actually reading wrote never said fan wouldnt spin said active component generate heat heat might passively dissipated low power consumption 0 rpm said psu start heat start spin fan guess youve never heard pc silent winter cold room become rb211 hot day load
say
could run ac unit keep room cold like server room
optical hdmi cable go even 300 foot
active cable thunderbolt depends far away put use regular cable side wall linuss current method us usb fiber box probably good option ive used thunderbolt 3 great work big pain doesnt recently converted main pc vm host thunderbolt didnt want play nice plenty option usb display cable huge length
young hear wouldnt call screeching though white noise
im obsessed oc low temp couple year aggressuve fan curve started drive mad let component reach high 60 case feel like theyre kinda hot people daily running 80c friend mine using 1050ti 90c around 10h per day rendering gaming lasted 6 year guess got ta stop obsessed also tend overshare fucking lot coul tell lmao
hit belt
cant hear anymore either got ta grow someday
im rocking asrock b650e steel legend complaint
go pcpartpicker com use make sure everything compatible motherboards specifically lookup review board youre interested tend good advice like hardware unboxed motherboard review
x870 tomahawk lane sharing plain simple
b650 b650e fine
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax 9800x3d 64 gig cl30 ram fantastic b650 board would work fine cost way less
m2 ssds pcie 40 50
money objection x870e taichi otherwise b850 livemixer b650 gaming plus
4080s 9800x3d cant afford high end motherboard x670e x870e lane
gigabyte x870 gaming wifi6 wifi7 pcie gen 5 m2 slot gen 5 x16 slot gpu good bluetooth wifi great io built 2 build friend 9800x3d work like charm edit 3 ssds dont notice performance dip dont know much lane issue
went asrock x870e nova avoid lane sharing also generally well regarded
im wrong x670e tomahawk shouldnt lane sharing issue regarded fairly decent motherboard asrock b650e riptide
asus rog crosshair x670e gene
cpugpu think ram causing issue here build httpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vfhttpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vf
asrock released b850 line picked riptide delivery today
get decent looking mid range board dont need anything crazy b650 chipset probably fine
asrock x870 riptide lane sharing us killer lan doesnt realtek lan issue reported x870 board decent price little expensive budget board going break bank either also support 9800x3d straight box bios flashback needed
went asrock x870 riptide good hardware unboxed made video x870 board
am5 board right im mistaken upgrade path leading 9800x3d pretty long asrock b650 pg lightning work
b650ee issue far
gigabyte 850 ai top
get cheapest b650 motherboard 3 m2 port thats like asrock b650m pro r something 5090 loses 1 going pcie 5 x16 pcie 4 x16 1 enabling ray tracing exact performance 2 pcie generation unless move thousand terabyte daily ssds pcie 3 4 5 wont ever see feel difference dont complicate thing dont spend hype marketing
b850 pro r wifi pretty much perfect board
im using asrock taichi lite x870e
right ended going b850 steel legend there excel sheet somewhere around reddit updated mobos spec kinda helpful helping pick one
avoid asus would go asrock right value feature
avoid gigabyte lineup shared pcie lane think x870 tomahawk doesnt share gpu pcie lane m2 slot used search msi website find specific model interested look manual reference
doesnt cpu decide many lane
asus b650ee fine setup despite people say 4080 super run full pcle 40 x16 speed youll enough lane m2 drive make sure put fastest ssd top slot want absolutely sure extra cash x670e board offer pcle 50 lane probably overkill people
ive got asrock b650 none steel legend complaint either yes ive got pcie 5 support gpu ssd 1
put 3 m2 ssds problem without cutting speed
good choice mobo good hard find stock
ive seen people suggesting avoid gigabyte asus motherboards whats issue curiosity
dont worry dont need use ssd slot
motherboard manufacturer chooses lane wired pcie 5 board wanted pcie 5 m2 slot one slot share lane gpu slot lane gpu get 16 lane unless certain m2 filled case get 8 lane 8 used m2 instead board gpu mean top pcie slot doesnt share lane anything else board manufacturer also chooses lane come cpu chipset except top pcie slot always use cpu lane since thats defacto gpu slot
u cant m22 cut usb 40 gig port half disable want full speed m2 m23 take pcie slot expansion slot equipped m24 isnt pcie 5
problem
people hugely overrestimate big difference lane sharing make mostly game pcie 5 board difference x16 x8 lane 01 matter storage go
true newegg seems getting constant stock recently got mine need get app tell stock jump oni
asus think rma everything honor duty fix problem
people say avoid gigabyte
sorry didnt mean say gigabyte lol sorry typed way fast
nice know im america already running steel legend
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
ressell really good cpu
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache
would say keep new processor upgrade mobo ram especially since likely upgrade sometime road anyways point youd getting cpu mobo ram new processor better plus youll getting better ram youll see difference sure later would upgrading cpu anyways focus solely cpu maybe gou point youll 2 upgrade already way thing would really highly recommend mobo make sure memory clock speed high enough enable expo mobos ive seen support like 4500mhz ram also make sure mobo good vrm 8500g 65 watt cpu problem finding anything handle mainly later get new cpu say got mobo right vrm handle 105 watt cpu want put 120 watt cpu need upgrade mobo worth extra buck make sure mobo good enough future upgrade
deleted
pretty sure ops post mention 8500g 5600 non x arguing want make sure youre comparing correct product change much op considering going am5 anyway would cheap way always get actual cpu upgrade later
personal opinion dataset back claim 8600g newer architecture improved single multithreaded performance integrated graphic 760m isnt something sneeze everyday light 1080p perfect personally use 5600g htpc id upgrade 8600geventually higher clock speed pcie 50 support 5600x lower price 50 cheaper neck wood larger l3 cache thing op would need ram mobo go budget itll cost much am5 am4and advantage able upgrade path future
passmark 8500g slightly faster single corehttpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare4811vs5841amdryzen55600vsamdryzen58500g come wash gaming got lighter cache wouldnt completely replatform accommodate op want move smaller system used b550ib550m board would play sell 8500g fund swap
way sold cpu many people message wild posted 10 buck cheaper others gone instantly got free list decent price someone take super fast upgraded 5800x3dwas order 5700x3d 219 found 5800x3d 250 locally used amazing doubled fps tarkov absolutely love massive massive upgrade good probably skip am5 im giving kid year building itx 9800x3d5080 build son hasnt begging pc he good fucking kid truly deserves would completely skip am5
client wanted probably
received wrong package amazon told keep free
yeah sell nib 8600g throw money much faster anything simply doesnt make sense selling point igpu doesnt need
pcie 50 support 8000g processor pcie 40 support 8 lane top pcie slot 8500g 4 lane even limited hybrid zen 4c design
deleted
straight game numbersyes isnt op spend time sell 8600g know someone buy far easier likely he going sell online present whole number issue annoyance telling op build new pc dead platform 5600x upgrade path dumb
read ordered mac motherboard received cpu didnt order cpu
never said build anything said worth building whole new rig around 8600g discernable improvement worth time hassle side grade
op isnt building pc dead platform read anything said am4 build super easy sell cpu posted mine fb week ago 50 people message woke thr guy bought messaged legit less 5 min posted esp decent deal free post cheaper use money get 5700x3d gaming 5900x whatever budget building entire new am5 build working am4 build low end cpu stupid lol using money 5700x3d 5900x even 5950x used would way better upgrade
am5 little reason use ddr56000 cl30 memory yes 7500f enough general gaming relative budget
ive managed i52500k since 2013 upgraded ssd gtx 1060 3gb ram guess id manage 7500f better go corsair vengeance ddr5 6000 mhz 32 gt cl40 80 used wondering future proofing would sense make go powerful cpu see ill manage get new one 5 year
future proofing spending spend even later unless getting x3d cpu isnt much advantage better am5 cpu unless want core even gaming performance isnt much different simply put want ddr56000 cl30 possible cl40 wont lose much performance though
experience ddr5 4800 mhz finicky term motherboard compatibility return 6000 mhz kit bought common respected brand buy 4800 mhz kit found manufacturer compatibility list wouldnt really sweat difference much
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
6000 cl30 ddr5
6700 xt 6750 xt find one either 7600 xt b580
b580 competition find one msrp
intel arc b580 competition ups budget get awesome card
6750xt 6700xt b580 7600xt order best best haha
planning using
stretch bit rx 6750 xt 360390 euro best youll get price range
3080 ebay
cant find b580 retail b570 also seems perform really well think change drastic doesnt really matter get
sell 8 gb stick put two 16 gb stick
sell memory buy pair best way possible dual mode may deactivated timing set safe slow work rare case wont start
guarantee run 3200 bought another stick 3200 mixing memory always increase chance doesnt work expected would run flex mode would 8gb8gb running dual channel remaining 8gb would run single channel 16gb memory needed imo unless need capacity likely going result situation
recommendation new 2x16 set replace get new 2x16 3200 ddr4 set 50 unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably dont use timing case way either motherboard try figure youre customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip youd make sure pretty thorough stability test
gpu might worth trying boot integrated graphic assume boot drive showing bios
reset bios unplugging psu either shorting cmos pin 10 second hitting button motherboard second removing cmos battery 30 second
tried fresh install window get another boot drive test existing boot drive rule corrupt o
long let attempt boot window cpuramboot led debug light lighting memory training am5 take first boot talking minute ten minute
possible something happened boot expo file corrupted try boot install medium see reset way
yes boot drive showing bios actually already dont gpu pc yet im going try 50 series day assembled rest pc yesterday make sure everything working
unfortunately ive done 10 time bring bios reset default setting trying boot still hang black screen
dont think window issue booted window fine yesterday used pc little enabling expo get back
let run 20 minute instance earlier attempt yellow light come resetting cmos reinstalling ram made go away
look restore memory context thing change auto enabled fresh window install may worth seeing cant boot usb install medium reinstall also update bios possible thing would try
even without enabling expo made sure trying boot base 4800mts ram speed
id check boot sequence see stage boot process get past always accurate help point fails boot im sure yellow light mean particular motherboard sound strange booting anymore even resetting cmos back default
yes fresh window install also updated bios yesterday beforehand im already latest version restoring memory context
yes ive hit disable expo bios well manually chosen 4800mt clock speed way boot anymore
httpswwwredditcomramdsdzoxrivizi look thread found see may possibly help pretty old would thought updated bios would rule hey never know uh yea would personally try see even boot usb window install medium least troubleshooting reinstalling window could fix issue would eliminate headache
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
yes window drive first boot order actually able boot window use computer earlier since enabling expo everything got messed debug led none
see youve tried either stick time tried slot worst thing think possibly hardware issue either cpu fully socketed one ram channel dead even ram issue
im pretty sure everyone forgets psu switch io plate first time
forgot connect cpu power tried troubleshoot entire day gave sent part back forgot case pwr button cable god sake 30 year still dont easy standardized 1 connector case pin
getting 1k card payment plan getting debt
ok picture thisaustin texas 1995 saved meager money finally build pc shiny new 486dx spent day putting together bloodied finger case back death trap im feeling great hit power flicker life shuts missed dip switch miss cable everything look good wont work crestfallen verge tear slump chair wife say relax think little take advice next day renewed resolve take deeper look find missed fucking standoff board shorting case fixed like magic way dialup modem bb heaven

put stock intel cooler 10700k wondering overheating trying boot game
old guy tell youngins dark scary old day plug play operating system talking early 90 describe hardware bios example youd need enter block head sector hard drive correctly youd risk corrupting data bricking drive didnt data sheet could always try compuserve card needed memory space hardware needed unique interrupt assigned cabling nightmare ide scsi drive stiff 3 wide cable try routing 4 single box fan available 3 type loud louder intermittent buzzing good time
taking tiny little sticker bottom cpu cooler
standoff totally didnt know thing fan blipped first time powering could never get mobo cpu work
spent 2 hour wondering new build wouldnt post bios sketchy moniter cord wrong connection faulty mb etc driving insane nearly wanted post help google post sub well classic mistake youd think ram fully seated first time nope reseated booted bios
mobo came integrated io big first time mistake avoided conveniently rested wire back fan io hole safe keeping installed mobo realised wire still hanging though mobo squashing remove mobo reinstall took age first time around
back 2010 built first pc took 57 hour forgot thermal paste cpu
build first pc around 2016 help experienced friend pc build boot signal nothing check everything connected properly yep think ended giving troubleshooting almost 2 hour obviously secondary part lying around test took local pc repair shop next day troubleshootingdiagnostics charge around 15 eur 40 minute hour later swapping cpu gpu multiple ram kit etc testing improvement decided take motherboard component case try hooking another known working psu last resort still dice said motherboard must doa send replacement upon starting unplug psu cable suddenly started mumbling fuck fucking kidding appearantly forgot plug cpu 8pin power cable didnt notice neither upon inspection routed connector motherboard never connected connected connected powersupply cable pc booted immediately pc still working order day since year half new mobo power supply one friend current gaming pc old mobo gave shortly moving new friend place didnt charge 15 eur service fee since took almost hour max 5 min check fix slight win since ive build bunch pc acquired lot knowledge past 9 year point build troubleshoot pc eye closed friend family also side hustle earn extra cash number 1 instant check still see cpu power cable connected properly also say havent occasional little moment stress pc wasnt turning realising forgot switch power supply
first build actually went without hitch funny thing latest cpumobo upgrade last year rgb wouldnt work fan drove crazy verge making 3 hour drive microcenter returning everything eureka moment next morning work stupid as forgot plug everything rgb header done countless build without issue dumb oversight lol
first time bios war assumption twice voltage twice performance spoiler went good
bent pin massive understatement haha looong time ago like 2004 finally saved enough money upgrade ancient pc didnt know buddy said build pc problem came helped put cpu socket athlon 64 3000 everything fine tried mount cooler wouldnt fit anyway tried push twist somehow nothing time trying lifted cooler magic cpu socket yeah turned cpu sticked cooler tried force place many way brushed cpu pin across socket almost half pin bent like hell also couple broken also managed kill motherboard save money another 10 month buy new stuff back 2020 build new system without gpu impossible get one finally got 3070 two month later excited ala turned wont fit pcie slot doesnt tried like 15 minute even put lot force nothing sad figured either faulty gpu maybe damaged transport faulty motherboard broken pcie something went put gpu box send back thats realized gpu still plastic cover pcie connector
didnt put mobo standoff cut io shield
cable tie anything could use cable management also didnt screwdriver forgot order thermal paste started put thing together also lack usb stick could install window wifi driver
plugged usb hub bios usb port hell broke loose every time upgrade build run b wasnt used paying attention
life connect fan right direction know plug motherboard think im stupid honestly
first time tried build pc found one company build pc buy individual component vague idea much wanted purchase part concept actually needed make computer work computer arrived wouldnt turn call company rep told power supply purchased wasnt big enough pc return pc part upgraded complained power supply wasnt big enough didnt someone contact sending power supply knew wasnt big enough part available purchase set wasnt big enough explained knew little pc building assumed part list provided adequate long story short got full refund brother law help build ordering amazon newegg let suggest part would work together feel like thing really wrong enough research picking part also feel like said truth part picker build computer thats whole thing building pc scratch niche warning power supply insufficient said took rep word
nothing really thats honest also everything kind worked
helped friend order part build pc college part arrived friday heading home weekend told could build together monday well got little impatient threw together managed get everything put together went turn zap yeah forgot standoff felt bad guy lol
thought gpu shoddy kept plugging monitor igpu
first build last time upgraded gpu cpu fan went well wouldnt boot window troubleshooted everything could think realized stick ram wasnt fully pressed place pressed heard click immediately started laughing
sure mistake pretty sure oh well put cpu cooler first time wasnt well put together remove put lost track cpu turn stuck cooler xd guess didnt secure cpu socket well enough
ive built dozen pc still starting built brother pc everything going well pressed button little spark pop smoke started coming case turn forgot plug cpu plug motherboard thankfully mobo fried everything else good got replacement day later first last time ive ever seen pc go flame lol
friend make first build call one simple issue motherboard old bios version yet support cpu work sit read manual flash bios usb stick without cpu manufacturer worst case find older cpu get bios update
didnt select boot drive couldnt life figure red light mobo
buying gpu facebook marketplace doesnt work
afraid bricked something static find havent connected power cable gpu
propperly seating cpu cooler 34 screw 4th one couldnt screw dont know decided 3 wouldnt cause much trouble left like month later replaced one amd stock coller one cooler master
shit psu came case
used old external hdd family picture window know worked 12 let say mom wasnt happy gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
issue building pc first time screw ssd nvme2 samsung one box mobo seem one either disaster good 30min untill decided watch bunch unboxing building pc video mobo realised small screw different small package promotion manual page mobo box would legit find ever
spending 500 ssd ram instead vram gpu
dumbest mistake building budget pc ended spending 2x much upgrading time saved little first got quality component right bat
didnt connect front panel switching pc touching pin metal touched motherboard z270 realeased burned
buying 80387 coprocessor chip go along 80386 cpu really need math coprocessor time 80386 would plenty
added graphic card thought purpose display bought cheapest card could hdmi using tv time hd 6670 quickly replaced
built first pc 2011 loved always felt better jump forward 2020 big tear reinstall noticed switch mb normally meant overlocking basically stunted cpu couldnt cook turn nine year 37ghz cpu operating max 07
connected external cooling fan wrong connector started pc rgbs fan popped fan still work quarter fan light permanently dark blue color
plugging psu cable installing case man fiddly
first powered pc aios kraken elite screen didnt turn thought cause needed download software something powered pc temp spiked nearly immediately trying debug pushed power cable pump little bit screen turned turn even powered cause connector loose
brother building first pc would turn dont know brother tough maybe switch psu help switched 220 v 110 v magic smoke discovered live europe got 220 v face expecting 110 time cheap
usb didnt use header block individual pin hooked one wrong im way booted literally caught fire burned usb header still worked otherwise though
first one built brother dont count built one month ago display took mc ram slot 3 4 v 2 4 hell know
got case fan side panel happened align directly air cooler remove fan entirely pointless gotten first place also immediately forgetting hardware turned worked instantly dumped information head fast forward 7 8 year idea could run modern game didnt know check
somehow killed 8700 bought 13900k
mistake ive seen vga cable inserted monitor jack screwed upsidedown coworker impressive strength first build case didnt come standoff couldnt find preweb google figured important something case mobo assembled pc layer foam conductive foam mobo shipped friend took repair shop never told outcome probably didnt want embarrass
forgot gpu clamp existed trying reseat gpu yanked entire slot motherboard luckily 2 equivalent slot plugged second one several year random pin sticking motherboard
buddy bent cpu pin like 3 hour straightening got work guess random weirdness pc guess attribute cpu pin bending suspect could something else good story try nitpick didnt bother trying give tech support haha
early 2000s component purchased online newegg afraid breaking something applying much force seating heatsink cpu ended sort resting top hit power heard pop watched soul cpu floated away small puff smoke think rmad half build question asked newegg awesome back day
taking apart clean prebuilt ended extra cable doesnt turn
spent extra bought 900w psu gon na cross fire 7970 ghz edition year use squeeze life cross fire sli got dropped never got
forced usb c cord motherboard upside gifemotefreeemotespackflipout
day thought broke pin cpu installation learn cpu never pin
well recent build spent hour troubleshooting display driver reseating gpu cleaning port etc second monitor would get picture matter hard tried turn bad displayport cable
got first pc december couple week ago bought pair presonus eris 35bt speaker great sounded great nice loud jamming guitar like week ago suddenly started stuttering lot couldnt figure searched tried many thing nothing worked thing changed recently installed fan hub pc also got set steelseries arctic wireless headphone figured headphone maybe interfering something know solution work pc installing fan hub unplugging everything removed wifi antenna figured use ethernet dont need idea also needed bluetooth screwed antenna back speaker work perfectly
build yesterday miswired power button connection nothing powering keyboard lighting knew mobo getting power overconfident dummy initially built inside case took everything built mobo box realized error take apart back case output monitor another 45min troubleshooting saw monitor power cable wasnt plugged thankful issue indeed user error
pulling 500w 500w supply never exploded probably single digit amount watt sounded like lawnmower heavy gaming seshes
20 year ago child pulled pentium 4 socket cooler thought could push back never saw much bend pin trusty hairdryer flathead screwdriver able fix never bend pin since
way back 2000when wasnt rgb glass side panel built computer forgot connect fan cpu air cooler computer worked perfectly fine one day opened cleaning 6 7 month later saw fan connected soon computer boot youd get thermal alert throttling minute
went mobo doesnt wifi bluetooth built regret decision
helped coworker troubleshoot first build cuz issue found screwed mobo straight case without using standoff
didnt consider cable management space selected case made build 10x frustrating needed
got obsessed looking sale deal probably spent month researching different component searching best value pc totally fine last 10 year couple gpu upgrade along way probably wasnt worth spending much time researching signing deal alert save 200 buck total
long ago would sell case power supply remember janky diablotek psu blow didnt know better kid enjoying first custom build extremely fortunate didnt take component sure smelled like burnt electronics idea diagnosed issue something eventually told buy new psu sure enough hooking everything pc alive
forgot plug power button everything perfect except power button panicked good 10 minute trying figure wouldnt work felt like total genius
plugging power button probably also least forgot plug power cable cpu
0 cable management first build
installed cooler bracket way wasnt able secure peerless assassin forgot plug 24 pin panicked pc wasnt turning
got shitty case bad airflow r5 3600 1080ti sweating bullet inside please spare headache get mesh front intake case side size least 2 120mm fan
forgot take little bracket installing cooler left tiniest gap cpu didnt notice thing would shut 15 second luckily found problem quickly haha
motherboard doesnt support usb3 front panel connector usb2 front panel usb lol
futureproofing build ended upgrade cpu gpu mobo later
installed cpu cooler fan blowing away heatsink took figure cpu ran hot even idle
noctua cpu fan stuck case allowed couldnt close glass pane properly 1 tb space ran within 4 game properly quality control check monitor found dead pixelsback light bleeding return exchange use xmp profile ram stick
biggest regret trying build low budget gave 600 dollar thought would enough build something could least run game wanted fast forward around year already cant run stalker 2 basically unreal engine 5 game struggle really hard
forgot io plate forgot remove cpu sticker remembered quickly due multitude image using modular psu used wrong psu port videocard cable
ensuring pushed am4 cpu fully mobo taking repaste installing cooler shitting wouldnt boot
first pc build recent one power button seamlessly integrated case design literally didnt see mashing rgb light button wondering wouldnt power triple checked connection reseated everything looked diagram case make sure header plugged right noticed power button thought
plugged pc case power button fan wrong haha couldnt start pc wondering read manual mobo
getting prebuilt instead custom
buying mobo cpu compatible
everyone forgets psu switch didnt forgot press power button case dont know thats better worse
tried work powered touched audio chip metal zapped use sound card lol
installed latest window 11 update shut connected android phone via usb turned pc gainward rtx 3060 fan running output sure killed rtx left preowned gt 710 cant cry enough shelled cash preowned setup
havent built pc year missed io plate forgot take cover vga port think know mean im always nervous hell cpu install managed get paste underside cpu luckily side could wipe continue surprisingly front usb always managed get one go
mean putting psu upside seems tough mess ive done least twice
bought 487 coprocessor go 386 cpu got work though socket compatible 487 returned result cpu 386 ready ended cutting motherboard trace soldering delay line timing would work
im older first time getting case fried whole thing cost 2700 fix inflation adjust dollar wore grounding strap fried another motherboard lazy early 2000s grounding cant hurt
network driver window wifi lost ethernet wasnt working still dont understand happened since window usually come generic driver
biggest mistake son made following crowd mentality watching review understanding process important still need check need could saved time money would gotten endless rabbit hole better future proof pleased built didnt realize longer path went assessed build enjoy process fun problem solving frustrating happening really appreciate solved issue know build feel lot accomplished good luck
plugging monitor motherboard hdmi instead gpu lmaooo
added gpu didnt know activate bios msi lga 775 window xp
plugging cpu power
forgot plug simply mobo power cord lol
bought wrong connector wifi instead mhf4 bought ufl connector slightly bigger pin adapter causing didnt clamp kept coming
io plate second build
back elementary school knew needed uprade graphic card play game better setting around time graphic card started sometimes additional power pin required psu went passively cooled gpu realize two type common slot gpus agpwhich pciewhich gpu well quite disappointed found
forgot remove protective film cooler wondered ran hot bit
bought part help friend done hitting buy button decided change psu much cheaper one brand probably invented make single oosu fine year buy new motherboard cpu addition psu blew spent three year much worse cpu money tight overspent fancy psu avoid issue
first pc built joy use went budget grabbing 7800x3d 9800 wasnt yet 4070tis gpu 6000mhz ram gigabyte x670 mobo fully modular power supply putting together threw monitor plugged keyboard mouse prayed screen came bios thanked god noticed temp cpu touch high started getting higher pc shut terrified thought either defective unit air cooler wasnt sufficient triple checked connection tried thing power high temp steadily rising shutoff didnt want throw power knew happening cpu cooler clearly support bracket correctly paste spreading albiet much yeah make sure check exactly cooler supposed mounted mine barely touching transferring basically heat felt like giant doofus remove plastic applied proper amount paste least shame doesnt help isnt making contact fixed temp steady around 30 celcius mark sigh relief engaged
picture 2005 online building guide website ancient helpful youtube doesnt really good tutorial yet either resource instruction manual came case motherboard manual badly translated chinese english two biggest first time mistake install standoff bracket came case instruction said nothing could figure front panel power connector manual vague go motherboard ended take shop take look able get fixed quickly showed screwed
tried add gpu dell optiplex sent gpu back working turn turn legacy rom turn secure boot bios
building first x86 amd computer 1998 believe amdk5pr75 turned computer junkie dumbest mistake money could saved
many time ive performed maintenance gaming rig forgot plug power back gpu wondered screen blank post
installed cpu cooler without removing protective sticker
plugging hdmi motherboard gpu took 40 staring blank screen wondering computer wont work
didnt get ram seated ram speckle
knowing better getting cheap psu also buying case proprietary fan connector fortunately psu hasnt blown yet im looking solving soon case fan ill give case brother whenever want build new pc
pcpartpicker selected hyte y70 instead y60 hakos bae case led liquid freezer 3 compatible ended corsair titan rx added rx fan side intake got sale worth end

wrong form factor mobo case ended without rig 2 week cuz mistake
recent build put fan backwards phantom spirit version bought different others logo side push air pushing warm air case without anything pumping noticed temp bit high fixed dropped 10 degree one thing rather proud using barbecue lighter see way air flowing
forgot 1 standoff one right gpu slot gpu didnt seat correctly pc still kinda worked unusable thing build night huge lan despite getting lot help didnt find issue hour went home pc worked flawlessly 30 minute got back home fixed issue
hdmi cable mobo even tho gpu xd
connected cpu fan pin rgb stripe motherboard close thought place wrong soon turned pc fan working frontal one 3 second died felt stupid person earth since thought fried whole computer fortunately nothing happened switched cable right place worked like charm never problem 45 year
forgot io plate forgot take blue plastic film ssd heat sink forgot standoff didnt know plug front connector name
every 3rd computer build io panel installed forgot
thanks sending memory lane trying see could remember first pc build im going guess late 80 around 10 frankensteining together old part would hoard bedroom closet instead letting dad throw away remember one early junk build paradise brand graphic card tough get working came tshirt cheesy beach graphic paradise logo dont know happened shirt regret losing track day let call first big pcbuilding mistake
ran first custom loop year sticker cpu block
fan blowing wrong direction
dont remember first time long ago get regret buying hardware first place 1 week 1 month new better gpu cpu come make mine look like toaster ive prone upgrading every 2 year less im holding ive yet made 1 year im tempted upgrade addiction
realize motherboard standoff essential component build purposely ignored thinking cosmetic thing people wanted interior look nice computer wouldnt even boot dismantle 80 build get installed
first pc build gpu wrong slot year boy feel stupid figured wonder game crashed almost constantly
building small form factor suffering get everything fit build wire zip tied place realized never plugged power switch disassembled whole computer placed cable terminal took around hour dice still turning troubleshot 3 hour went bed returned following day took apart start metering stuff discovered power button connector plugged backwards
getting voodoo 5 birthday month went business meant updated driver back actually needed updated driver even run new game community driver eventually got ati 9700 instead
plugged 5v pin 12v fortunately rgbs
used amd fx8350 save buck immediately performance issue almost every modern game crazy far amd come since
bent almost pin cpu rip pentium 4
first time building pc everything good go first boot met error slotted ram incorrectly okay problem well took hr 4am trouble shootin swapping ram pc would turn id get display tried every single ram slot variation using 1 stick everything find first swapped ram mustve slightly unplugged gpu power thats display probably started first guild midnight lol year later reddit saved another minor issue took week trouble shooting take pc repair store mouse stutter constantly tried everything new mouse pad new mouse tried old mouse different pc worked fine issue seemed pc reinstalled window driver everything could think turn mouse stutter caused slightly loose hdmi cord going 2nd monitor everything worked fine mouse funny thing didnt find reddit post talking loose hdmi cord caused mouse stutter probably would never found issue take pc repair store issue would resolved unplugging everything take pc
didnt consider size case relation size video card tight fit unscrew shift gpu cooler odd position make work basically wasnt coming back time replace made damn sure new pc issue p
went itxhttpscapcpartpickercombyx4d4d cable management hell room proper cpu cooling specific order put everything together definitely didnt follow took entire day build computer dont learn hard mode kid
actually recent second build dumbest plugged front io cable case com pin front io pin troubleshooted almost hour realizing much idiot first build mostly marred knowing much tension ram slot cpu door needed
paying attention interrupt request available motherboard comparing expansion card got everything work modem dip switch small selection interrupt none available motherboard basically incompatible understood sure schedule colonoscopy year
yep forgot standoff first time friend teaching let make mistake told wrong noticed thing werent lining forgot io shield time also forgot buy thermal paste twice run best buy time
put cpu cooler tr p 120 se wrong orientation 180 degree still seemed fit gpu though turned around regardless
making sure case right size pc part picker said would fine building could life get cpu cooler nzxt one little screen end putting cooler front case instead top cooler setup funky take panel front hut work measure twice
broke every little leg io plate didnt understand push bit motherboard better one upgrading o drive sata ssd nvme somehow installed window weirdest way possible boot part still old ssd o nvme ssd die im fucked die isnt connected exactly happened upgraded cpu recently discovered much ive fucked x
strangely mistake time tried build friend mine pc didnt check everything fitted told check forgot lol ended mounting aio rad front rather top
didnt realize hard snap ram place wound seating correctly going nut trying figure wouldnt work took two day one tech savvy friend spent hour facetime suddenly asked properly seated told lean really push heard snap sound soon presto
didnt cable manage cable sticking body case
plugging something realizing
forgot plug gpu power supply wondering computer wasnt posting like 2 hr
installed fan backward fan pulling air case found month later layer dust outside case getting pulled
would put fan slot pentium 3 whatever since cpu encased hard plastic need actively cooled luckily kept shutting didnt melt completely
didnt used spacers mobo case puff
case wasnt large enough gpu wait another week one show
well let see first time problem month ago let see took cover cpu mobo interface bent 3 pin like n00b tiny tweasers magnifying glass hour somehow missed fan slot put last one kept mobo booting thought fried cpu turn didnt plug cable first slot pretty dumb mistake
buddy completed first build wasnt able go help day got part hed gotten everything done hooking psu installing gpu head help wrap plug aaaaand nothing figure maybe dvi hdmi try cord without success even run home grab another cord long story short ram wasnt seated fully
research
initial build upgrading gpu first time ripped entire pcie slot plugged new gpu next slot surprisingly ill effect lol
realising graphic card second power plug need
plugged cable psu came without checking one actually needed installed everything tried figure everything went realized clogging thing making cable management impossible took everything started took like hour figure lol
11 shorted mobo 13 deleted window wouldnt boot hell bent bin build last year luckily bent back
plugged sata cable upside silverline psu blew hard drive
couldnt figure computer kept turning second smartphones didnt good way debugging either eventually accidentally found probing unseated part cpu burned learned cpu need cooler
friend spread thermal paste inside pc frosting cake
thought first pc broken didnt know install driver motherboard smart kid
watch build guide verge
instantly burned brand new cpu happened back early 2000 athlon64 didnt thermal damage protection whatsoever forgot properly secure cooler created tiny gap cooler cpu turned power instantly smelled burned electronics buy new cpu learned important lesson day
power supply screw wrong one friend thought friend help u demanded 200 dollar helping
immense amount paranoia building first one triple checked every move made build took damn near 11 hour worth since everything put together lasted solid 9 year counting problem mistake made minor one hit power button checked cpu fan make sure everything good noticed cpu fan barely turning immediately powered everything check connection tried turn cpu fan looked like barely rotating lighting put direct light could see fan full speed
lmao ive built thousand pc weekend almost issue power switch power bar flipped
2003 building intel northwood processor cpu required separate 4pin 12v connector power beyond 20pin atx connector provided read manual thoroughly noted completely forgot building pc would turn strain eg running neverwinter night wasted summer figuring time rmad cpu motherboard genuinely believed hardware fault
friend mine built pc helped pick part first build back 2011 dont know uncommon didnt want pay modular power supply didnt get one regretted extra cable case pain case wasnt built cable management build bluray drive moved drive lower case could shove unused cable cable slack gap top case drive second thing case year case fan would rattle one hard drive one video card issue assumed fan dying replaced still rattled id smack side case every time rattled would stop
first time went well forgot plug power connector 1070 either specific bios message insufficient power gpu figured 30 second second time hell time hand couldnt get driver including networking driver importantly work installing window 25 day later realized using window install drive 2016 old made new installation key problem went away
using 2 pcie cable daisy chaining 3080 working fine first month started display issue bought new 850w psu replace 750w psu thinking problem realize needed 3 separate pcie cable plugged learned internet coworker issue
moved cpu tad bit mounting didnt lift turned bent bunch pin mobo
forgot snap little bar lock cpu turned case upright cooler installed yet cpu plopped broke
decade ago one many standoff forgot leave one based motherboard called touching component back motherboard checked removed pc fired lasted quite long life
switched reset ground cable case causing one dont remember catch fire
cheap smart like dad sorted cheap needed play game wanted bought accordingly shit obsolete really fast lowspecgaming community bigger test buy cheap go obsolete immediately cheap expensive guy
forgot io shield didnt plug cpu power cable remembered turn power supply switch though forgot turn outlet wall couldnt figure wouldnt boot
letting 2 friend help knew everything came together fast fast forward 10 year realized idea confident set aside lot less time needed super easy right hand learn either way big deal
would light output time assumed bad motherboard got replacement im pretty sure didnt push ram far enough first one lol 100 like least 70
thought mine broken cause flipped psu switch nothing happened keyboard turning got ta hit power button mb dur
got intel cpu instead amd
first pc long time ago probably setting jumper correctly irq drive master slave set course didnt start building system spending year frankenstein rebuilds existing prebuilds hdd ram upgrade gained lot experience beforehand
help teacher first time built computer nothing crazy went however ago tried insocket upgrade new processor wouldnt work updated bios old processor without putting cooler upgraded platform last year put motherboard noticed would break bracket case one soldered one already put motherboard could life remove pull motherboard
window kept crashing install took 3 hour figure put 1 ram chip installing window put 2nd
forgot pull sticker part cpu cooler connects cpu wondering cpu got hot started stuttering high load fortunately fixed couple day damage yet
thought switching psu actually turning cried went bed woke realized pressed power switch powered right oh forgot click ssd place properly confused window wouldnt install gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
going mini itx didnt space constraint putting pc made difficult upgrade road due interior space constraint limited selection component
think stripping mobo screw pc case thankfully pretty inconsequential
plugging monitor io instead gpu classic streamed building twitch show friend issue
first second stupidly forgot remove protective plastic top cpu installed cooler never started computer still waiting addition part night lying bed strangest feeling fd stupidly left plastic even though knew watching many installation video got next day inspected work sure enough could see tab plastic cover sticking cooler thankfully thats dumbest thing ive done far
wouldnt post two hour troubleshooting later found ram wasnt seated way
literally built saturday booted first time patted back took look creation realised cpu cooler upside work fine upsidedown artctic logo starting bother
picked amd system
upgraded gtx 1080 3080 upgrading rig fitting wouldnt boot properly checked everything started troubleshooting concluded 3080 faulty went customer service site bought spent age chatting person online decided send back shop twice took 2 week tested said fine working properly transported rig cousin house verdict turn didnt plug 2nd psu cable 3000 series need assumed required 1 like 1080 gaming friend circle still crack joke day
choosing cool gamer case chose cool zalman z11 case turned bitch clean sidepanel fan died year
old one first pc built amd pr75 cpu upgraded cyrix p133 couldnt even install window 95 thing kept crashing install process tried going back window 31 fine everyone still using do game anyway eventually something really wanted win95 started playing around see problem discovered worked fine changed core voltage 34v instead recommended 33v still dont know operated fine 16bit software 32bit oh another old one atx form factor power switch pc used directly attached psu switch completing circuit main current flowed testing part psu removed case picked switch without noticing plastic sleeving covered bare terminal slipped flicked 240v across hand cant say enjoyed much
way back old day fancy sound werent built motherboard generic sb clone wanted connect motherboards speaker sound card hear better somehow plugged wrong wire melted smoked reading fine manual told speaker header sound card connection motherboard internal speaker
idk mistake really dumb moment haha built first pc month ago motherboard got didnt support cpu box told tried bios flash thing anything else got flash drive renamed file stuck hit button flashed like 2 second turned every video watched said would take minute scared messed tried ton thing like hour girlfriend getting upset wasting time since building pc together stopped moved fast forward first boot everything worked fine recognized cpu im still sure worked lied im relieved run amazingly
think common mistake building first pc setting jumper right wondering piece shit computer booting oh forgot set jumper
buying superdiskls120 coming completely wasted money could gotten vanta much better performance 8mb permedia ii video card landed
worst mistake made getting motherboard sata port lol
screwed motherboard directly case fair first ever time building pc obviously mistake like ever repeated though forget power switch least every time build pc
spent 2 hour trying figure light pc wasnt turning never plugged monitor
extremely sick severe mental fog excited finally build forgot motherboard spacers screwed mobo directly case smelled exactly like imagine tried fire
spending extra money motherboard pci isa slot instead getting cheaper pcionly board putting extra money toward better modem
plug cpu psu cable gpu
didnt put motherboard standoff wondering wouldnt fit lol tbf dumb reason every tutorial watched decided mention step luckily realized something wasnt right didnt force screw
wired jfp1 incredibly wrong pc would boot took pc repair shop moved connector around booted straight away issue pc 10 year
ram wrong slot go computer shop get laughed
put cheap wireless card build confused internet speed horrible turn antenna provided absolutely horrible moved router closer used different antenna good go sometimes start easiest step forgot
aio fan pulling case instead pushing lol
built first pc everything went exactly planned save fighting intels really stupid snap stud system laminar stock cooler watch video unblock one easy enough though literally thing perfect wouldnt give display everything posted everything good everything everything fact gpu wasnt plugged thought 3060 ti sli port turn port pcie power issue adding another hard drive scratching head second switched disk boot priority problem solved know enough build second pc
installing lian li tl lcd fan upside assuming werent powering defective moronic design though honestly shouldnt able connect power supply cord wrong end definitely otherwise flawless victory shau khan status first build
using shitty component
vetting brand enough even certain marketplace almost gave hobby getting burned tigerdirect thats one young one might ever heard
forgot order thermal paste ordered waited arrive found cpu cooler came preapplied thermal paste
bought cheap gpu cuz blower model didnt know gon na loud af drown audio even headphone xx always gon na get 3 fan model
20 year ago forgot use standoff completely killed motherboard cpu somehow fine less expensive lesson might
couldnt figure gpu wouldnt fit thought incompatible mobonope forgot take little pcie protective thingy
forgot plug cooler pin thought mobo failing detecting cooler
didnt know motherboard standoff actually 2nd build first pc raised motherboard mount new case didnt idea put little standoff shorted board right
rgb fan werent working correctly tried everything except software update
first 2 pc went smooth third aio plugged fan header right next cpu fan header sooooo much trouble shooting realized stupid mistake
didnt use standoff motherboard working fine couple year didnt
put 1070 pcie 1x slot couldnt figure graphic looked poor year
brother spazzing monitor wasnt working plugged hdmi mobo
forgot put standoff case couldnt understand wouldnt boot brought tech expert work figured pretty much immediately thankfully nothing fried much likely back second pc build though friend felt extra bad
starting budget build going full stupid halfway buying part twice isnt fun sound like
1st crack idea standoff frank memory little fuzzy pre2000 remember mobo would flop somehow side case shorting stuff anyways mad dumb eventually someone explained standoff b mobo flopping side case bad bad bad got eventually attempt 2 god know second crack understood idea standoff short took thing far looking standoff saw metal case metal standoff forming circuit back board went overkill making sure screw board insulated passing voltage quite kind problem shit dying inside pc cause standoff supposed offer ground static go case psu wall could write book stupid shit pre2k didnt want anywhere near stuff
forgot motherboard riser wouldnt turn like pulled board weird way figured happening lmao
oh let see bought pentium 4 clear move athlon 64 bought dual gpu motherboard didnt support sli bought inferior graphic card immediately paid much replacement best buy
didnt happen first build one time applied much thermal paste seeped onto motherboard month
one case fan plugged socket thats behind gpu know monumentally important hub back solitary little guy life head rent free
used thought plastic standoff ended breaking 6 month use 2nd pc put together spent hour trying figure wouldnt post ignorance assumed either cpu motherboard would able post bios without graphic card installed wrong
first pc built always ran really hot desk always assumed finally built new pc 4 year later forgot another year new build come back old desktop set living room open find exhaust fan came case never plugged 5 year later finally found ran hot
forgot ram ordered every single part would need except damn ram 10 year ago friend still bring fact forgot order ram clearly need better memory
computer one fan command stripped replacing part year ago lost screw something genuinely cant remember hasnt bitten yet time tell
bent cpu pin fortunately able bend back straighten plier
thought installed front header connection correctly spent 30 minute getting frustrated worried broke something thankfully easy embarrassing fix
thinking buck naked anti static strap wrist building didnt short anything second explaining wife needed buck naked kitchen carpet build
dumbest mistake upgrading cooler old am4 build bent pin 5600x damaged socket removing old air cooler knew better still managed pull feat plus side kid able upgrade build spare component plan use remaining part na
ram stick right next
back 2016 changing cpumotherboard new one somehow thought would genius set carpet floor shocked completely killed brand new board gotten lol
forgot cpu power cable
dont even remember first pc build guess mistake taking photo would well digital photo thing maybe earliest pc build remember gigantic dualpentium tower spent way much money probably around 19961997 zero recollection record built never bought premade dell gateway anything like also dont remember buying motherboard chassis separately
went reddit advice kidding course bought upgrade kit unsupported ram am5 build super unstable 5600mhz till day rocking 4800mhz
ive built one pc everything ready go two cable motherboard switched around didnt turn eventually figured glass case exploded granite tile counter
dumbest mistake made going full rgb saw robey build white lian li xl blinded color
cheaped processor got cyrix instead pentium dont ever buy fastest current cpu ill never buy slowest ever
small bean installing aio making sure psu connection made annoying
upgrade wife pc new ram graphic card went boot kept restarting didnt set ram way happens
bought triple channel build sticked ram next enabled xml 4 year latest mistake bending little metal io plate hole
accounting case size future graphic card upgrade microsoft atx great dont plan upgrading man atx case give better airflow allows flexibility graphic card
taking 4 hour lmao forgot io shield 3rd one got overconfident moved fast lol
going rgb build pretty good job may say adhd turn flashing blinking spinning light corner eye unbearably distracting even solid stationary color ended much spent fair amount turn day never use
bought case thought looked cool button top pressed make front panel slowly slide open reveal drive powerreset button really cool week slowly got sick waiting thing move broke panel next build utilitarian antec case solid airflow filter easy access io undersized build used case next three personal pc im getting rid want usbc port front panel
bad backplate mount aio wouldnt provide solid contact blockcpu temperature issue lived year thinking system ran hot aware problem denial far dumbest building mistake end getting different aio give issue
put riser wrong spot shorted mobo
accidentally bought ddr ram instead ddr2 kinda new time didnt know different
putting io shield ever lol
old psu two switch one power 2nd one eco mode turned eco mode switch trying figure pc would turn
psu somehow set 120v 240v switch back im ukdid go well
1st ever cpu motherboard dx4 cpu put cpu board didnt boot panic went actual repair shop looked turn inserted cpu wrong way everything ok tho laughed
biggest mistake ignorant extraneously testing 8tb hardrive bought amazon beforehand drive completely died long purchasing lost lot data thinking new would fine ironically new drive worry building pc fairly easy though make sure read manual come purchase youll straight
buying super expensive case time around 140 2014 pretty expansiv case time like buy 200 case today mean big nice clean think simpler one would bean ok yea know 120 case isnt much want wall mounted one one optionbrand
20 year ago powered pc find main power source motherboard wasnt plugged psu properly
sticker came amd cpu back day thick sticker come cpu right put cpu attached heatsink even lying never noticed problem cpu werent hot back
dumbest mistake made building first pc thats easy buying seagate barracuda hard drive immediately replacing despite recall list 2008s recall thinking oh theyre recall list fine joke still bricked even though werent part recall list break magically added recall list id already lost data never buy seagate product ever youve lost customer never ever buy product ever lived forever would never buy product ever
mucking cooler master 212 evo use stock intel cooler picked 212 black edition
done building started first try flat thing still box oh mr io shield well shit spent 15minutes convincing self need io shield back offk
ive ever built one pc scratch friend mine bought component afraid tackle thing messed power reset button got backwards somehow lol several minute hitting power button nothing happening eventually hit reset button hell powered right would easy fix didnt care left way early 20 pretty proud pride increased little year later guy bought stuff build way better pc instead letting put together another friend dude master degree something computer related maybe im guessing thats chose guy forgot one corner mb standoff point went install something made loud popcracking noise stopped went back installed standoff im pretty sure late im remembering correctly pc never worked right replace mb even get running doubt guy surely way knowledge came pc go show even someone master degree still make rookie mistake guess ill find still im getting ready put together son pc
20 year ago 15 16 gotten first paycheck working student job whole month july part ordered uncle going help put together come gpu wouldnt fit bought pcie card motherboard agp didnt know difference uncle didnt see everything together could go store return mom went store best angry mom ranting guy refunded card gave agp one instead thinking back gone different motherboard pcie instead first pc used couple year time upgrade since agp card longer made also overclocked hard cpu burnt motherboard end lifetime month ago found old case good memory old nzxt case basically looked like power ranger
destroyed cpu didnt understand zif socket worked snapped least dozen pin bent rest dont think single pin left untouched time done defense eight thought knew
spent like whole day troubleshooting first pc figure image realize wasnt supposed plug monitor motherboard
swapping power supply cable
overspending ram faster mobo could handle overspending mobo feature never used lifetime overspending case tell upgrade ok overspend actually would sick sight time upgrade buy new one
plugging atx power mobo correctly one pin wasnt making contact felt special tech micro center pointed
first pc build hdmi cable hooked motherboard instead gpu bit mental breakdown thinking broke something realized felt dumb
built 4050 system think since 16 33 first build mistake plugged psu end cable sata hdd pcie hole zalman psu back 4 pin connector cpupcisata fried hdd glad atleast happened pc friend
didnt mount aio correctly pc would immediately shut post spent 2 hour tearing pc thinking something short feeling residual heat motherboard pcb cpu overheating finally noticed mistake building pc fun sometimes downright torture
didnt know different ram like ddr2 ddr3 bought part new computer set ddr2 ram got super excited unboxed everything started building realize ddr2 fit ddr3 ram slot wait week amazon deliver new set ddr3 ram
didnt realize motherboard cpu pin slightly bent design since got used freaked tried bending straight broke buy another one top trying use cheaper test model cpu didnt work get another original cpu
first pc one time another forgot io shield remembered io shield forgot check little metal ground finger right place sliding motherboard got caught io header bent front port blocked repurposing older motherboard new machine cleared cmos using jumper removing battery forgot move jumper back got motherboard hair tightening installing gpu display port close edge slot couldnt get video cable
didnt push ram way thought build broke friend pointed fairly teased good hour afterwards
first build pentium massive spark melt power cord giant blue flame dad watching thought bury great laugh fortunately fixed problem put new cord ran fine lately messing rgb cable bent lga pin latest faux pa
ive built whole pc without testing part beforehand broken motherboard fully unbuild system pain as

deleting system32 got computer consequently building got hand hp pavilion started going folder thinking could delete unnecessary file rebooted bricked went best buy buy window xp install cd got fresh start whatever reason really got tinkering point since built dozen pc family friend
preparing build kept seeing dont forget flip power switch absolutely forget flip power switch psu imac 8 year one power button didnt think press button front case well built twice outside case inside took shop said couldnt find issue turned right nice build charged 100 dollar turning pc might charged less didnt realize got home
didnt fully insert ram posted unstable like installing anything troubleshooting guide said update driver first literally couldnt took 3 frustrating hour blue screen death one restarts left debug led long enough figure
forgot io plate chose massive pc case reason cable management complete garbage
really high decided assemble everything popped cpu socket forgot lock stuck heat sink fan bent every pin cpu started sliding around neighbor painting figurine massive magnifying glass fucking dude bent every pin back straight popped back finished build worked 2007 still work day
ive done first build everything fine including thermal paste point working cable order hyte y40 5 phanteks m25 gen 2 argb fan one normal one using linq6 adapter 2 argb header two fan header
didnt route power cpu power 2 internet seemed divided whether needed also realized wrong psu wire going gpu needed remove motherboard switch wire two change worked perfectly
happened third pc finished building completely including giant noctua air cpu cooler put together im ready plug forgot put io shield way get without taking air cooler redo thermal paste bent shiny thing plier fit doesnt look amazing fine dont put io plate soon dont wait youre ready actually use io
example 1 using flat head screwdriver assist attaching cpu fan clip slipped took capacitor motherboard example 2 managed put ddr3 ram backwards powered south bridge chip burned almost immediately first experience electrical fire smell like
forgot standoff motherboard fried everything 30 year ago didnt dare year tower come built standoff
everything went well actually week someone notified there plastic film inside glass panel
dumbest mistake ive made overall first build 1012 year ago absolutely destroyed usb3 header front panel heard component pushed force instead checking make sure pin lined pushed harder eventually broke probably couldve survived without front panel usb3 bought new motherboard anyway dumbest mistake made recent build plugging power button
built first pc didnt really mess anything somehow unlucky enough get bad am3 motherboard bad psu confirmed testing friend part spent 2 day troubleshooting luck got friend bring working pc test part bunch combination realized 1 part defective im glad havent bad luck since lol also upgraded current pc got ryzen 3600x friend tried install pc wouldnt boot turn cpu bent pin didnt bother check pin installing idea bent friend gave brother able unbend pin ive never removed cpu since lol
shitty power supply shorted hour installation tripped breaker 3 time barrack realized going
didnt really mess build ordered part living campus excited got delivered noticei sprinted across campus get part moment knew messed walk huge box part including pc case back dorm bear hugged box might embarked journey felt like 4hrs back room tired finally made sat everything took nap course forgot connect video card power first boot started freaking looked side glass saw obvious screw im glad didnt ruin anything shaking part went
misplacing phillips head screwdriver
building single problem month later wouldnt show image going everywhere trying troubleshoot happened combination factor actually 1 main monitor plugged broken displayport broken enough recognized broken enough make monitor go crazy blinking red green blue black white straight signal message 2 second monitor still plugged would throw message saying signal 3 order troubleshoot bought motherboard speaker would sometimes troubleshooting process throw 1 long beep 3 rapid fire beep indicating ram issue might expect together pia nothing soon unplugged dp second monitor said hi something display
bought intel cpu amd mobo luckily cousin let know could cancel lmao
scared push memory stick way tried troubleshoot month rebuilt clicked right
back day motherboards came tiny speaker diagnostic beep didnt bother putting turned pc wouldnt post without took quite figure
weirdly none
building pc guess going looooonnnggggg checklist hahahaha
pinched fan cable case port motherboard didnt notice done building done cable still fan work nothing blocked
knew monitor display cable connect directly gpu couldnt find gpu port gpu connected monitor motherboard instead obviously didnt work spent hour troubleshooting discovering gpu perfectly usable port covered socket protector apparently smarter toddler
think issue plugged monitor gpu using hdmi wouldnt display screen switch dp idea time
even building first pc last year im nearly 50 rushed i7 11700 installation boxing day wondered retention lever wasnt going way cpu wasnt properly plenty bent pin socket tried best fix tweezer bin motherboard worst bit timing wait another 2 day another board felt proper waste 100 carelessness
back day swapped p8 p9 plug spent next couple hour trying figure couldnt get signal
standoff idea supposed use got lucky learned damaging anything
flipping negative positive power switch connector mobo pc kept power cycling took hour calling buddy figure haha last weekend another build experience knew immediately
io plate first 2 remembered hard stuff easiest thingjust forgot
spent day throubleshotting pc build would turn would restart loop forever took apart several time find pin atx power supply would go way
forgot thermal paste cpu initial problem display getting recognised random shut down
gifted nice pc decided upgrade keeping motherboard 800 later nice 8 year old pc maxed also first time putting gpu tried pull back realign tore pcle slot find old used motherboard fit old spec piece
thing psu switch first build took 15 minute figure
many moon ago spent day troubleshooting new system recognizing hard drive realize hadnt setup masterslave jumper correctly
first pc recent one thought hardware issue install window 11 kept black screening midway tried reinstall window five time course afternoon trying troubleshoot myriad potential issue along way turn hdmi switch flipping channel equally pissed also relieved found dreading hardware fault
wasnt hardware issue machine turned posted first try wouldnt load bios finally said eff roll dice booted window install thumb drive fine much later finally realized problem faulty assumption machine would boot bios without keyboard input cause o board got bios ez pz
used tv monitor plugged hdmi cord mobo hdmi slot instead gpu freaked video signal oh psu switch course
tried put hdd drive interior case put mobo innicked capacitor somehow ruined big lesson learned lol
dragged case building across thick carpet bricked board cpu go back ancient pc pulled dumpster another month
first pc build screwed motherboard directly metal case rathet little metal screw riser hit powet would run 1 second short instantly power back 2004 place like youtube even existed kind winged since sell previous dell prebuilt pc get enough money build one access internet anyway want pc shop bought part showed super friendly told wrong 30 second looking shout sw electronics tucson
plugged power supply cable motherboard backwards atx improved standard couldnt
tried turn pc cpu heatsink pc would turn right away forced power fried cpu
much building part purchasing thing bought x570 mobo wish would gone b550 instead dont really get much value extra stuff x570 brings upgraded anything way thought would ram kind waste money hey work like pc dont sweat
back ide day set jumper back hard drive order detect properly well messed around completely forgot later plugged everything could get boot reinstall window drive took whole day could search problem internet
booted bios thought pc unresponsive forgot plug mouse keyboard
alright think contender mid 2000s junior high maybe technically second pc ever built first time friend helped first time im solo im super excited got everything together fire computer start smell burning turn right away try figure smell coming power supply seems ok hard drive good gpu issue smell coming cpu run dad ask help take apart although remembered thermal paste put wrong side cpu best clean cpu socket board melted bit kept around number year remind failure honestly dont know didnt fry cpu thing ran probably decade
gpu didnt fit case
tightening screw accidentally scratching motherboard trace leaving option warranty rejected buy brand new x570 gaming plus motherboard best lesson learnt thru hard miserable way still mobo work kept backup whatever happens happens reason
thinking everything would work first time
didnt know cpu needed power cable
absolute braindead moment day ago got new cpu cooler wanted clean old thermal paste cpu ryzen 7 saw dust am5 socket thought clean cpu pin am5 socket shouldnt pin either took cloth alcohol started rubbing socket took second realize socket small pin yeah many bent lol tried bend position hour mainboards dead lol
didnt make mistake building one drop entire 1100 euro saving brand new spanky pc pc world 2016 thought fkn gpu instead intel graphic hadnt sausage left bought use cpu render feckin intel graphic 8 month gaming could save gtx 1060 build
classic connecting hdmi motherboard instead gpu
think must bad dvi cable pc wouldnt boot reseated every component tried different ram spent good 6hrs trying figure kick used hdmi cable everything booted right back day didnt even need monitor hooked pc boot
friend got new component new computer mom installed everything worked fine heard metallic ping sound inside computer started smelling like something burning didnt secure cpu cooler properly popped brand new thunderbird cpu got fried think 13 something time idea
biggest mistake ended buying 800 watt brand psu im thinking think brand powerup power amd athlon x2 5000 black edition 9600 gt mostly sale tiger directs psu calculator recommended much wattage also cheaped motherboard ended getting biostar board around 50 ended problem part retrospect probably gotten lower wattage psu reputable brand higher quality motherboard motherboard ended failing around 69 month id turn pc would appear start fan running light picture would appear screen ended replacing board foxconn recommended friend friend werent aware terrible working condition foxconn time 2008 otherwise probably would gone something else foxconn board never quit though psu hand minor problem could turned much bigger problem hadnt noticed year half originally building system reached desk behind pc try blindly plug usb cable instead finding usb port hand grazed metal exhaust fan grate psu top mounted fan grate hot nearly burnt finger recoiled pain turn fan psu burnt none heat dissipated could turned pc used small hot plate wanted hot could done serious cooking thing fan grille little tech savvy experienced time probably could replaced fan inside psu hearing potential capacitor discharge opted replace psu entirety thing seriously fire hazard im probably lucky none capacitor exploded pc didnt catch fire ended replacing ultra lsp650 worked fine dont think made major mistake friend built pc helped put everything together definitely helped definitely wouldnt installed standoff otherwise
first forgot tighten screw cpu cooler took 3 second popped buy new cpu
ive built hundred one thing almost always happens forget actually plug wall isnt shit bluetooth yet cmon man
spent like 2 hour super late night trying figure pc wasnt posting checked everything unplugged replugged cable removed replaced ram different configuration find simply never seating ram completely even though little tab lock would get pushed felt like going insane posted perfectly realized
hmmmmm two stand one way back 35 harddrives ran ide cord put cord wrong could life figure harddrive wouldnt show lol took last week went build havent opened since 2021 cleaning thermal pastei never heard backplate come cpu cooler got put back wouldnt screw sat hour realized backplate must dropped
1 forgot io shield 2 getting 8gb ram week later ordered extra stick 16gb total 3 aware existence splitter cable mobo two fan connector 3fan case one fan work 4 stock wraith spire cooler came r5 1600 could get 3 4 screw left way 5 didnt push ram way wouldnt boot correctly 6 even remotely consider cable management case time corsair carbide great value heavy however cable management option abysmal finagle lot wouldnt touching part today case great cable management wild think
one gpu cable wasnt plugged psu completely kept crashing thought driver issue
didnt properly install ram took rebuilding whole thing figure
recently bent cpu pin ram wasnt working
removed jumper thinking packing protection 12
installed window legacy instead uefi never bothered change still running install 7 year later lol
building computer decade thing psu switch every time lol
well bent pin power 6 pin gpu ignored also really bad cheap psu never gon na
removed thermal paste heat sink toasted setup rather quickly
simply reading instruction little wire power reset switch go putting random spot wondering wouldnt power
forgot take plastic sticker cooler copper plate
soldered diode wrong way round building zx81 realised cut leg
first experience literally 1 month ago honestly pretty good ran couple problem 1 accessory screw dont come accessory box side come separate accessory box hidden fucking hard drive cage psu area took 1 hour find another 15 hour get fucking box could start 2 bought radiator aio tall top case managed squeeze anyway im happy idea wire squeezing murdered hand though def isnt prettiest run
first time modifying prebuilt new gpu new ram new psu first forgot plug cpu power cable psu forgot install ram take heat sink repaste second time vc friend conversation went something like maybe ram issue dunno lem lookoh ram issue issue ram isnt ah thatll
first time forgot stand offs lmao
happened second pc build freaking system wouldnt post finished recently remounted aio twice led error code light pointed cpu ram issue already tried reseating ram time started panicking thinking new mobo messed cpu appeared perfectly fine inspected also wondered weird issue m2 drive checked fine eventually say maybe ram even though stick lighting originally inserted reseated ram stick night lighting wasnt great tried looking thing daytime could see inside better thats could finally see wasnt getting bottom end ram stick fully seated socket reseated pushed harder made sure heard click bottom timeand worked suffice say felt like idiot lol
dropping tiny screw inside case disappearedafter total dismantle entire pc realised landed almost impossibly inside psuit got stuck thereyikes take apart remove good thankfullytook day tho dropping tiny screw note taking apart psu isnt recommended everyone due risk shock note2 dont drop tiny screw near open case
rig would show image monitor would turn would turn failed notice tiny switch motherboard next ram flipped didnt remember reading switch manual flipped thinking ive tried everything else pc worked great
letting mate said know he help
shoved ram stick wrong way damaged connector instantly damaged thrown directly trash luckily mobo fine
built first pc corsair 7000d didnt take glass door working open adhesive keep attached hinge weakened enough glass panel came
day ago accidentally used cpu cable old psu frying mobo couldnt figure would boot one cpu power rail
couldnt figure damn hard screw m2 ssd screw kept popping ssd wasnt way
oh mine assembled nice machine time ryzen 3600 radeon 5700xt refused boot drove nut figured id blown cpu bought another good motherboard worked fine cheap low end amd cpu built graphic middle covid getting stuff slow month radeon 5700xt need 700 watt power supply obviously read supplied manual
funny enough zero trouble pc past thanks dad knowledge building computer recently bought part new pc asked father help nostalgia since know worked 20 year ago im kinda ignorant point put cpu strong uncaring manner think wasnt really enjoying thing tried get soon possible noticed sooner would told ill thought ok still bit surprised turned pc ok time became worried cpu heating 100c game idle ended time many attempt resolve go see specialist shop cpu bent pin like 45 buy new cpu one doomed never told dad fault though think done alone bother want buy new pc want go without building part think best
everything said also ram passive aggressive pop every damn time
built pc back 2003 didnt install motherboard standoff huge oof
didnt plug cpu power first time tried turn pc everything else went smoothly
back og titan came 2 sli decided ultrachad watercool top line x79 rig everything went well running great stupid as decided try turn one fitting get bitspower logo right side running 3000 drain huge mess clean
got ta tie first second build first build boot drive small didnt update driver anything using 4 year second build spent 2 hour turning computer last night get thru window install prompt every time turned red mobo light im 99 certain need flash updated bios itll smooth egg
return motherboard put protective plastic cover protects cpu pin am5 mobo inside retention bracket proceeded latch took bit force totally smooshed pin socket put back box returned best buy full refund shameless

built carpet dont worry 2nd better bed
ive actually made lot pc building mistake building first pc even year since already experience taking pc especially laptop apart reassembling stage watch lot tech youtubers building first pc well prepared however understand install io shield correctly leading shoving somehow port inaccessible take pc apart month later fix mistake though
back day integrated io absolutely completed couple build forgetting install io shield
cheaped power supply ended upgrading graphic card couldnt run anything bc psu weak learned lesson hard way thankfully long pc safety feature would shut instead dangerous problem
buying amd gpu
hard say count first pc first one built scratch wasnt forgot standoff thankfully plugged felt something finally realized motherboard definitely supposed fitting like thats realized standoff mind many year ago pentium 4 system top line time
second pc owned first built screwed striker 2 mobo directly case stand screw switched fizzed like fly zapper weird thing worked fine q6600 chip loved decent overclock friend still look back pc unintentional mutation pc 25 year ago shit
first time guy stopped
still havent installed io shield current build ive two year ive building 20 year
yep first machine ever built scratch 14 really proud day later wouldnt power took local computer supply shop guy flipped psu power switch pushed machine back idea switch even
already mb screwed heatsink thermal pasted power connection realizedshit forgot stupid plate
ive built dozen computer laptop repair smd replacement etc last month upgrading home server done move closer tv setupuse movie spent 15 minute trying figure keyboard worked mouse didnt never plugged mouse back moving
good thing motherboard come io installed nowadays
still get flashback back parent coming home playing pc allowed used pull plug turn quickly
forgot io plate still without lmao
yupp luckily installed gpu cooler yet noticed large shiny part box hole yupp freaked wouldnt boot doubble checked everything triple check psu
used one many switch psui switched 220 110 volt bang
never forgot psu switch never remembered io shield
lian li case got case connector one cable
forgot cpu power second build friend house cpu light thought sol good 30 minute didnt make mistake past 8 year lol
forgetting plug cpu taking like 3 hour step step watching tutorial apparently still missed step sub take long solve haha
hyte case
year ago psu came 4pin cpu power connector motherboard 8pin cpu power slot since didnt match didnt connect system didnt boot panicked half hour trying different thing decided actually rtfm saw mention 4pin connector put onto 8pin specific spot worked instantly
new antec case amazing
ive giving 45 month since june 2022 3080 ending coming june always paid time fortunately
got lucky 0 interest payment amazon 18k 3090ti
apr
could worse could payment plan something like pizza
nothing comment combination 1995 texas bold fucking standoff conjured waco raid yes know actually 93 strongly mind confused comment wasnt anything
around time 20 year ago thing idea wrong back thing lot random eventually work pc building still isnt easy day nightmare people got boot first attempt
ha first build 14 year old dx4x100 exact problem thing beast compared 386x25 time
look mr fancy pant dip switch
building since 90 case sharp easy short board put little washer standoff case mine dual voodoo card forgot put cable
486 1995 thats prime penrtium era
struggle real still fingertip andor fingerprint still lol
radiator fan blowing toward fin one day troubleshooting high temp found reason gigantic dust cake caused p
eh guess people know whats meant stock cooler cpu came without cooler thing stock cooler cpu know semantics there people read thing assume stock cooler stock cooler stock cooler get trouble sometimes read thing like stock cooler intel cpu adequate
miss day going bios disabling com parallel port used order cut irq conflict still occasionally assign irqs manually
couldnt figure 5600x hit 95 arctic freezer 360 idle
luckily remembered fully clipped tower fan though
30 year ago harddisk sticker spindle head motor lock colleage forgot remove killed disk
theyre little mentioned thing mess build
luckily realized missed something mb wasnt quite fitting dont get almost nobody mention standoff watched building tutorial week even buying part one ever mentioned anything standoff
right 14 saved buy everything got home instantly got work seemed feel like eternity went power flashed shut killed whole vibe took week figure died little week finally found bag extra screw week later asked friend beside never spoke took like hr remove mobo installed standoff put everything back together heart racing hit power button seemed like age saw first post amount joy excitement unreal
similar didnt realize tomahawk rgb switch spent money get corsair icue hub conversion cable saw switch mobo went unplug pin
save money another 10 month buy new stuff oof sorry dude long time wait replace model give little upgrade
air always blow towards side extra plastic completely open side suck
fan embossed spin direction air direction rather hard find doubt connect 12v ground see air go youre checking high powered delta fan keep finger away 200 cfm beast double carrot slicer
mistake making colour coded orange black limited choice part increased budget 400
yeah ive built 2 pc 8 year honestly havent problem reuse gpu upgraded previously pulled put new pc realised plastic film
ill never forget zap memory feel like happened super slow motion dont know actually happened exactly like exaggeration retrieving data old build kind molex ide hdd paired idecompatible motherboard trying get file sata hdd paired sata motherboard may ide cddvd drive third involved time process flash drive werent quite large yet 100gb external usb backup ran like 130 basically two tower three cord running back forth trying get old machine running ide cddvd drive sata hdd ide hdd etc thought power enough plug molex ide hdd second molex touched hdd molex pin saw giant bright white orb memory size quarter vividly remember orb falling seemed like lowgravity mode disappearing point motherboard speaker started blaring alarmsiren tiniest whisp smoke vapor dissipated eye nothing melted somehow hdd file fine wasnt start idiocy recovery cant remember quite exactly clearly hadnt learned software side thing cutting corner also somehow messed boot sector think formatted one hdds window hdds separate window installs learned restore mbr
always got rid worse bottom barrel tier e psu got jpac 500w psu nice looking case psu felt light empty opened looked like 10 worth radio shack part used make people complained psu often failed even exploded dont think around anymore
700 mhz
similar issue last build using evga clc aio cooler didnt know 12 pin connector getting power whole unit thing instant temp spike cpu also checked make sure wasnt sticker cooler plate looked instruction didnt delve deep enough apparently saw cable didnt think needed thought mobo didnt right connector aio got power everything gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
instruction manual though guilty lazy read friend computer ran 4 year think ram wrong slot
speccy friend forget spec time
every time finish building press front panel power nothing happens gasp oh
ive reached day age io plate attached mobo
last two build havent io shield installed
3 5 time open computer forget flip back
every time lol
think reason didnt forget last time built mobo cause yeah
im pretty sure never installed mine since idea one inluded lmao
motherboard company make first item box plate big piece paper say hey dumbass install first
everything screwed plugged motherboard etc tried put plate realized needed go first remembered ten year ago buddy built first pc got end picked io plate asked thing strange look quickly answered oh dont need understand lmao
dont know people act like forgetting io shield kind irreversible mistake remove expansion card unscrew mobo lift slightly place shield take 5 minute dont need worry redoing heatsink fact make convenient handle lifting board
built new pc ten year game shocked find case thermaltake tower 300 way one cable really live future
lian li wonderful case feature like theyre great couple stinker year overall great
newer corsair one 2500x singular cable io
yeah payment plan really big deal long dont pay penny interest
ah nothing like 299 curry pc world im pretty irresponsible money changing job paid didnt help best part card 3080 ti end 2022
klarna allowed deliveroo worst decision anyone could made
damn remember watching raid unfold tv thinking damn really happening
hate break 20 year ago 2005
one thing tell thoughthose part durable af short problem delicate shit deal today
5600 usually ran 5060c idle would ramp high 70 80 basically anything year later decided reseat tower saw sticker
100 go watch building video none even mentioned vital part process
standoff everyone else
happy hear work end 13 year old self wasnt lucky took apart reread manual found fault asked friend try swap hardware determine could salvaged mobo wouldnt anything cpu cpu wouldnt work mobo despite socketchipset year saving every penny burned instant crushing intro building
tell coworkers need test device psu first make sure doesnt turn
awaiting selfflippable psu switch save u moron petrifying second
searching box released pre installed mb lol
might new mb design build 2 pc year dont io shield 1 asus 1 msi
reason io shield attached mobo
except 45 month 36 month 1620 thats quite bit interest
299 fuck finish military basic training finance dodge charger well
dude 299 interest gpu pretty irresponsible
1995 eternity ago 2005 like couple year back 2063 wake tomorrow wont surprised
ugh eldest car day pointed car liked e90 bmw talked realized e90 20 year old told much said wan na see 20 year old bmw looked like age showed pic e30 think died little day
thing sit motherboard screwing case theyre insulated actual metal standoff surrounding area insulated mobo must screwed standoff case
backfire psu selfturns youre installing 2000 nvidia gpu poof got 2000 paper weight prefer unplug anyway leave power cord across front case remember plug
ha didnt bother math since claimed pay time guess minimum payment whole way thru
sound like prevent electrical short circuit bonus give motherboard little room breath circulate air standoff screw provided case manufacturer
yeah able math save money thats rich education
yes day come pre installed make sure standoff touch motherboard location except one screw mount mobo case
true jfc tho 1600 something isnt even 4080 super higher gpu maker best fucking customer
actively try dismantle public education love poorly educated
price difference isnt much yet 6950xt much faster enough power connector decent psu go 6950xt hand
psu make model cpu
6950xt great card got mine new 479 october last year sale disappointed there huge difference two id go 6950xt
quiet pure 850w gold ryzen 5 7600x3d
6950xt way
want validation buy 7800xt ask straight people love card lol
mean intels battlemage account excellent lowmid range set card ive seen expecting
7800xt must 500 euro 500 good price say bought one sapphire 470
impossible know pricing 9070 xt ready likely faster 7800xt access fsr4 big deal
probably 9070 look sweet pretty close release said im happy 7800xt itll last year
wait apu die
wanted wait pulled trigger 7800 xt couldnt wait anymore god know price amd gon na put 7800 xt best value gpu cant go wrong
working computer would buy cpu use
7800xt good deal point view 500eur example im playing i7 9700k16gb ddr4radeon 6900xt im able play hogwarts legacy everything high without rt 4k60fps fsr quality running like charm visible framedrops hogsmeade like everyone im also playing last u everything high without rt without fsr 4k60fps frame gen rock solid 60fps smooth considering 7800xt giving performance 6900xt youll good year issue play high ultra tweak little bit fsr fg
bought 7800xt nitro 5 day ago im happy decision getting new gen msrp hard youll probably neeed wait month like im hyped 7800xt amazing card 1440p say go
buy used 3060 12gbs 150200 2070s
go upgraded 7800xt sapphire pulse 1660s recently happy performance 1440p 9000 card release march run issue supply scaplers another half year becomes purchasable reasonable price
paid 500 7800 xt dont want risk losing scalper paying extra tariff im thrilled great card mean nice upgrade wife
old gone lot generation launch observation always dumbass leading launch explaining much gusto heshe waiting launch new generation buy old generation pricebreak logic look sound always look sound mean ebay right need understand really going card manufacturer making old gen last minute stopped making old gen higher edition card ago swapped new stuff playing game stock want stock depleted right launch idea walk bestbuy get discounted 4070 cause want deplete stock something nvidia amd actively trying avoid meanwhile trick think happening people replacing last year card year card selling discount never go way go ebay look price bit never completly understood truth undeniable discount want isnt really meanwhile store shelf scalper grabbing inventory quickly find advice gpu buying isnt really hard figure want look mfsrp use budget put money away dont touch ready pounce see patient might wait
7800xt amazing card
7800xt im happy get perfect 1440p amd zero driver issue unlike nvidia insert video linus giving middle finger however wait think next gen radeons seem like considerable enough jump
love 7800xt obviously meant high end ray tracing dont even turn rt time 1440p 120fps vast majority game doesnt even flinch price cant go wrong ever
wouldnt get 7800xt one great card new gen amd significantly better worth waiting nvidia 5070ti also intriguing move towards ai could pay big time lame duck cant wait try nvidia geforce 2 month cost barely anything fun try choose new gen leisure comparison review without feeling pressure
used 6900xt less
got mine yesterday im sk happy think use case im gon na notice difference new 9070 series
still hope 9070xt good card bring balance graphic card market dont want wait case flop go 7800xt still great card
bad idea new gen amd gpus almost literally already term store stockpiled arent allowed buy yet release 5 week away every indication theyll lot performant current gen plus youll access fsr4 youve waited long whats another month bit wait
spending 500 card doesnt support ml based super resolution 2025 age well really wait 9070 cant afford upcoming 5070 ti
wait month bit
id get used 4070ti super new 5070 budget dlss4 way good amd struggling compete dlss 2
b580 one downside far know thats scalped hell find one 300 buck get enjoy
get amazon get 30 day return like amd announces
thats good part whole thing good know beloved card thanks
im pretty happy somehow entire year since got could sworn 4 month price least waiting wouldnt helped
7900xtx
dont play well lowmid range cpu
thing may changed last heard significant overhead problem older low end cpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7g
need newgood cpu
least shipping portugal 500 best find saphire one find 600 actually place
565 amazon
holding since november however bought brother 6750xt almost 2 year ago price never gone go bit remains stable starting feel going 6 month without main pc end buying card could bought november exactly price
risky wait imo trump tariff pricing 9070 gon na inflated
problem saw thread everyone say coincidence booted ubuntu system get specific work done decided dist upgrade upgraded rebooted never came back life pc turn second show red light cpu turn try different apu bought 3200g second hand 30 euro testing boot ok
considering 5700x3d although already bit expensive first considered pulling trigger
portugal terrible second hand stuff everyone think something precious worth around 56 buying new even looking european ebay rarely see something 10 new worth hassle tbh
thank much observation greatly appreciated
im primarily seeing lot 3xxx card sale seems like lot people replacing 5xxx card anticipating good deal ive seen couple 3070tis 325
new gen amd significantly better worth waiting know without real benchmark price point
current price leak pretty bleak though there scalping dont think get hand 9070 5 week even willing throw 900 wanted
9070 supposed come 900 sure cut bit price doubt talking similar price range
sure theory even wait 3 year get whatever would get next month cheaper sarcastic exactly struggle constantly b een delaying decision cause always next gen next intel driver fix black friday wait gen
5070 650 euro saw second hand market pretty bad appreciate feedback though big wave pro7800xt first hour big wave people nice perspective
plus low performance lower end cpu
amd killed 6000 7000 series go
spend 500 friend recently got one 370
id say anything absolute best suffer somewhat
pretty sure gn dispelled myth
cpu
500 fine price paid 560 mine back jan last year regret love little beast gpu run everything throw 1440p easily paired ryzen 7600 popular combination two pair perfectly
motherboard
sound like life portugal doesnt matter
presume reset bios know pain retest unlikely cpu would fry software
upgraded exact combo couple month back work amazing 1440p go worry upgrading couple year
would good combo gaming 5600x would okay thats afford assume am4 motherboard already
really unfortunate honestly sorry hear eastern europe people selling 900 series gtx card 250 u equivalent possible card shipped purchased u seller break importation law
pricing leak leak especially ignored theyre likely wrong often part bc changed last minute official release past say 900 maybe itll likely itll way cheaper well wait week see scalping open q much seems like scalper focus limited supply nvidia card well see
doesnt really matter anymore nvidia priced 5070 ti 750 amd price 9070 xt 700 mean 9070 would 600
difference 6 week 6 month though
come fps visual quality dlss4 give 2540 higher fps visual quality equivalent native even better sometimes amd cant compete theyre far behind 910 gamers choose nvidia
httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophp12gbgigabytegeforcertx4070windforceocaktivpcie40x16retail1489368html 550 4070 5070 similarly priced
know cheapest seen 489 past month looking
yeah insane seeing b580 lose performance 5700x3d despite cpu holding back much powerful 4080 super
gn admission tested fairly limited suite compared hardware unboxed
steve clear result invalidate people conclusion showed effect disappears high resolution crank every setting max hardware unboxed ran test configuration much closer someone tight budget would actually play game
yap puzzled review seeing driver overhead post expected worst normal seems like damage battlemages reputation done matter misguided reviewer intentional foul play
b580 b570 lose performance paired low endmid cpu defeat whole point entry level gpu httpsyoutubebujsnbvyxvasic9qioxn4ef4hcq3 httpsyoutubecyojr3masi0ylke7xcatndmonh
apu died buying new cpu
b450 tomhawk max
would prevent boot regardless cpu cause boot 3200g 5700g checked firmware version case ubuntu done something crazy version greatly appreciate feedback btw thanks lot
yeah trying maximize am4 board 32gb ram already decent ssd plus since 3200g side testing problem like future could always move gpu new build newer chipset leave current build 3200g kid utility build kind thing
youd usually pay tax top 23 total cost including shipping 225 thats 63 extra top
facebook marketplace edit people downvoting think used gpus bad lmao
also interesting 5700x3d faster 7600x gaming overall 7600x experienced significantly less intel driver overhead necessarily surprising still noteworthy
pure cope vendetta hardware unboxed loved card initially vram price performance came gn also said result got dont invalidate reviewer point issue bad higher resolution setting youre realistically gon na entry level graphic card
youre spending 500 gpu ill guess youll get decent cpu wouldnt worry cpu issue still exist
hard say thing bit mysterious without knowing exactly go people possible know there new cpu reset parameter mystery really cpu shouldnt usually able fry like software o shouldnt changing anything bios usually
yeah make sense
could find 2070s better around price point someone u able willing ship could good deal youve got money buy new imo id get 7800xt wait another couple month amd drop 9000 series along hopefully new cuda frame work best luck man
guess youre getting downvoted fb marketplace reliable source everyone cant guarantee want especially youre major metropolitan area possible scammer deal unsure condition card probably warranty also stating friend got one 370 without also stating got used bit apple orange
probably extra memory bandwith ddr5
isnt basically everything am4 affected though op would buy motherboard ram
definitely give shot report back work find way remotely buy beer everyone saying coincidence maybe dist upgrade pushed dying cpu edge 3yo 1 week cpu never pushed hard though find odd yes thats 1 week warranty expired talk coincidence thank
op replied info
dont think apple orange comparison used pc part absolutely fine one thread said wanted new one youre budget id always try get hand used part except psu storage even big box store like best buy microcenter recommended lot available everywhere
try open third slot case first hole smal pcie slot
get 5080 line upgrade cpu yes overkill time upgrade whole system catch
course applies last genrtx 4000 would think decade old hardware would new one
u go 40 50 u upgrade part compulsorily need upgrade ur cpu ur mobo u go 40 series u make 850w psu even tho thats enough 50 series well would recommend getting 1000 w atleast coming gpu 50804080 70 40 series job almost always depends u looking wouldnt recommend spending much 5090 unless u really actual use case u go 4090 instead personal recommendation pricebest performance 4070ti
buy unknown gpu older model tested speak wait 50 series approved still would go older gpu better value money
5080 fine 1440p max setting 4k reduced setting
4070 5070 unless youre trying get 4k id say 5080 overkill
5070 ti might something look vram 4080 5080 performance cost less look like good card
depends game want play want play game bit older 7900xtx want play game releasing future would get 4080 super 5080
people disappointed 50 series expected kind miraculous new performance benchmark instead performance 40 series equal price core count want powerful stuff thats 50 series youre upgrading 10 series pretty much anything huge upgrade nevermind raytracing thats becoming requirement
considering fact youre still old hardware mean upgrade per decade said go highest end stuff afford
nvidia geforce rtx 5080 best gpu get unless go crazy rtx 5090 earth hear rtx 5080 would substantial upgrade thats crazy going 1070 5080 probably 4x5x multiplier maybe even rtx 5080 definitely recommended route go im running rtx 4070 ti super dont much reason upgrade money issue absolutely would go 5080 5090 latest generation nvidia tensor core 5000 series massive improvement 4000 series lot people dont take account evaluating performance difference one important factor
get best gpu fit budget need
amd rx 6800 average 350400 dont say budget pair nicely cpu got
kind gpu pretty severely limited old cpu likely wont get high fps remotely modern game id consider cpu upgrade along gpu likely gon na skyrocket upgrade cost new cpu mean new motherboard new ram least 5080 pretty high end card going 1070 even 40704070ti super better would significant upgrade
4090 ti budget isnt problem option go team red keep getting competitive price
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build im
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
1440p max setting overkill 2080 run game 1440p high setting 40705070 would better option
ive already got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d 5090 abit budget
6800 xt good card dont know ops budget feel bit silly pair best gaming cpu market 2 generation old midhigh end card
100 get 7800xt wouldnt spend 350 500 6800
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
set congratulation mate wish enough money upgrade like
yea thats good pairing pair am5 mobo amd expo ram u good u waiting 50 series stock might well wait ryzens new line processor eye 9950x3d
depends high many fps want
whatever best thats next 5080 amd want wait whatever else
perform worse actually
well youre pretty much set monster lol
thanks year making fair
nothttpscdnmoscmsfuturecdnnet3buqtn5dzgqi7zl8xs4wulpng also better upscaling framegen capability ai accelerator 6800 xt
think im worried future proof card 16gb vram cant afford 5090
5080 thinking 4080 super 1015 according leak last long long time mate 16gb vram sure couldve 20 24 peace mind thats nvidias segmentation 16gb still gon na fine 1440p even 4k least year vram capacity becoming important nowadays bad people make yet
okay ryzen 7 9800x3d 5080 future proof good
4090 5090 powerful setup could currently build yeah pretty much
okay thanks think wanted clarification
assuming youre playing least 1440p gpu bottleneck large majority time 12900k 9900x would perform similarly reason 12900k doesnt double amount thread core core pcores performance core two thread per core ecores efficiency core one thread per core would still go 9900x though since consumes less power platform receive least one generation cpu future
using pc anything gaming
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19html efficiency core 12900k dont anything gaming plus beyond 8 performance core there littleno benefit sometimes even detrimental due ccdchiplet design am5 cpu
gaming would still recommend going am5 7700x 9700x plenty 7600x3d would also good alternative arent thread always 2x multiple core 12900x 16 24 normally yes intel changed architecture performance efficiency core efficiency core dont multithreading 8 p core 2 8 e core 24 latest generation core ultra doesnt multithreading
yeah 1440p im gaming say platform supported one gen youre talking am5 supported one round cpu correct benefit would able upgrade cpu one gen requiring new motherboard somewhat subscribe upgrade philosophy build new system entirely 56 year future proofing isnt huge concern mine thanks bunch detailed response
yeah also workstation pc also play cpu intensive game like city skyline football manager cs2 intensive still cpu bound game thats im leaning towards i9ryzen 9 7
interesting gamingwise basically 8 core 16 thread
thanks reply breakdown p core e core included original post itll also workstation pc game play cpu intensive like city skyline football manager etc im leaning towards 9 7
lot game dont 8 core
pretty much unless lot multitasking video editingrendering
yup least foreseeable future perhaps 35 year game better optimized use core unlikely well see major way year next gen console release
here nice website see gpu spec httpswwwtechpowerupcomgpuspecsasrockrx6700xtchallengerdocb9189 try looking card lenght limit case comparing lenght shown site hope help
found right version case right version gpu case fit 310mm gpu gpu mentioned 269mm yesbut got right case gpu

thanks man
done thanks
used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly
aib model 5090s avoid whatever reason pay asus tax
got sparkle intel arc a310 eco tforce vulcan 25 inch ssd know powerful stuff play league legend pc want 144fps stuff get know pci 4 slot card resizable bar needed
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax v2 decent enough motherboard ryzen 5 7600x 64gb ram
im thinking getting new pc upgrading current one something ive never done spec need find current pc share see would better video card one know sure need radeon rx 580
want bench test cpu motherboard ram make sure component work wait gpu without installing cpu cooler im going sff cooler block ram would repaste cpu replace ram end issue ram
hey live israel gpu market kinda expensive rtx 4070 ti super go like 1165 store sapphire rx 7600 xt 16gb go 455 asrock amd radeon rx 6700 xt challenger pro 12gb oc much would guy pay gpu second hand get around 200250 good deal considering price listed
5080 review start coming
thing dustproof build build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible
game dev would recommend going amd card higher vram nvidia card lower vram nvidia card really expensive tough choice
hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
got 9700x rest build cant find video card save life right looking 4070 super something close around 600 good holdover card play something like fortnite 1440p reasonable framerate wait something become available
im currently running 5600 rx6600 650w psu full tower case going lan party pain im thinking swapping itx case thats backpack size concern psu according pcpartpicker rig consume around 260w go 300w 400w flex psu
would better get 750w psu 12vhpwr connector 1000w psu without one im probably going get 4070 super 5070
im new pc building build found sub im interested 7600 rx7800xt cost 1000 question much downgrade bit choose like cheaper gpu still able easily play modern game smoothly keep saving make build build httpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42klhttpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42kl sorry dumb question
likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup
embargo lifted launch day thursday
thing dustproof build make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect
thing dustproof build best get case easy remove toolless panel tray filter pop run fawcet leave dry pop right back often couple week youll avoid worst still get layer dust inside eventually component fan blade frame youll clean recommend looking fractal design case since usually nice filter decent brand nowadays offer
amd gpu decent game development rgamedevhttpswwwredditcomrgamedevcomments15auicgisanamdgpudecentforgamedevelopment here helpful thread provide good insight
part yeah part distinct piece puzzle fit work take old part motherboard put new motherboard profit real concern storage window install window gotten pretty good detecting new hardware like new motherboard configuring existing install perfect back data continuing case process go bad reformat reinstall o may also run window activation issue youre oem license since thats tied old motherboard ive luck calling microsoft telling youve swapped motherboards due old one dying theyll hook code fix install activated microsoft accountlinked key fix sign back
used 3070
anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough
400w sure 300 way close computer power usage
id argue would want wiggle room future expandability id also argue going small enough mandate flexatx unit difficult build occasional lan party might need go small look option like coolermaster nr200p deepcool ch160 fractal design terra take cheaper flexible sfx psus case might backpackable definitely fit duffel bag alongside peripheral ask know
gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan
thanks friendo hoping hear assumed would work puzzle wanted make sure wouldnt shenanigan m2 popped new mobo mainly keep concern mind booting hope dont reformat reinstall end day really steam game biggie
4060 290 perhaps
window right click task bar open task manager click detail button open info go performance tab able get info
dust filter going completely prevent dust getting caking fan airflow would terrible
name emphasis custom p spend shitton money contract someone help thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan fan access air thats push airflow eventually get dust finer dust filter less dust fan worse airflow coarser dust filter dust fan better airflow lian li new case lancool somethingorother cant remember numerical designation came last year button jiggle front fan quickly try dislodge dust honestly practical solution pick case like mentioned filter easy removeclean fan nice accessible
terrible feel like better option
ok thank seems like easy way deal dust

buying 4090 month launch msrp perhaps greatest purchasing decision ive ever made

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna
review vr performance seems good bump 4090 general
lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user
would liked seen review 5080 im sure hell paying 5090 5080 would consider
anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality
optimistic 5070ti card going look like without 4x fake frame cheesing
5080 benchmark yet
im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause
theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090

sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying

im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090

thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come

yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem

believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus

well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram

3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote

yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

use fake frame lock base frame pay 2000 card hmmmm would stay 3000 series use loseless scaling need cap thing u add fake frame 4rd party software maybe add 8 per frame convince u bigger better v
mean fact come locked annoying already benchmark dropping nearly 100 watt cut performance 6 overall would make look worse 4090 keep power category annoying trend across industry
cope supposed new gen price jump gon na massive aibs looking 2300
one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

offer waitlists time upgrade im new buying thing impossible get msrp

ive looked video showing performance gain versus insane power draw increase 90 imma wist till 6000s definite
fuck source basically non existent launch true even bot left disappointed
got tip best ive always bought second hand
month sound like lot difficulty
remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid
even 580s sli era 500 2 2010 voodoo tnt pre 2000 iirc sub 300 card dropped lower tier card much cheaper tv tuner version expensive always wanted one lol

dunno edited showing correctly
interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

4070 super 10 cuda core 5070 5090 review showing basically 30 faster 4090 30 cuda core could really slower

note test done 5090which significantly vram needed class gamingand 5080which arguably less vram gaming vram one factor likely influence performance dont enough pcie bandwidth id still guess pcie 40 16x 5080 wont problem wouldnt use 5090 proof
w
find let know please rocking 2080 super real need upgrade maybe superti variant come would like purchase msrp im patient person waiting couple month doesnt bother
2070s checking upgraded 219 1440p beginning struggle 5800x3d fine im thinking upgrade im beginning turn setting game medium low
restocked holding card x amount time dont purchase within window lose place line want retailer wipe as whine semantics
test peaked 697 watt nut
much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
possibly wouldnt pay kind money used gpu warranty history melting connector
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment
could use appwebsite called hotstock app give notification youre interested back stock website youve chosen watch
maybe straight nvidia site thats covid shortage got waitlist 3060 ti took like 7 month got one msrp dont see anything site though otherwise id link

lol got fe 4080s around price week back
almost seems like know 24gb 5080ti coming bet sits price point 4090 doesnt make sense massive vram gap
problem 5080 looking 200 4080 super canada
want good advertised sold 23 frame manufactured looking good hope wrong
ill sell mine
going want 5090 cant afford
update 4090
1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
sure a6000 48gb 7300
coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation
ps5 pro frame generation insertion seen aidriven technology extend strictly upscaling project amethyst discussed fg amd backing high end gpu segment said moving focus back mainstream market place amd hope maintaining decent earnings issue plagued current generation top end offering misunderstand concern around machine learning ai im worried happening supplanting traditional rendering method im worried people going see gain 5090 4090 assume lower tiered card going similar raster rt gain likely nvidia pushed review 5080 far possiblelet 5090 review drop early 5070ti isnt even thing right want mindset cemented average buyer blackwell big jump ada well evidence contrary start appearing hell think dlss fsr4 finally get gamechanging technology come supplementing raw compute required traditional rendering method 6 year ago garbage 20series poorly received rt seen gimmick top poor priceperf improvement
still confused 15 core equates 1 performance yes core scaling isnt linear thats point comparison improvement raster rt core minimal 40series going seeing big gain last gen across stack 5070 seems particularly awkward spot guess well find 5080 disappoints couple day though
netflix running idea show sadly itll banger get cancelled two season

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month
midlate ampere thing lovelace went right back early ampere add cartout stock
bestbuy doesnt offer waitlist notify come stock nothing pleasant email come already botted
great give time save money evga wait list 3090 worked well enough
discord channel good
feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

cant speak bb actually going use 40 series bh literally send confirmation email option get signed biweekly update say still list whatevs eventually get email saying restocked like 24 hour something actually buy card lose spot oem manufacturer well dont post notify link actual launch got 2040 series card evga asus bh still dont believe dont know tell
wow didnt realize 3080 ti could actually bogged mean 3060 ti struggle minecraft 4k shaders without shaders could run 8k still nail 60 fps probably already impressed xd might build machine 3080 ti point cuz like 30 series overall except 3050 nobody like 3050 good doesnt deserve anything hate get 4080 super good alternative youre looking upgrade one gen go 50 series
got got alienware 3225qf ive got 4k 240hz looking build new system 5090 might alley currently 5 year old rig 2080 super
wasnt talking pushpull setup rather fan blow air across card lengthwise rather card youd need fairly thick card make work 2slot card would limit tiny 40mm fan 3 4 slot many card already could use 6080mm fan move lot air much lower speed would aided natural fronttoback airflow many tower case already
true 2000 financed inflation negligible 5 inflation 24 month thats 200 buying 2k gpu 200 doesnt mean much
ahh thats pity scalper win
bh got hope nothing dont retailer actual waitlist id verification something way people could actually get fair timeframe

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement
never said observation needed pump core count power limit get kind increase previously one neither node shrink clear dealing significantly improved raster rt core last gen put card closely aligned spec weird spot
miss evga best havent personally heard direct sale notification queue im sure anyone intel wed like know im signed whatever get feel like im mostly going bet farm snagging launch minute pick notification never helped back 30 series fiasco
commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin
im restrospect shouldve shelled little bit 4090 cest la vie got enjoy powerful card rarely found wanting almost 3 year
genuinely relevant career youre making enough get ai workstation better yet private rack somewhere way prolevel card two thats stretch dont really need learn ai career there really lot edge case dont fall one two group
im nerd want im sure much use something like 5090 diy ai vast majority model likely going train run fine whatever right truly big boy stuff wont anything less data center small window want run train something big easier rent resource plus youd unable use machine anything else daysweeks
look like 3090 founder going 750900ish kinda range ebay moment id probably look local buyer kinda range though friend who 2070 super melted recently he making due brother old 1080 ti favor like watch dog free sometimes ill probably offer friend discount first especially since paid 500

honestly unless near microcenter timeability potentially camp launch wouldnt bother would set many waitlistnotifications possible wait patiently first card thats available rip evga best
understand sound like correctly however take active second step original comment stand make sense productive cash repayment
well dont laptop skus show kind scaling time could keep power limit core theyd clock lower
honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
use 28 4k work great
27 1440p sweet spot reason
went 32 va 1440p 28 ip 4k didnt like ended selling 32 returning 28 buying 3x 1440p 27 ip work gaming 4070s 5080 id go 32 4k 500

recently went gtx1060 1080p 27 4080s 1440p aw3423dwf tell difference staggering figured setup provide solid frame rate aaa title easily 5 year 34 monitor really nice afraid would big think really end perfect could easily afford 40905090 4k monitor 4k oled monitor choice still bit limited size option ultimately think 34 oled monitor 1440 make better overall experience 27 even 4k plus youll get fps 1440 machine wont require upgrade soon
4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful

im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price

27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor

golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate

wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp

waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent

fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah
deleted
one sir
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
length arm
op specifically mentiones point whole upgrade gaming would recommend something general use work never asked

nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
there thing future proof either help
2 day ago gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet

last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked

make feel better despite knowing full well parent aio 2008 technically didnt meet requirement window 11 spent whole day trying shoehorn anyways knew possible get around requirement done try toil trying different method prepare install medium happened upon obscure bit information newest win 11 build dropped sse41 requires sse42 unfortunately t5850 core dual doesnt supportunderstand sse42 instruction physically impossible run win 11 core dual system thorough clean repaste throwing cheap ssd perfectly usable win 10
solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case

ohhhh
ive definitely done

10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even

indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine

sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
buy better psu
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
put way psu doesnt 0 rpm mode case 7 fan sat desk sit recording vocal mixing music dont notice picked recording good psu doesnt need 0 rpm already near silent sound like buddy bad noisy one youve tuned fan quiet moving enough air psu getting hot revving cool try raising rpm case fan little psu slows find happy medium isnt one probably noisy psu
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
see lot people saying 0rpm doesnt matter youre gaming headphone thats point 0rpm mode youre gaming psu going running fan regardless pc idling im task doesnt require headphone dont want distracted psu fan going crazy
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
yes reduces price
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
hope company never stop release psus gpus without 0rpm mode want fan last longer wear faster constant startstop bullshit pain as replace
super flower leadex vii 1300w zero rpm feature toggled onoff switch
company still sell cheaper psus lower quality part would great without airflow yes cut cost hopefully saving passed consumer another way saying buying expensive isnt buying quality overpriced crap
cant even hear psu fan running small amount airflow increase reliability
love loud fan pc way know working
simple answer people buy
even pretty cheap psu probably doesnt go 0 rpm basically silent im playing game dont see huge reason
feel need make sure hear computer something wrong little bit fan noise bad annoying
replaced 16 year old ultra x3 psu died one cheaper quiet psus doesnt 0rpm mode kneel beside cant tell apart cpu case fan
mine silent mode dont bother using time hear pc fan get going anyway rog thor 1000w iirc want know
ive turned every evga power supply ive owned annoying hear fan suddenly ramp settle second unit temp threshold cycle
certainly dont care dont use pc without headphone anyways
see lot tinnitus candidate thread good guy constant weeeeeeeeee hear keep company grow older
silent say 7 noctua 3000 rpm fan case controlled fan expert dont care noise play headset anyway
im worried psu lasting long
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
yeah noise something worry especially since either something playing tv phone wear headphone becomes background noise bit anyways
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
play game watch video
fair opinion feel like people dont see way
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
exactly people talking like headphone solution everything well everyone us headphone watch hd movie surround sound system mine wife watch loud distracting noise coming computer would take u movie ruin experience
ok know say common experience fan kick power supply pull watt start heat say oversized 1200watt platinum evga power supply doesnt start fun even game full load system marginally get 600watt bought psu need different current set utilised benefit never kicking fan
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
installed corsair rm850x shift year ago ive never heard even run passively 30 40 load spin quietly havent heard yet buy quality model cheaper one
also fan constantly running gather much dust
doesnt affect something must wrong classic response ive hearing pc community decade
impossible still get pretty quiet overspend cooling accept performance penalty recent build 4070ti r9 7900 people would say completely inaudible even full gaming load
like dog people leave tv radio
like confidently wrong power supply eco mode fact looking 3 pc right eco mode fan turn psu hot enough require fan spin big enough psu get fan never spin never asked enough power heat sufficiently kick fan yes know might impact efficient sweet spot psu matter power consumption airflow always required system dissipating enough heat ksit natural convection threadripper system 3080 evga platinum 1200watt psu even gaming load doesnt kick fan doesnt even reach 50 psu rating load
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
game pc reliably isnt max length hdmi cable
pc produce little noise regular operation could easily made even quieter wished aio run needlessly high idle fan speed counter ramping noise fan make major temp fluctuation wanted could make pc even quieter due boosting behaviour 7800x3d fan actually loudest ramping higher speed chip may boost beyond 70c couple second even mundane task setting low fan speed light work would still cause random spike noise leaving reasonably low level prevents excess noise could make seperate fan curve use really needed pc quieter simply choose
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
could often tell tv turned different room apparently one knew could hear
love confidently replied actually reading wrote never said fan wouldnt spin said active component generate heat heat might passively dissipated low power consumption 0 rpm said psu start heat start spin fan guess youve never heard pc silent winter cold room become rb211 hot day load
say
could run ac unit keep room cold like server room
optical hdmi cable go even 300 foot
active cable thunderbolt depends far away put use regular cable side wall linuss current method us usb fiber box probably good option ive used thunderbolt 3 great work big pain doesnt recently converted main pc vm host thunderbolt didnt want play nice plenty option usb display cable huge length
young hear wouldnt call screeching though white noise
im obsessed oc low temp couple year aggressuve fan curve started drive mad let component reach high 60 case feel like theyre kinda hot people daily running 80c friend mine using 1050ti 90c around 10h per day rendering gaming lasted 6 year guess got ta stop obsessed also tend overshare fucking lot coul tell lmao
hit belt
cant hear anymore either got ta grow someday
im rocking asrock b650e steel legend complaint
go pcpartpicker com use make sure everything compatible motherboards specifically lookup review board youre interested tend good advice like hardware unboxed motherboard review
x870 tomahawk lane sharing plain simple
b650 b650e fine
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax 9800x3d 64 gig cl30 ram fantastic b650 board would work fine cost way less
m2 ssds pcie 40 50
money objection x870e taichi otherwise b850 livemixer b650 gaming plus
4080s 9800x3d cant afford high end motherboard x670e x870e lane
gigabyte x870 gaming wifi6 wifi7 pcie gen 5 m2 slot gen 5 x16 slot gpu good bluetooth wifi great io built 2 build friend 9800x3d work like charm edit 3 ssds dont notice performance dip dont know much lane issue
went asrock x870e nova avoid lane sharing also generally well regarded
im wrong x670e tomahawk shouldnt lane sharing issue regarded fairly decent motherboard asrock b650e riptide
asus rog crosshair x670e gene
cpugpu think ram causing issue here build httpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vfhttpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vf
asrock released b850 line picked riptide delivery today
get decent looking mid range board dont need anything crazy b650 chipset probably fine
asrock x870 riptide lane sharing us killer lan doesnt realtek lan issue reported x870 board decent price little expensive budget board going break bank either also support 9800x3d straight box bios flashback needed
went asrock x870 riptide good hardware unboxed made video x870 board
am5 board right im mistaken upgrade path leading 9800x3d pretty long asrock b650 pg lightning work
b650ee issue far
gigabyte 850 ai top
get cheapest b650 motherboard 3 m2 port thats like asrock b650m pro r something 5090 loses 1 going pcie 5 x16 pcie 4 x16 1 enabling ray tracing exact performance 2 pcie generation unless move thousand terabyte daily ssds pcie 3 4 5 wont ever see feel difference dont complicate thing dont spend hype marketing
b850 pro r wifi pretty much perfect board
im using asrock taichi lite x870e
right ended going b850 steel legend there excel sheet somewhere around reddit updated mobos spec kinda helpful helping pick one
avoid asus would go asrock right value feature
avoid gigabyte lineup shared pcie lane think x870 tomahawk doesnt share gpu pcie lane m2 slot used search msi website find specific model interested look manual reference
doesnt cpu decide many lane
asus b650ee fine setup despite people say 4080 super run full pcle 40 x16 speed youll enough lane m2 drive make sure put fastest ssd top slot want absolutely sure extra cash x670e board offer pcle 50 lane probably overkill people
ive got asrock b650 none steel legend complaint either yes ive got pcie 5 support gpu ssd 1
put 3 m2 ssds problem without cutting speed
good choice mobo good hard find stock
ive seen people suggesting avoid gigabyte asus motherboards whats issue curiosity
dont worry dont need use ssd slot
motherboard manufacturer chooses lane wired pcie 5 board wanted pcie 5 m2 slot one slot share lane gpu slot lane gpu get 16 lane unless certain m2 filled case get 8 lane 8 used m2 instead board gpu mean top pcie slot doesnt share lane anything else board manufacturer also chooses lane come cpu chipset except top pcie slot always use cpu lane since thats defacto gpu slot
u cant m22 cut usb 40 gig port half disable want full speed m2 m23 take pcie slot expansion slot equipped m24 isnt pcie 5
people hugely overrestimate big difference lane sharing make mostly game pcie 5 board difference x16 x8 lane 01 matter storage go
problem
true newegg seems getting constant stock recently got mine need get app tell stock jump oni
asus think rma everything honor duty fix problem
people say avoid gigabyte
sorry didnt mean say gigabyte lol sorry typed way fast
nice know im america already running steel legend
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
ressell really good cpu
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache
would say keep new processor upgrade mobo ram especially since likely upgrade sometime road anyways point youd getting cpu mobo ram new processor better plus youll getting better ram youll see difference sure later would upgrading cpu anyways focus solely cpu maybe gou point youll 2 upgrade already way thing would really highly recommend mobo make sure memory clock speed high enough enable expo mobos ive seen support like 4500mhz ram also make sure mobo good vrm 8500g 65 watt cpu problem finding anything handle mainly later get new cpu say got mobo right vrm handle 105 watt cpu want put 120 watt cpu need upgrade mobo worth extra buck make sure mobo good enough future upgrade
deleted
pretty sure ops post mention 8500g 5600 non x arguing want make sure youre comparing correct product change much op considering going am5 anyway would cheap way always get actual cpu upgrade later
personal opinion dataset back claim 8600g newer architecture improved single multithreaded performance integrated graphic 760m isnt something sneeze everyday light 1080p perfect personally use 5600g htpc id upgrade 8600geventually higher clock speed pcie 50 support 5600x lower price 50 cheaper neck wood larger l3 cache thing op would need ram mobo go budget itll cost much am5 am4and advantage able upgrade path future
passmark 8500g slightly faster single corehttpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare4811vs5841amdryzen55600vsamdryzen58500g come wash gaming got lighter cache wouldnt completely replatform accommodate op want move smaller system used b550ib550m board would play sell 8500g fund swap
way sold cpu many people message wild posted 10 buck cheaper others gone instantly got free list decent price someone take super fast upgraded 5800x3dwas order 5700x3d 219 found 5800x3d 250 locally used amazing doubled fps tarkov absolutely love massive massive upgrade good probably skip am5 im giving kid year building itx 9800x3d5080 build son hasnt begging pc he good fucking kid truly deserves would completely skip am5
client wanted probably
received wrong package amazon told keep free
yeah sell nib 8600g throw money much faster anything simply doesnt make sense selling point igpu doesnt need
pcie 50 support 8000g processor pcie 40 support 8 lane top pcie slot 8500g 4 lane even limited hybrid zen 4c design
deleted
straight game numbersyes isnt op spend time sell 8600g know someone buy far easier likely he going sell online present whole number issue annoyance telling op build new pc dead platform 5600x upgrade path dumb
read ordered mac motherboard received cpu didnt order cpu
never said build anything said worth building whole new rig around 8600g discernable improvement worth time hassle side grade
op isnt building pc dead platform read anything said am4 build super easy sell cpu posted mine fb week ago 50 people message woke thr guy bought messaged legit less 5 min posted esp decent deal free post cheaper use money get 5700x3d gaming 5900x whatever budget building entire new am5 build working am4 build low end cpu stupid lol using money 5700x3d 5900x even 5950x used would way better upgrade
am5 little reason use ddr56000 cl30 memory yes 7500f enough general gaming relative budget
ive managed i52500k since 2013 upgraded ssd gtx 1060 3gb ram guess id manage 7500f better go corsair vengeance ddr5 6000 mhz 32 gt cl40 80 used wondering future proofing would sense make go powerful cpu see ill manage get new one 5 year
future proofing spending spend even later unless getting x3d cpu isnt much advantage better am5 cpu unless want core even gaming performance isnt much different simply put want ddr56000 cl30 possible cl40 wont lose much performance though
experience ddr5 4800 mhz finicky term motherboard compatibility return 6000 mhz kit bought common respected brand buy 4800 mhz kit found manufacturer compatibility list wouldnt really sweat difference much
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
6000 cl30 ddr5
6700 xt 6750 xt find one either 7600 xt b580
b580 competition find one msrp
intel arc b580 competition ups budget get awesome card
6750xt 6700xt b580 7600xt order best best haha
planning using
stretch bit rx 6750 xt 360390 euro best youll get price range
3080 ebay
cant find b580 retail b570 also seems perform really well think change drastic doesnt really matter get
sell 8 gb stick put two 16 gb stick
sell memory buy pair best way possible dual mode may deactivated timing set safe slow work rare case wont start
guarantee run 3200 bought another stick 3200 mixing memory always increase chance doesnt work expected would run flex mode would 8gb8gb running dual channel remaining 8gb would run single channel 16gb memory needed imo unless need capacity likely going result situation
recommendation new 2x16 set replace get new 2x16 3200 ddr4 set 50 unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably dont use timing case way either motherboard try figure youre customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip youd make sure pretty thorough stability test
gpu might worth trying boot integrated graphic assume boot drive showing bios
reset bios unplugging psu either shorting cmos pin 10 second hitting button motherboard second removing cmos battery 30 second
tried fresh install window get another boot drive test existing boot drive rule corrupt o
long let attempt boot window cpuramboot led debug light lighting memory training am5 take first boot talking minute ten minute
possible something happened boot expo file corrupted try boot install medium see reset way
yes boot drive showing bios actually already dont gpu pc yet im going try 50 series day assembled rest pc yesterday make sure everything working
unfortunately ive done 10 time bring bios reset default setting trying boot still hang black screen
dont think window issue booted window fine yesterday used pc little enabling expo get back
let run 20 minute instance earlier attempt yellow light come resetting cmos reinstalling ram made go away
look restore memory context thing change auto enabled fresh window install may worth seeing cant boot usb install medium reinstall also update bios possible thing would try
even without enabling expo made sure trying boot base 4800mts ram speed
id check boot sequence see stage boot process get past always accurate help point fails boot im sure yellow light mean particular motherboard sound strange booting anymore even resetting cmos back default
yes fresh window install also updated bios yesterday beforehand im already latest version restoring memory context
yes ive hit disable expo bios well manually chosen 4800mt clock speed way boot anymore
httpswwwredditcomramdsdzoxrivizi look thread found see may possibly help pretty old would thought updated bios would rule hey never know uh yea would personally try see even boot usb window install medium least troubleshooting reinstalling window could fix issue would eliminate headache
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
yes window drive first boot order actually able boot window use computer earlier since enabling expo everything got messed debug led none
see youve tried either stick time tried slot worst thing think possibly hardware issue either cpu fully socketed one ram channel dead even ram issue
im pretty sure everyone forgets psu switch io plate first time
forgot connect cpu power tried troubleshoot entire day gave sent part back forgot case pwr button cable god sake 30 year still dont easy standardized 1 connector case pin

taking tiny little sticker bottom cpu cooler
standoff totally didnt know thing fan blipped first time powering could never get mobo cpu work
spent 2 hour wondering new build wouldnt post bios sketchy moniter cord wrong connection faulty mb etc driving insane nearly wanted post help google post sub well classic mistake youd think ram fully seated first time nope reseated booted bios
mobo came integrated io big first time mistake avoided conveniently rested wire back fan io hole safe keeping installed mobo realised wire still hanging though mobo squashing remove mobo reinstall took age first time around
back 2010 built first pc took 57 hour forgot thermal paste cpu
build first pc around 2016 help experienced friend pc build boot signal nothing check everything connected properly yep think ended giving troubleshooting almost 2 hour obviously secondary part lying around test took local pc repair shop next day troubleshootingdiagnostics charge around 15 eur 40 minute hour later swapping cpu gpu multiple ram kit etc testing improvement decided take motherboard component case try hooking another known working psu last resort still dice said motherboard must doa send replacement upon starting unplug psu cable suddenly started mumbling fuck fucking kidding appearantly forgot plug cpu 8pin power cable didnt notice neither upon inspection routed connector motherboard never connected connected connected powersupply cable pc booted immediately pc still working order day since year half new mobo power supply one friend current gaming pc old mobo gave shortly moving new friend place didnt charge 15 eur service fee since took almost hour max 5 min check fix slight win since ive build bunch pc acquired lot knowledge past 9 year point build troubleshoot pc eye closed friend family also side hustle earn extra cash number 1 instant check still see cpu power cable connected properly also say havent occasional little moment stress pc wasnt turning realising forgot switch power supply
first build actually went without hitch funny thing latest cpumobo upgrade last year rgb wouldnt work fan drove crazy verge making 3 hour drive microcenter returning everything eureka moment next morning work stupid as forgot plug everything rgb header done countless build without issue dumb oversight lol
first time bios war assumption twice voltage twice performance spoiler went good
bent pin massive understatement haha looong time ago like 2004 finally saved enough money upgrade ancient pc didnt know buddy said build pc problem came helped put cpu socket athlon 64 3000 everything fine tried mount cooler wouldnt fit anyway tried push twist somehow nothing time trying lifted cooler magic cpu socket yeah turned cpu sticked cooler tried force place many way brushed cpu pin across socket almost half pin bent like hell also couple broken also managed kill motherboard save money another 10 month buy new stuff back 2020 build new system without gpu impossible get one finally got 3070 two month later excited ala turned wont fit pcie slot doesnt tried like 15 minute even put lot force nothing sad figured either faulty gpu maybe damaged transport faulty motherboard broken pcie something went put gpu box send back thats realized gpu still plastic cover pcie connector
didnt put mobo standoff cut io shield
cable tie anything could use cable management also didnt screwdriver forgot order thermal paste started put thing together also lack usb stick could install window wifi driver
plugged usb hub bios usb port hell broke loose every time upgrade build run b wasnt used paying attention
life connect fan right direction know plug motherboard think im stupid honestly
first time tried build pc found one company build pc buy individual component vague idea much wanted purchase part concept actually needed make computer work computer arrived wouldnt turn call company rep told power supply purchased wasnt big enough pc return pc part upgraded complained power supply wasnt big enough didnt someone contact sending power supply knew wasnt big enough part available purchase set wasnt big enough explained knew little pc building assumed part list provided adequate long story short got full refund brother law help build ordering amazon newegg let suggest part would work together feel like thing really wrong enough research picking part also feel like said truth part picker build computer thats whole thing building pc scratch niche warning power supply insufficient said took rep word
nothing really thats honest also everything kind worked
helped friend order part build pc college part arrived friday heading home weekend told could build together monday well got little impatient threw together managed get everything put together went turn zap yeah forgot standoff felt bad guy lol
thought gpu shoddy kept plugging monitor igpu
first build last time upgraded gpu cpu fan went well wouldnt boot window troubleshooted everything could think realized stick ram wasnt fully pressed place pressed heard click immediately started laughing
sure mistake pretty sure oh well put cpu cooler first time wasnt well put together remove put lost track cpu turn stuck cooler xd guess didnt secure cpu socket well enough
ive built dozen pc still starting built brother pc everything going well pressed button little spark pop smoke started coming case turn forgot plug cpu plug motherboard thankfully mobo fried everything else good got replacement day later first last time ive ever seen pc go flame lol
friend make first build call one simple issue motherboard old bios version yet support cpu work sit read manual flash bios usb stick without cpu manufacturer worst case find older cpu get bios update
didnt select boot drive couldnt life figure red light mobo
buying gpu facebook marketplace doesnt work
afraid bricked something static find havent connected power cable gpu
propperly seating cpu cooler 34 screw 4th one couldnt screw dont know decided 3 wouldnt cause much trouble left like month later replaced one amd stock coller one cooler master
shit psu came case
used old external hdd family picture window know worked 12 let say mom wasnt happy gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
issue building pc first time screw ssd nvme2 samsung one box mobo seem one either disaster good 30min untill decided watch bunch unboxing building pc video mobo realised small screw different small package promotion manual page mobo box would legit find ever
spending 500 ssd ram instead vram gpu
dumbest mistake building budget pc ended spending 2x much upgrading time saved little first got quality component right bat
didnt connect front panel switching pc touching pin metal touched motherboard z270 realeased burned
buying 80387 coprocessor chip go along 80386 cpu really need math coprocessor time 80386 would plenty
added graphic card thought purpose display bought cheapest card could hdmi using tv time hd 6670 quickly replaced
built first pc 2011 loved always felt better jump forward 2020 big tear reinstall noticed switch mb normally meant overlocking basically stunted cpu couldnt cook turn nine year 37ghz cpu operating max 07
connected external cooling fan wrong connector started pc rgbs fan popped fan still work quarter fan light permanently dark blue color
plugging psu cable installing case man fiddly
first powered pc aios kraken elite screen didnt turn thought cause needed download software something powered pc temp spiked nearly immediately trying debug pushed power cable pump little bit screen turned turn even powered cause connector loose
brother building first pc would turn dont know brother tough maybe switch psu help switched 220 v 110 v magic smoke discovered live europe got 220 v face expecting 110 time cheap
usb didnt use header block individual pin hooked one wrong im way booted literally caught fire burned usb header still worked otherwise though
first one built brother dont count built one month ago display took mc ram slot 3 4 v 2 4 hell know
got case fan side panel happened align directly air cooler remove fan entirely pointless gotten first place also immediately forgetting hardware turned worked instantly dumped information head fast forward 7 8 year idea could run modern game didnt know check
somehow killed 8700 bought 13900k
mistake ive seen vga cable inserted monitor jack screwed upsidedown coworker impressive strength first build case didnt come standoff couldnt find preweb google figured important something case mobo assembled pc layer foam conductive foam mobo shipped friend took repair shop never told outcome probably didnt want embarrass
forgot gpu clamp existed trying reseat gpu yanked entire slot motherboard luckily 2 equivalent slot plugged second one several year random pin sticking motherboard
buddy bent cpu pin like 3 hour straightening got work guess random weirdness pc guess attribute cpu pin bending suspect could something else good story try nitpick didnt bother trying give tech support haha
early 2000s component purchased online newegg afraid breaking something applying much force seating heatsink cpu ended sort resting top hit power heard pop watched soul cpu floated away small puff smoke think rmad half build question asked newegg awesome back day
taking apart clean prebuilt ended extra cable doesnt turn
spent extra bought 900w psu gon na cross fire 7970 ghz edition year use squeeze life cross fire sli got dropped never got
forced usb c cord motherboard upside gifemotefreeemotespackflipout
day thought broke pin cpu installation learn cpu never pin
well recent build spent hour troubleshooting display driver reseating gpu cleaning port etc second monitor would get picture matter hard tried turn bad displayport cable
got first pc december couple week ago bought pair presonus eris 35bt speaker great sounded great nice loud jamming guitar like week ago suddenly started stuttering lot couldnt figure searched tried many thing nothing worked thing changed recently installed fan hub pc also got set steelseries arctic wireless headphone figured headphone maybe interfering something know solution work pc installing fan hub unplugging everything removed wifi antenna figured use ethernet dont need idea also needed bluetooth screwed antenna back speaker work perfectly
build yesterday miswired power button connection nothing powering keyboard lighting knew mobo getting power overconfident dummy initially built inside case took everything built mobo box realized error take apart back case output monitor another 45min troubleshooting saw monitor power cable wasnt plugged thankful issue indeed user error
pulling 500w 500w supply never exploded probably single digit amount watt sounded like lawnmower heavy gaming seshes
20 year ago child pulled pentium 4 socket cooler thought could push back never saw much bend pin trusty hairdryer flathead screwdriver able fix never bend pin since
way back 2000when wasnt rgb glass side panel built computer forgot connect fan cpu air cooler computer worked perfectly fine one day opened cleaning 6 7 month later saw fan connected soon computer boot youd get thermal alert throttling minute
went mobo doesnt wifi bluetooth built regret decision
helped coworker troubleshoot first build cuz issue found screwed mobo straight case without using standoff
didnt consider cable management space selected case made build 10x frustrating needed
got obsessed looking sale deal probably spent month researching different component searching best value pc totally fine last 10 year couple gpu upgrade along way probably wasnt worth spending much time researching signing deal alert save 200 buck total
long ago would sell case power supply remember janky diablotek psu blow didnt know better kid enjoying first custom build extremely fortunate didnt take component sure smelled like burnt electronics idea diagnosed issue something eventually told buy new psu sure enough hooking everything pc alive
forgot plug power button everything perfect except power button panicked good 10 minute trying figure wouldnt work felt like total genius
plugging power button probably also least forgot plug power cable cpu
0 cable management first build
installed cooler bracket way wasnt able secure peerless assassin forgot plug 24 pin panicked pc wasnt turning
got shitty case bad airflow r5 3600 1080ti sweating bullet inside please spare headache get mesh front intake case side size least 2 120mm fan
forgot take little bracket installing cooler left tiniest gap cpu didnt notice thing would shut 15 second luckily found problem quickly haha
motherboard doesnt support usb3 front panel connector usb2 front panel usb lol
futureproofing build ended upgrade cpu gpu mobo later
installed cpu cooler fan blowing away heatsink took figure cpu ran hot even idle
noctua cpu fan stuck case allowed couldnt close glass pane properly 1 tb space ran within 4 game properly quality control check monitor found dead pixelsback light bleeding return exchange use xmp profile ram stick
biggest regret trying build low budget gave 600 dollar thought would enough build something could least run game wanted fast forward around year already cant run stalker 2 basically unreal engine 5 game struggle really hard
forgot io plate forgot remove cpu sticker remembered quickly due multitude image using modular psu used wrong psu port videocard cable
ensuring pushed am4 cpu fully mobo taking repaste installing cooler shitting wouldnt boot
first pc build recent one power button seamlessly integrated case design literally didnt see mashing rgb light button wondering wouldnt power triple checked connection reseated everything looked diagram case make sure header plugged right noticed power button thought
plugged pc case power button fan wrong haha couldnt start pc wondering read manual mobo
getting prebuilt instead custom
buying mobo cpu compatible
everyone forgets psu switch didnt forgot press power button case dont know thats better worse
tried work powered touched audio chip metal zapped use sound card lol
installed latest window 11 update shut connected android phone via usb turned pc gainward rtx 3060 fan running output sure killed rtx left preowned gt 710 cant cry enough shelled cash preowned setup
havent built pc year missed io plate forgot take cover vga port think know mean im always nervous hell cpu install managed get paste underside cpu luckily side could wipe continue surprisingly front usb always managed get one go
mean putting psu upside seems tough mess ive done least twice
bought 487 coprocessor go 386 cpu got work though socket compatible 487 returned result cpu 386 ready ended cutting motherboard trace soldering delay line timing would work
im older first time getting case fried whole thing cost 2700 fix inflation adjust dollar wore grounding strap fried another motherboard lazy early 2000s grounding cant hurt
network driver window wifi lost ethernet wasnt working still dont understand happened since window usually come generic driver
biggest mistake son made following crowd mentality watching review understanding process important still need check need could saved time money would gotten endless rabbit hole better future proof pleased built didnt realize longer path went assessed build enjoy process fun problem solving frustrating happening really appreciate solved issue know build feel lot accomplished good luck
plugging monitor motherboard hdmi instead gpu lmaooo
added gpu didnt know activate bios msi lga 775 window xp
plugging cpu power
forgot plug simply mobo power cord lol
bought wrong connector wifi instead mhf4 bought ufl connector slightly bigger pin adapter causing didnt clamp kept coming
io plate second build
back elementary school knew needed uprade graphic card play game better setting around time graphic card started sometimes additional power pin required psu went passively cooled gpu realize two type common slot gpus agpwhich pciewhich gpu well quite disappointed found
forgot remove protective film cooler wondered ran hot bit
bought part help friend done hitting buy button decided change psu much cheaper one brand probably invented make single oosu fine year buy new motherboard cpu addition psu blew spent three year much worse cpu money tight overspent fancy psu avoid issue
first pc built joy use went budget grabbing 7800x3d 9800 wasnt yet 4070tis gpu 6000mhz ram gigabyte x670 mobo fully modular power supply putting together threw monitor plugged keyboard mouse prayed screen came bios thanked god noticed temp cpu touch high started getting higher pc shut terrified thought either defective unit air cooler wasnt sufficient triple checked connection tried thing power high temp steadily rising shutoff didnt want throw power knew happening cpu cooler clearly support bracket correctly paste spreading albiet much yeah make sure check exactly cooler supposed mounted mine barely touching transferring basically heat felt like giant doofus remove plastic applied proper amount paste least shame doesnt help isnt making contact fixed temp steady around 30 celcius mark sigh relief engaged
picture 2005 online building guide website ancient helpful youtube doesnt really good tutorial yet either resource instruction manual came case motherboard manual badly translated chinese english two biggest first time mistake install standoff bracket came case instruction said nothing could figure front panel power connector manual vague go motherboard ended take shop take look able get fixed quickly showed screwed
tried add gpu dell optiplex sent gpu back working turn turn legacy rom turn secure boot bios
building first x86 amd computer 1998 believe amdk5pr75 turned computer junkie dumbest mistake money could saved
many time ive performed maintenance gaming rig forgot plug power back gpu wondered screen blank post
installed cpu cooler without removing protective sticker
plugging hdmi motherboard gpu took 40 staring blank screen wondering computer wont work
didnt get ram seated ram speckle
knowing better getting cheap psu also buying case proprietary fan connector fortunately psu hasnt blown yet im looking solving soon case fan ill give case brother whenever want build new pc
pcpartpicker selected hyte y70 instead y60 hakos bae case led liquid freezer 3 compatible ended corsair titan rx added rx fan side intake got sale worth end
chose used motherboard amazon didnt work didnt made building mistake though
didnt plug psu cable way took figure one
didnt seat ram way would start booting continue first build wound taking shop really embarrassed found
didnt seat ram way would start booting continue first build wound taking shop really embarrassed found
mounted cpu coolerfan wrong way rip whole thing already thermal paste required much force thought going destroy cpu
first build forgot plug 8 pin pci gpu couple week ago concerned done cpu psu swap concerned messed something got display mid troubleshoot saw werent plugged cable managed clip zip tie lol
needing update graphic driver way see anything
didnt plug 24pin connector way couldnt figure pc kept rebooting random interval
bought sff case cant fit fan besides aio
buying 1080 600 dollar 2021
turned pc got video audio forgot connect 8pin power gpu
wrong form factor mobo case ended without rig 2 week cuz mistake
recent build put fan backwards phantom spirit version bought different others logo side push air pushing warm air case without anything pumping noticed temp bit high fixed dropped 10 degree one thing rather proud using barbecue lighter see way air flowing
forgot 1 standoff one right gpu slot gpu didnt seat correctly pc still kinda worked unusable thing build night huge lan despite getting lot help didnt find issue hour went home pc worked flawlessly 30 minute got back home fixed issue
hdmi cable mobo even tho gpu xd
connected cpu fan pin rgb stripe motherboard close thought place wrong soon turned pc fan working frontal one 3 second died felt stupid person earth since thought fried whole computer fortunately nothing happened switched cable right place worked like charm never problem 45 year
forgot io plate forgot take blue plastic film ssd heat sink forgot standoff didnt know plug front connector name
every 3rd computer build io panel installed forgot
thanks sending memory lane trying see could remember first pc build im going guess late 80 around 10 frankensteining together old part would hoard bedroom closet instead letting dad throw away remember one early junk build paradise brand graphic card tough get working came tshirt cheesy beach graphic paradise logo dont know happened shirt regret losing track day let call first big pcbuilding mistake
ran first custom loop year sticker cpu block
fan blowing wrong direction
dont remember first time long ago get regret buying hardware first place 1 week 1 month new better gpu cpu come make mine look like toaster ive prone upgrading every 2 year less im holding ive yet made 1 year im tempted upgrade addiction
realize motherboard standoff essential component build purposely ignored thinking cosmetic thing people wanted interior look nice computer wouldnt even boot dismantle 80 build get installed
first pc build gpu wrong slot year boy feel stupid figured wonder game crashed almost constantly
building small form factor suffering get everything fit build wire zip tied place realized never plugged power switch disassembled whole computer placed cable terminal took around hour dice still turning troubleshot 3 hour went bed returned following day took apart start metering stuff discovered power button connector plugged backwards
getting voodoo 5 birthday month went business meant updated driver back actually needed updated driver even run new game community driver eventually got ati 9700 instead
plugged 5v pin 12v fortunately rgbs
used amd fx8350 save buck immediately performance issue almost every modern game crazy far amd come since
bent almost pin cpu rip pentium 4
first time building pc everything good go first boot met error slotted ram incorrectly okay problem well took hr 4am trouble shootin swapping ram pc would turn id get display tried every single ram slot variation using 1 stick everything find first swapped ram mustve slightly unplugged gpu power thats display probably started first guild midnight lol year later reddit saved another minor issue took week trouble shooting take pc repair store mouse stutter constantly tried everything new mouse pad new mouse tried old mouse different pc worked fine issue seemed pc reinstalled window driver everything could think turn mouse stutter caused slightly loose hdmi cord going 2nd monitor everything worked fine mouse funny thing didnt find reddit post talking loose hdmi cord caused mouse stutter probably would never found issue take pc repair store issue would resolved unplugging everything take pc
didnt consider size case relation size video card tight fit unscrew shift gpu cooler odd position make work basically wasnt coming back time replace made damn sure new pc issue p
went itxhttpscapcpartpickercombyx4d4d cable management hell room proper cpu cooling specific order put everything together definitely didnt follow took entire day build computer dont learn hard mode kid
actually recent second build dumbest plugged front io cable case com pin front io pin troubleshooted almost hour realizing much idiot first build mostly marred knowing much tension ram slot cpu door needed
paying attention interrupt request available motherboard comparing expansion card got everything work modem dip switch small selection interrupt none available motherboard basically incompatible understood sure schedule colonoscopy year
yep forgot standoff first time friend teaching let make mistake told wrong noticed thing werent lining forgot io shield time also forgot buy thermal paste twice run best buy time
put cpu cooler tr p 120 se wrong orientation 180 degree still seemed fit gpu though turned around regardless
making sure case right size pc part picker said would fine building could life get cpu cooler nzxt one little screen end putting cooler front case instead top cooler setup funky take panel front hut work measure twice
broke every little leg io plate didnt understand push bit motherboard better one upgrading o drive sata ssd nvme somehow installed window weirdest way possible boot part still old ssd o nvme ssd die im fucked die isnt connected exactly happened upgraded cpu recently discovered much ive fucked x
strangely mistake time tried build friend mine pc didnt check everything fitted told check forgot lol ended mounting aio rad front rather top
didnt realize hard snap ram place wound seating correctly going nut trying figure wouldnt work took two day one tech savvy friend spent hour facetime suddenly asked properly seated told lean really push heard snap sound soon presto
didnt cable manage cable sticking body case
plugging something realizing
forgot plug gpu power supply wondering computer wasnt posting like 2 hr
installed fan backward fan pulling air case found month later layer dust outside case getting pulled
would put fan slot pentium 3 whatever since cpu encased hard plastic need actively cooled luckily kept shutting didnt melt completely
didnt used spacers mobo case puff
case wasnt large enough gpu wait another week one show
well let see first time problem month ago let see took cover cpu mobo interface bent 3 pin like n00b tiny tweasers magnifying glass hour somehow missed fan slot put last one kept mobo booting thought fried cpu turn didnt plug cable first slot pretty dumb mistake
buddy completed first build wasnt able go help day got part hed gotten everything done hooking psu installing gpu head help wrap plug aaaaand nothing figure maybe dvi hdmi try cord without success even run home grab another cord long story short ram wasnt seated fully
research
initial build upgrading gpu first time ripped entire pcie slot plugged new gpu next slot surprisingly ill effect lol
realising graphic card second power plug need
plugged cable psu came without checking one actually needed installed everything tried figure everything went realized clogging thing making cable management impossible took everything started took like hour figure lol
11 shorted mobo 13 deleted window wouldnt boot hell bent bin build last year luckily bent back
plugged sata cable upside silverline psu blew hard drive
couldnt figure computer kept turning second smartphones didnt good way debugging either eventually accidentally found probing unseated part cpu burned learned cpu need cooler
friend spread thermal paste inside pc frosting cake
thought first pc broken didnt know install driver motherboard smart kid
watch build guide verge
instantly burned brand new cpu happened back early 2000 athlon64 didnt thermal damage protection whatsoever forgot properly secure cooler created tiny gap cooler cpu turned power instantly smelled burned electronics buy new cpu learned important lesson day
power supply screw wrong one friend thought friend help u demanded 200 dollar helping
immense amount paranoia building first one triple checked every move made build took damn near 11 hour worth since everything put together lasted solid 9 year counting problem mistake made minor one hit power button checked cpu fan make sure everything good noticed cpu fan barely turning immediately powered everything check connection tried turn cpu fan looked like barely rotating lighting put direct light could see fan full speed
lmao ive built thousand pc weekend almost issue power switch power bar flipped
2003 building intel northwood processor cpu required separate 4pin 12v connector power beyond 20pin atx connector provided read manual thoroughly noted completely forgot building pc would turn strain eg running neverwinter night wasted summer figuring time rmad cpu motherboard genuinely believed hardware fault
friend mine built pc helped pick part first build back 2011 dont know uncommon didnt want pay modular power supply didnt get one regretted extra cable case pain case wasnt built cable management build bluray drive moved drive lower case could shove unused cable cable slack gap top case drive second thing case year case fan would rattle one hard drive one video card issue assumed fan dying replaced still rattled id smack side case every time rattled would stop
first time went well forgot plug power connector 1070 either specific bios message insufficient power gpu figured 30 second second time hell time hand couldnt get driver including networking driver importantly work installing window 25 day later realized using window install drive 2016 old made new installation key problem went away
using 2 pcie cable daisy chaining 3080 working fine first month started display issue bought new 850w psu replace 750w psu thinking problem realize needed 3 separate pcie cable plugged learned internet coworker issue
moved cpu tad bit mounting didnt lift turned bent bunch pin mobo
forgot snap little bar lock cpu turned case upright cooler installed yet cpu plopped broke
decade ago one many standoff forgot leave one based motherboard called touching component back motherboard checked removed pc fired lasted quite long life
switched reset ground cable case causing one dont remember catch fire
cheap smart like dad sorted cheap needed play game wanted bought accordingly shit obsolete really fast lowspecgaming community bigger test buy cheap go obsolete immediately cheap expensive guy
forgot io shield didnt plug cpu power cable remembered turn power supply switch though forgot turn outlet wall couldnt figure wouldnt boot
letting 2 friend help knew everything came together fast fast forward 10 year realized idea confident set aside lot less time needed super easy right hand learn either way big deal
would light output time assumed bad motherboard got replacement im pretty sure didnt push ram far enough first one lol 100 like least 70
thought mine broken cause flipped psu switch nothing happened keyboard turning got ta hit power button mb dur
got intel cpu instead amd
first pc long time ago probably setting jumper correctly irq drive master slave set course didnt start building system spending year frankenstein rebuilds existing prebuilds hdd ram upgrade gained lot experience beforehand
help teacher first time built computer nothing crazy went however ago tried insocket upgrade new processor wouldnt work updated bios old processor without putting cooler upgraded platform last year put motherboard noticed would break bracket case one soldered one already put motherboard could life remove pull motherboard
window kept crashing install took 3 hour figure put 1 ram chip installing window put 2nd
forgot pull sticker part cpu cooler connects cpu wondering cpu got hot started stuttering high load fortunately fixed couple day damage yet
thought switching psu actually turning cried went bed woke realized pressed power switch powered right oh forgot click ssd place properly confused window wouldnt install gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
going mini itx didnt space constraint putting pc made difficult upgrade road due interior space constraint limited selection component
think stripping mobo screw pc case thankfully pretty inconsequential
plugging monitor io instead gpu classic streamed building twitch show friend issue
first second stupidly forgot remove protective plastic top cpu installed cooler never started computer still waiting addition part night lying bed strangest feeling fd stupidly left plastic even though knew watching many installation video got next day inspected work sure enough could see tab plastic cover sticking cooler thankfully thats dumbest thing ive done far
wouldnt post two hour troubleshooting later found ram wasnt seated way
literally built saturday booted first time patted back took look creation realised cpu cooler upside work fine upsidedown artctic logo starting bother
picked amd system
upgraded gtx 1080 3080 upgrading rig fitting wouldnt boot properly checked everything started troubleshooting concluded 3080 faulty went customer service site bought spent age chatting person online decided send back shop twice took 2 week tested said fine working properly transported rig cousin house verdict turn didnt plug 2nd psu cable 3000 series need assumed required 1 like 1080 gaming friend circle still crack joke day
choosing cool gamer case chose cool zalman z11 case turned bitch clean sidepanel fan died year
old one first pc built amd pr75 cpu upgraded cyrix p133 couldnt even install window 95 thing kept crashing install process tried going back window 31 fine everyone still using do game anyway eventually something really wanted win95 started playing around see problem discovered worked fine changed core voltage 34v instead recommended 33v still dont know operated fine 16bit software 32bit oh another old one atx form factor power switch pc used directly attached psu switch completing circuit main current flowed testing part psu removed case picked switch without noticing plastic sleeving covered bare terminal slipped flicked 240v across hand cant say enjoyed much
way back old day fancy sound werent built motherboard generic sb clone wanted connect motherboards speaker sound card hear better somehow plugged wrong wire melted smoked reading fine manual told speaker header sound card connection motherboard internal speaker
idk mistake really dumb moment haha built first pc month ago motherboard got didnt support cpu box told tried bios flash thing anything else got flash drive renamed file stuck hit button flashed like 2 second turned every video watched said would take minute scared messed tried ton thing like hour girlfriend getting upset wasting time since building pc together stopped moved fast forward first boot everything worked fine recognized cpu im still sure worked lied im relieved run amazingly
think common mistake building first pc setting jumper right wondering piece shit computer booting oh forgot set jumper
buying superdiskls120 coming completely wasted money could gotten vanta much better performance 8mb permedia ii video card landed
worst mistake made getting motherboard sata port lol
screwed motherboard directly case fair first ever time building pc obviously mistake like ever repeated though forget power switch least every time build pc
spent 2 hour trying figure light pc wasnt turning never plugged monitor
extremely sick severe mental fog excited finally build forgot motherboard spacers screwed mobo directly case smelled exactly like imagine tried fire
spending extra money motherboard pci isa slot instead getting cheaper pcionly board putting extra money toward better modem
plug cpu psu cable gpu
didnt put motherboard standoff wondering wouldnt fit lol tbf dumb reason every tutorial watched decided mention step luckily realized something wasnt right didnt force screw
wired jfp1 incredibly wrong pc would boot took pc repair shop moved connector around booted straight away issue pc 10 year
ram wrong slot go computer shop get laughed
put cheap wireless card build confused internet speed horrible turn antenna provided absolutely horrible moved router closer used different antenna good go sometimes start easiest step forgot
aio fan pulling case instead pushing lol
built first pc everything went exactly planned save fighting intels really stupid snap stud system laminar stock cooler watch video unblock one easy enough though literally thing perfect wouldnt give display everything posted everything good everything everything fact gpu wasnt plugged thought 3060 ti sli port turn port pcie power issue adding another hard drive scratching head second switched disk boot priority problem solved know enough build second pc
installing lian li tl lcd fan upside assuming werent powering defective moronic design though honestly shouldnt able connect power supply cord wrong end definitely otherwise flawless victory shau khan status first build
using shitty component
vetting brand enough even certain marketplace almost gave hobby getting burned tigerdirect thats one young one might ever heard
forgot order thermal paste ordered waited arrive found cpu cooler came preapplied thermal paste
bought cheap gpu cuz blower model didnt know gon na loud af drown audio even headphone xx always gon na get 3 fan model
20 year ago forgot use standoff completely killed motherboard cpu somehow fine less expensive lesson might
couldnt figure gpu wouldnt fit thought incompatible mobonope forgot take little pcie protective thingy
forgot plug cooler pin thought mobo failing detecting cooler
didnt know motherboard standoff actually 2nd build first pc raised motherboard mount new case didnt idea put little standoff shorted board right
rgb fan werent working correctly tried everything except software update
first 2 pc went smooth third aio plugged fan header right next cpu fan header sooooo much trouble shooting realized stupid mistake
didnt use standoff motherboard working fine couple year didnt
put 1070 pcie 1x slot couldnt figure graphic looked poor year
brother spazzing monitor wasnt working plugged hdmi mobo
forgot put standoff case couldnt understand wouldnt boot brought tech expert work figured pretty much immediately thankfully nothing fried much likely back second pc build though friend felt extra bad
starting budget build going full stupid halfway buying part twice isnt fun sound like
1st crack idea standoff frank memory little fuzzy pre2000 remember mobo would flop somehow side case shorting stuff anyways mad dumb eventually someone explained standoff b mobo flopping side case bad bad bad got eventually attempt 2 god know second crack understood idea standoff short took thing far looking standoff saw metal case metal standoff forming circuit back board went overkill making sure screw board insulated passing voltage quite kind problem shit dying inside pc cause standoff supposed offer ground static go case psu wall could write book stupid shit pre2k didnt want anywhere near stuff
forgot motherboard riser wouldnt turn like pulled board weird way figured happening lmao
oh let see bought pentium 4 clear move athlon 64 bought dual gpu motherboard didnt support sli bought inferior graphic card immediately paid much replacement best buy
didnt happen first build one time applied much thermal paste seeped onto motherboard month
one case fan plugged socket thats behind gpu know monumentally important hub back solitary little guy life head rent free
used thought plastic standoff ended breaking 6 month use 2nd pc put together spent hour trying figure wouldnt post ignorance assumed either cpu motherboard would able post bios without graphic card installed wrong
first pc built always ran really hot desk always assumed finally built new pc 4 year later forgot another year new build come back old desktop set living room open find exhaust fan came case never plugged 5 year later finally found ran hot
forgot ram ordered every single part would need except damn ram 10 year ago friend still bring fact forgot order ram clearly need better memory
computer one fan command stripped replacing part year ago lost screw something genuinely cant remember hasnt bitten yet time tell
bent cpu pin fortunately able bend back straighten plier
thought installed front header connection correctly spent 30 minute getting frustrated worried broke something thankfully easy embarrassing fix
thinking buck naked anti static strap wrist building didnt short anything second explaining wife needed buck naked kitchen carpet build
dumbest mistake upgrading cooler old am4 build bent pin 5600x damaged socket removing old air cooler knew better still managed pull feat plus side kid able upgrade build spare component plan use remaining part na
ram stick right next
back 2016 changing cpumotherboard new one somehow thought would genius set carpet floor shocked completely killed brand new board gotten lol
forgot cpu power cable
dont even remember first pc build guess mistake taking photo would well digital photo thing maybe earliest pc build remember gigantic dualpentium tower spent way much money probably around 19961997 zero recollection record built never bought premade dell gateway anything like also dont remember buying motherboard chassis separately
went reddit advice kidding course bought upgrade kit unsupported ram am5 build super unstable 5600mhz till day rocking 4800mhz
ive built one pc everything ready go two cable motherboard switched around didnt turn eventually figured glass case exploded granite tile counter
dumbest mistake made going full rgb saw robey build white lian li xl blinded color
cheaped processor got cyrix instead pentium dont ever buy fastest current cpu ill never buy slowest ever
small bean installing aio making sure psu connection made annoying
upgrade wife pc new ram graphic card went boot kept restarting didnt set ram way happens
bought triple channel build sticked ram next enabled xml 4 year latest mistake bending little metal io plate hole
accounting case size future graphic card upgrade microsoft atx great dont plan upgrading man atx case give better airflow allows flexibility graphic card
taking 4 hour lmao forgot io shield 3rd one got overconfident moved fast lol
going rgb build pretty good job may say adhd turn flashing blinking spinning light corner eye unbearably distracting even solid stationary color ended much spent fair amount turn day never use
bought case thought looked cool button top pressed make front panel slowly slide open reveal drive powerreset button really cool week slowly got sick waiting thing move broke panel next build utilitarian antec case solid airflow filter easy access io undersized build used case next three personal pc im getting rid want usbc port front panel
bad backplate mount aio wouldnt provide solid contact blockcpu temperature issue lived year thinking system ran hot aware problem denial far dumbest building mistake end getting different aio give issue
put riser wrong spot shorted mobo
accidentally bought ddr ram instead ddr2 kinda new time didnt know different
putting io shield ever lol
old psu two switch one power 2nd one eco mode turned eco mode switch trying figure pc would turn
psu somehow set 120v 240v switch back im ukdid go well
1st ever cpu motherboard dx4 cpu put cpu board didnt boot panic went actual repair shop looked turn inserted cpu wrong way everything ok tho laughed
biggest mistake ignorant extraneously testing 8tb hardrive bought amazon beforehand drive completely died long purchasing lost lot data thinking new would fine ironically new drive worry building pc fairly easy though make sure read manual come purchase youll straight
buying super expensive case time around 140 2014 pretty expansiv case time like buy 200 case today mean big nice clean think simpler one would bean ok yea know 120 case isnt much want wall mounted one one optionbrand
20 year ago powered pc find main power source motherboard wasnt plugged psu properly
sticker came amd cpu back day thick sticker come cpu right put cpu attached heatsink even lying never noticed problem cpu werent hot back
dumbest mistake made building first pc thats easy buying seagate barracuda hard drive immediately replacing despite recall list 2008s recall thinking oh theyre recall list fine joke still bricked even though werent part recall list break magically added recall list id already lost data never buy seagate product ever youve lost customer never ever buy product ever lived forever would never buy product ever
mucking cooler master 212 evo use stock intel cooler picked 212 black edition
done building started first try flat thing still box oh mr io shield well shit spent 15minutes convincing self need io shield back offk
ive ever built one pc scratch friend mine bought component afraid tackle thing messed power reset button got backwards somehow lol several minute hitting power button nothing happening eventually hit reset button hell powered right would easy fix didnt care left way early 20 pretty proud pride increased little year later guy bought stuff build way better pc instead letting put together another friend dude master degree something computer related maybe im guessing thats chose guy forgot one corner mb standoff point went install something made loud popcracking noise stopped went back installed standoff im pretty sure late im remembering correctly pc never worked right replace mb even get running doubt guy surely way knowledge came pc go show even someone master degree still make rookie mistake guess ill find still im getting ready put together son pc
20 year ago 15 16 gotten first paycheck working student job whole month july part ordered uncle going help put together come gpu wouldnt fit bought pcie card motherboard agp didnt know difference uncle didnt see everything together could go store return mom went store best angry mom ranting guy refunded card gave agp one instead thinking back gone different motherboard pcie instead first pc used couple year time upgrade since agp card longer made also overclocked hard cpu burnt motherboard end lifetime month ago found old case good memory old nzxt case basically looked like power ranger
destroyed cpu didnt understand zif socket worked snapped least dozen pin bent rest dont think single pin left untouched time done defense eight thought knew
spent like whole day troubleshooting first pc figure image realize wasnt supposed plug monitor motherboard

overspending ram faster mobo could handle overspending mobo feature never used lifetime overspending case tell upgrade ok overspend actually would sick sight time upgrade buy new one
plugging atx power mobo correctly one pin wasnt making contact felt special tech micro center pointed
first pc build hdmi cable hooked motherboard instead gpu bit mental breakdown thinking broke something realized felt dumb
built 4050 system think since 16 33 first build mistake plugged psu end cable sata hdd pcie hole zalman psu back 4 pin connector cpupcisata fried hdd glad atleast happened pc friend
didnt mount aio correctly pc would immediately shut post spent 2 hour tearing pc thinking something short feeling residual heat motherboard pcb cpu overheating finally noticed mistake building pc fun sometimes downright torture
didnt know different ram like ddr2 ddr3 bought part new computer set ddr2 ram got super excited unboxed everything started building realize ddr2 fit ddr3 ram slot wait week amazon deliver new set ddr3 ram
didnt realize motherboard cpu pin slightly bent design since got used freaked tried bending straight broke buy another one top trying use cheaper test model cpu didnt work get another original cpu
first pc one time another forgot io shield remembered io shield forgot check little metal ground finger right place sliding motherboard got caught io header bent front port blocked repurposing older motherboard new machine cleared cmos using jumper removing battery forgot move jumper back got motherboard hair tightening installing gpu display port close edge slot couldnt get video cable
didnt push ram way thought build broke friend pointed fairly teased good hour afterwards
first build pentium massive spark melt power cord giant blue flame dad watching thought bury great laugh fortunately fixed problem put new cord ran fine lately messing rgb cable bent lga pin latest faux pa
ive built whole pc without testing part beforehand broken motherboard fully unbuild system pain as
decided friend help build first pc 16 tried boot pc fan working hour trouble shooting watching video notice fucking fan literally plugged

deleting system32 got computer consequently building got hand hp pavilion started going folder thinking could delete unnecessary file rebooted bricked went best buy buy window xp install cd got fresh start whatever reason really got tinkering point since built dozen pc family friend
preparing build kept seeing dont forget flip power switch absolutely forget flip power switch psu imac 8 year one power button didnt think press button front case well built twice outside case inside took shop said couldnt find issue turned right nice build charged 100 dollar turning pc might charged less didnt realize got home
didnt fully insert ram posted unstable like installing anything troubleshooting guide said update driver first literally couldnt took 3 frustrating hour blue screen death one restarts left debug led long enough figure
forgot io plate chose massive pc case reason cable management complete garbage
really high decided assemble everything popped cpu socket forgot lock stuck heat sink fan bent every pin cpu started sliding around neighbor painting figurine massive magnifying glass fucking dude bent every pin back straight popped back finished build worked 2007 still work day
ive done first build everything fine including thermal paste point working cable order hyte y40 5 phanteks m25 gen 2 argb fan one normal one using linq6 adapter 2 argb header two fan header
didnt route power cpu power 2 internet seemed divided whether needed also realized wrong psu wire going gpu needed remove motherboard switch wire two change worked perfectly
happened third pc finished building completely including giant noctua air cpu cooler put together im ready plug forgot put io shield way get without taking air cooler redo thermal paste bent shiny thing plier fit doesnt look amazing fine dont put io plate soon dont wait youre ready actually use io
example 1 using flat head screwdriver assist attaching cpu fan clip slipped took capacitor motherboard example 2 managed put ddr3 ram backwards powered south bridge chip burned almost immediately first experience electrical fire smell like
forgot standoff motherboard fried everything 30 year ago didnt dare year tower come built standoff
everything went well actually week someone notified there plastic film inside glass panel
dumbest mistake ive made overall first build 1012 year ago absolutely destroyed usb3 header front panel heard component pushed force instead checking make sure pin lined pushed harder eventually broke probably couldve survived without front panel usb3 bought new motherboard anyway dumbest mistake made recent build plugging power button
built first pc didnt really mess anything somehow unlucky enough get bad am3 motherboard bad psu confirmed testing friend part spent 2 day troubleshooting luck got friend bring working pc test part bunch combination realized 1 part defective im glad havent bad luck since lol also upgraded current pc got ryzen 3600x friend tried install pc wouldnt boot turn cpu bent pin didnt bother check pin installing idea bent friend gave brother able unbend pin ive never removed cpu since lol
shitty power supply shorted hour installation tripped breaker 3 time barrack realized going
didnt really mess build ordered part living campus excited got delivered noticei sprinted across campus get part moment knew messed walk huge box part including pc case back dorm bear hugged box might embarked journey felt like 4hrs back room tired finally made sat everything took nap course forgot connect video card power first boot started freaking looked side glass saw obvious screw im glad didnt ruin anything shaking part went
misplacing phillips head screwdriver
building single problem month later wouldnt show image going everywhere trying troubleshoot happened combination factor actually 1 main monitor plugged broken displayport broken enough recognized broken enough make monitor go crazy blinking red green blue black white straight signal message 2 second monitor still plugged would throw message saying signal 3 order troubleshoot bought motherboard speaker would sometimes troubleshooting process throw 1 long beep 3 rapid fire beep indicating ram issue might expect together pia nothing soon unplugged dp second monitor said hi something display
bought intel cpu amd mobo luckily cousin let know could cancel lmao
scared push memory stick way tried troubleshoot month rebuilt clicked right
back day motherboards came tiny speaker diagnostic beep didnt bother putting turned pc wouldnt post without took quite figure
weirdly none
building pc guess going looooonnnggggg checklist hahahaha
pinched fan cable case port motherboard didnt notice done building done cable still fan work nothing blocked
knew monitor display cable connect directly gpu couldnt find gpu port gpu connected monitor motherboard instead obviously didnt work spent hour troubleshooting discovering gpu perfectly usable port covered socket protector apparently smarter toddler
think issue plugged monitor gpu using hdmi wouldnt display screen switch dp idea time
even building first pc last year im nearly 50 rushed i7 11700 installation boxing day wondered retention lever wasnt going way cpu wasnt properly plenty bent pin socket tried best fix tweezer bin motherboard worst bit timing wait another 2 day another board felt proper waste 100 carelessness
back day swapped p8 p9 plug spent next couple hour trying figure couldnt get signal
standoff idea supposed use got lucky learned damaging anything
flipping negative positive power switch connector mobo pc kept power cycling took hour calling buddy figure haha last weekend another build experience knew immediately
io plate first 2 remembered hard stuff easiest thingjust forgot
spent day throubleshotting pc build would turn would restart loop forever took apart several time find pin atx power supply would go way
forgot thermal paste cpu initial problem display getting recognised random shut down
gifted nice pc decided upgrade keeping motherboard 800 later nice 8 year old pc maxed also first time putting gpu tried pull back realign tore pcle slot find old used motherboard fit old spec piece
thing psu switch first build took 15 minute figure
many moon ago spent day troubleshooting new system recognizing hard drive realize hadnt setup masterslave jumper correctly
first pc recent one thought hardware issue install window 11 kept black screening midway tried reinstall window five time course afternoon trying troubleshoot myriad potential issue along way turn hdmi switch flipping channel equally pissed also relieved found dreading hardware fault
wasnt hardware issue machine turned posted first try wouldnt load bios finally said eff roll dice booted window install thumb drive fine much later finally realized problem faulty assumption machine would boot bios without keyboard input cause o board got bios ez pz
used tv monitor plugged hdmi cord mobo hdmi slot instead gpu freaked video signal oh psu switch course
tried put hdd drive interior case put mobo innicked capacitor somehow ruined big lesson learned lol
dragged case building across thick carpet bricked board cpu go back ancient pc pulled dumpster another month
first pc build screwed motherboard directly metal case rathet little metal screw riser hit powet would run 1 second short instantly power back 2004 place like youtube even existed kind winged since sell previous dell prebuilt pc get enough money build one access internet anyway want pc shop bought part showed super friendly told wrong 30 second looking shout sw electronics tucson
plugged power supply cable motherboard backwards atx improved standard couldnt
tried turn pc cpu heatsink pc would turn right away forced power fried cpu
much building part purchasing thing bought x570 mobo wish would gone b550 instead dont really get much value extra stuff x570 brings upgraded anything way thought would ram kind waste money hey work like pc dont sweat
back ide day set jumper back hard drive order detect properly well messed around completely forgot later plugged everything could get boot reinstall window drive took whole day could search problem internet
booted bios thought pc unresponsive forgot plug mouse keyboard
alright think contender mid 2000s junior high maybe technically second pc ever built first time friend helped first time im solo im super excited got everything together fire computer start smell burning turn right away try figure smell coming power supply seems ok hard drive good gpu issue smell coming cpu run dad ask help take apart although remembered thermal paste put wrong side cpu best clean cpu socket board melted bit kept around number year remind failure honestly dont know didnt fry cpu thing ran probably decade
gpu didnt fit case
tightening screw accidentally scratching motherboard trace leaving option warranty rejected buy brand new x570 gaming plus motherboard best lesson learnt thru hard miserable way still mobo work kept backup whatever happens happens reason
thinking everything would work first time
didnt know cpu needed power cable
absolute braindead moment day ago got new cpu cooler wanted clean old thermal paste cpu ryzen 7 saw dust am5 socket thought clean cpu pin am5 socket shouldnt pin either took cloth alcohol started rubbing socket took second realize socket small pin yeah many bent lol tried bend position hour mainboards dead lol
didnt make mistake building one drop entire 1100 euro saving brand new spanky pc pc world 2016 thought fkn gpu instead intel graphic hadnt sausage left bought use cpu render feckin intel graphic 8 month gaming could save gtx 1060 build
classic connecting hdmi motherboard instead gpu
think must bad dvi cable pc wouldnt boot reseated every component tried different ram spent good 6hrs trying figure kick used hdmi cable everything booted right back day didnt even need monitor hooked pc boot
friend got new component new computer mom installed everything worked fine heard metallic ping sound inside computer started smelling like something burning didnt secure cpu cooler properly popped brand new thunderbird cpu got fried think 13 something time idea
biggest mistake ended buying 800 watt brand psu im thinking think brand powerup power amd athlon x2 5000 black edition 9600 gt mostly sale tiger directs psu calculator recommended much wattage also cheaped motherboard ended getting biostar board around 50 ended problem part retrospect probably gotten lower wattage psu reputable brand higher quality motherboard motherboard ended failing around 69 month id turn pc would appear start fan running light picture would appear screen ended replacing board foxconn recommended friend friend werent aware terrible working condition foxconn time 2008 otherwise probably would gone something else foxconn board never quit though psu hand minor problem could turned much bigger problem hadnt noticed year half originally building system reached desk behind pc try blindly plug usb cable instead finding usb port hand grazed metal exhaust fan grate psu top mounted fan grate hot nearly burnt finger recoiled pain turn fan psu burnt none heat dissipated could turned pc used small hot plate wanted hot could done serious cooking thing fan grille little tech savvy experienced time probably could replaced fan inside psu hearing potential capacitor discharge opted replace psu entirety thing seriously fire hazard im probably lucky none capacitor exploded pc didnt catch fire ended replacing ultra lsp650 worked fine dont think made major mistake friend built pc helped put everything together definitely helped definitely wouldnt installed standoff otherwise
first forgot tighten screw cpu cooler took 3 second popped buy new cpu
ive built hundred one thing almost always happens forget actually plug wall isnt shit bluetooth yet cmon man
spent like 2 hour super late night trying figure pc wasnt posting checked everything unplugged replugged cable removed replaced ram different configuration find simply never seating ram completely even though little tab lock would get pushed felt like going insane posted perfectly realized
hmmmmm two stand one way back 35 harddrives ran ide cord put cord wrong could life figure harddrive wouldnt show lol took last week went build havent opened since 2021 cleaning thermal pastei never heard backplate come cpu cooler got put back wouldnt screw sat hour realized backplate must dropped
1 forgot io shield 2 getting 8gb ram week later ordered extra stick 16gb total 3 aware existence splitter cable mobo two fan connector 3fan case one fan work 4 stock wraith spire cooler came r5 1600 could get 3 4 screw left way 5 didnt push ram way wouldnt boot correctly 6 even remotely consider cable management case time corsair carbide great value heavy however cable management option abysmal finagle lot wouldnt touching part today case great cable management wild think
one gpu cable wasnt plugged psu completely kept crashing thought driver issue
didnt properly install ram took rebuilding whole thing figure
recently bent cpu pin ram wasnt working
removed jumper thinking packing protection 12
installed window legacy instead uefi never bothered change still running install 7 year later lol
building computer decade thing psu switch every time lol
well bent pin power 6 pin gpu ignored also really bad cheap psu never gon na
removed thermal paste heat sink toasted setup rather quickly
simply reading instruction little wire power reset switch go putting random spot wondering wouldnt power
forgot take plastic sticker cooler copper plate
soldered diode wrong way round building zx81 realised cut leg
first experience literally 1 month ago honestly pretty good ran couple problem 1 accessory screw dont come accessory box side come separate accessory box hidden fucking hard drive cage psu area took 1 hour find another 15 hour get fucking box could start 2 bought radiator aio tall top case managed squeeze anyway im happy idea wire squeezing murdered hand though def isnt prettiest run
first time modifying prebuilt new gpu new ram new psu first forgot plug cpu power cable psu forgot install ram take heat sink repaste second time vc friend conversation went something like maybe ram issue dunno lem lookoh ram issue issue ram isnt ah thatll
first time forgot stand offs lmao
happened second pc build freaking system wouldnt post finished recently remounted aio twice led error code light pointed cpu ram issue already tried reseating ram time started panicking thinking new mobo messed cpu appeared perfectly fine inspected also wondered weird issue m2 drive checked fine eventually say maybe ram even though stick lighting originally inserted reseated ram stick night lighting wasnt great tried looking thing daytime could see inside better thats could finally see wasnt getting bottom end ram stick fully seated socket reseated pushed harder made sure heard click bottom timeand worked suffice say felt like idiot lol
dropping tiny screw inside case disappearedafter total dismantle entire pc realised landed almost impossibly inside psuit got stuck thereyikes take apart remove good thankfullytook day tho dropping tiny screw note taking apart psu isnt recommended everyone due risk shock note2 dont drop tiny screw near open case
rig would show image monitor would turn would turn failed notice tiny switch motherboard next ram flipped didnt remember reading switch manual flipped thinking ive tried everything else pc worked great
letting mate said know he help
shoved ram stick wrong way damaged connector instantly damaged thrown directly trash luckily mobo fine
built first pc corsair 7000d didnt take glass door working open adhesive keep attached hinge weakened enough glass panel came
day ago accidentally used cpu cable old psu frying mobo couldnt figure would boot one cpu power rail
couldnt figure damn hard screw m2 ssd screw kept popping ssd wasnt way
oh mine assembled nice machine time ryzen 3600 radeon 5700xt refused boot drove nut figured id blown cpu bought another good motherboard worked fine cheap low end amd cpu built graphic middle covid getting stuff slow month radeon 5700xt need 700 watt power supply obviously read supplied manual
funny enough zero trouble pc past thanks dad knowledge building computer recently bought part new pc asked father help nostalgia since know worked 20 year ago im kinda ignorant point put cpu strong uncaring manner think wasnt really enjoying thing tried get soon possible noticed sooner would told ill thought ok still bit surprised turned pc ok time became worried cpu heating 100c game idle ended time many attempt resolve go see specialist shop cpu bent pin like 45 buy new cpu one doomed never told dad fault though think done alone bother want buy new pc want go without building part think best
everything said also ram passive aggressive pop every damn time
built pc back 2003 didnt install motherboard standoff huge oof
didnt plug cpu power first time tried turn pc everything else went smoothly
back og titan came 2 sli decided ultrachad watercool top line x79 rig everything went well running great stupid as decided try turn one fitting get bitspower logo right side running 3000 drain huge mess clean
got ta tie first second build first build boot drive small didnt update driver anything using 4 year second build spent 2 hour turning computer last night get thru window install prompt every time turned red mobo light im 99 certain need flash updated bios itll smooth egg
return motherboard put protective plastic cover protects cpu pin am5 mobo inside retention bracket proceeded latch took bit force totally smooshed pin socket put back box returned best buy full refund shameless

built carpet dont worry 2nd better bed
ive actually made lot pc building mistake building first pc even year since already experience taking pc especially laptop apart reassembling stage watch lot tech youtubers building first pc well prepared however understand install io shield correctly leading shoving somehow port inaccessible take pc apart month later fix mistake though
back day integrated io absolutely completed couple build forgetting install io shield
cheaped power supply ended upgrading graphic card couldnt run anything bc psu weak learned lesson hard way thankfully long pc safety feature would shut instead dangerous problem
buying amd gpu
hard say count first pc first one built scratch wasnt forgot standoff thankfully plugged felt something finally realized motherboard definitely supposed fitting like thats realized standoff mind many year ago pentium 4 system top line time
second pc owned first built screwed striker 2 mobo directly case stand screw switched fizzed like fly zapper weird thing worked fine q6600 chip loved decent overclock friend still look back pc unintentional mutation pc 25 year ago shit
first time guy stopped
still havent installed io shield current build ive two year ive building 20 year
yep first machine ever built scratch 14 really proud day later wouldnt power took local computer supply shop guy flipped psu power switch pushed machine back idea switch even
already mb screwed heatsink thermal pasted power connection realizedshit forgot stupid plate
ive built dozen computer laptop repair smd replacement etc last month upgrading home server done move closer tv setupuse movie spent 15 minute trying figure keyboard worked mouse didnt never plugged mouse back moving
good thing motherboard come io installed nowadays
still get flashback back parent coming home playing pc allowed used pull plug turn quickly
forgot io plate still without lmao
yupp luckily installed gpu cooler yet noticed large shiny part box hole yupp freaked wouldnt boot doubble checked everything triple check psu
used one many switch psui switched 220 110 volt bang
never forgot psu switch never remembered io shield
lian li case got case connector one cable
forgot cpu power second build friend house cpu light thought sol good 30 minute didnt make mistake past 8 year lol
forgetting plug cpu taking like 3 hour step step watching tutorial apparently still missed step sub take long solve haha
hyte case
year ago psu came 4pin cpu power connector motherboard 8pin cpu power slot since didnt match didnt connect system didnt boot panicked half hour trying different thing decided actually rtfm saw mention 4pin connector put onto 8pin specific spot worked instantly
new antec case amazing
ive giving 45 month since june 2022 3080 ending coming june always paid time fortunately
got lucky 0 interest payment amazon 18k 3090ti
apr
could worse could payment plan something like pizza
nothing comment combination 1995 texas bold fucking standoff conjured waco raid yes know actually 93 strongly mind confused comment wasnt anything
around time 20 year ago thing idea wrong back thing lot random eventually work pc building still isnt easy day nightmare people got boot first attempt
ha first build 14 year old dx4x100 exact problem thing beast compared 386x25 time
look mr fancy pant dip switch
building since 90 case sharp easy short board put little washer standoff case mine dual voodoo card forgot put cable
486 1995 thats prime penrtium era
struggle real still fingertip andor fingerprint still lol
radiator fan blowing toward fin one day troubleshooting high temp found reason gigantic dust cake caused p
eh guess people know whats meant stock cooler cpu came without cooler thing stock cooler cpu know semantics there people read thing assume stock cooler stock cooler stock cooler get trouble sometimes read thing like stock cooler intel cpu adequate
miss day going bios disabling com parallel port used order cut irq conflict still occasionally assign irqs manually
couldnt figure 5600x hit 95 arctic freezer 360 idle
luckily remembered fully clipped tower fan though
30 year ago harddisk sticker spindle head motor lock colleage forgot remove killed disk
theyre little mentioned thing mess build
luckily realized missed something mb wasnt quite fitting dont get almost nobody mention standoff watched building tutorial week even buying part one ever mentioned anything standoff
right 14 saved buy everything got home instantly got work seemed feel like eternity went power flashed shut killed whole vibe took week figure died little week finally found bag extra screw week later asked friend beside never spoke took like hr remove mobo installed standoff put everything back together heart racing hit power button seemed like age saw first post amount joy excitement unreal
similar didnt realize tomahawk rgb switch spent money get corsair icue hub conversion cable saw switch mobo went unplug pin
save money another 10 month buy new stuff oof sorry dude long time wait replace model give little upgrade
air always blow towards side extra plastic completely open side suck
fan embossed spin direction air direction rather hard find doubt connect 12v ground see air go youre checking high powered delta fan keep finger away 200 cfm beast double carrot slicer
mistake making colour coded orange black limited choice part increased budget 400
yeah ive built 2 pc 8 year honestly havent problem reuse gpu upgraded previously pulled put new pc realised plastic film
ill never forget zap memory feel like happened super slow motion dont know actually happened exactly like exaggeration retrieving data old build kind molex ide hdd paired idecompatible motherboard trying get file sata hdd paired sata motherboard may ide cddvd drive third involved time process flash drive werent quite large yet 100gb external usb backup ran like 130 basically two tower three cord running back forth trying get old machine running ide cddvd drive sata hdd ide hdd etc thought power enough plug molex ide hdd second molex touched hdd molex pin saw giant bright white orb memory size quarter vividly remember orb falling seemed like lowgravity mode disappearing point motherboard speaker started blaring alarmsiren tiniest whisp smoke vapor dissipated eye nothing melted somehow hdd file fine wasnt start idiocy recovery cant remember quite exactly clearly hadnt learned software side thing cutting corner also somehow messed boot sector think formatted one hdds window hdds separate window installs learned restore mbr
always got rid worse bottom barrel tier e psu got jpac 500w psu nice looking case psu felt light empty opened looked like 10 worth radio shack part used make people complained psu often failed even exploded dont think around anymore
700 mhz
similar issue last build using evga clc aio cooler didnt know 12 pin connector getting power whole unit thing instant temp spike cpu also checked make sure wasnt sticker cooler plate looked instruction didnt delve deep enough apparently saw cable didnt think needed thought mobo didnt right connector aio got power everything gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
instruction manual though guilty lazy read friend computer ran 4 year think ram wrong slot
speccy friend forget spec time
every time finish building press front panel power nothing happens gasp oh
ive reached day age io plate attached mobo
last two build havent io shield installed
3 5 time open computer forget flip back
every time lol
think reason didnt forget last time built mobo cause yeah
im pretty sure never installed mine since idea one inluded lmao
motherboard company make first item box plate big piece paper say hey dumbass install first
everything screwed plugged motherboard etc tried put plate realized needed go first remembered ten year ago buddy built first pc got end picked io plate asked thing strange look quickly answered oh dont need understand lmao
dont know people act like forgetting io shield kind irreversible mistake remove expansion card unscrew mobo lift slightly place shield take 5 minute dont need worry redoing heatsink fact make convenient handle lifting board
built new pc ten year game shocked find case thermaltake tower 300 way one cable really live future
lian li wonderful case feature like theyre great couple stinker year overall great
newer corsair one 2500x singular cable io
yeah payment plan really big deal long dont pay penny interest
ah nothing like 299 curry pc world im pretty irresponsible money changing job paid didnt help best part card 3080 ti end 2022
klarna allowed deliveroo worst decision anyone could made
damn remember watching raid unfold tv thinking damn really happening
hate break 20 year ago 2005
one thing tell thoughthose part durable af short problem delicate shit deal today
5600 usually ran 5060c idle would ramp high 70 80 basically anything year later decided reseat tower saw sticker
100 go watch building video none even mentioned vital part process
standoff everyone else
happy hear work end 13 year old self wasnt lucky took apart reread manual found fault asked friend try swap hardware determine could salvaged mobo wouldnt anything cpu cpu wouldnt work mobo despite socketchipset year saving every penny burned instant crushing intro building
tell coworkers need test device psu first make sure doesnt turn
awaiting selfflippable psu switch save u moron petrifying second
searching box released pre installed mb lol
might new mb design build 2 pc year dont io shield 1 asus 1 msi
reason io shield attached mobo
except 45 month 36 month 1620 thats quite bit interest
299 fuck finish military basic training finance dodge charger well
dude 299 interest gpu pretty irresponsible
1995 eternity ago 2005 like couple year back 2063 wake tomorrow wont surprised
ugh eldest car day pointed car liked e90 bmw talked realized e90 20 year old told much said wan na see 20 year old bmw looked like age showed pic e30 think died little day
thing sit motherboard screwing case theyre insulated actual metal standoff surrounding area insulated mobo must screwed standoff case
backfire psu selfturns youre installing 2000 nvidia gpu poof got 2000 paper weight prefer unplug anyway leave power cord across front case remember plug
ha didnt bother math since claimed pay time guess minimum payment whole way thru
sound like prevent electrical short circuit bonus give motherboard little room breath circulate air standoff screw provided case manufacturer
yeah able math save money thats rich education
yes day come pre installed make sure standoff touch motherboard location except one screw mount mobo case
true jfc tho 1600 something isnt even 4080 super higher gpu maker best fucking customer
actively try dismantle public education love poorly educated
price difference isnt much yet 6950xt much faster enough power connector decent psu go 6950xt hand

used 6900xt less
got mine yesterday im sk happy think use case im gon na notice difference new 9070 series
still hope 9070xt good card bring balance graphic card market dont want wait case flop go 7800xt still great card
bad idea new gen amd gpus almost literally already term store stockpiled arent allowed buy yet release 5 week away every indication theyll lot performant current gen plus youll access fsr4 youve waited long whats another month bit wait
spending 500 card doesnt support ml based super resolution 2025 age well really wait 9070 cant afford upcoming 5070 ti
wait month bit
id get used 4070ti super new 5070 budget dlss4 way good amd struggling compete dlss 2
b580 one downside far know thats scalped hell find one 300 buck get enjoy
get amazon get 30 day return like amd announces
thats good part whole thing good know beloved card thanks
im pretty happy somehow entire year since got could sworn 4 month price least waiting wouldnt helped
7900xtx
dont play well lowmid range cpu
thing may changed last heard significant overhead problem older low end cpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7g
need newgood cpu
least shipping portugal 500 best find saphire one find 600 actually place
565 amazon
holding since november however bought brother 6750xt almost 2 year ago price never gone go bit remains stable starting feel going 6 month without main pc end buying card could bought november exactly price
risky wait imo trump tariff pricing 9070 gon na inflated
problem saw thread everyone say coincidence booted ubuntu system get specific work done decided dist upgrade upgraded rebooted never came back life pc turn second show red light cpu turn try different apu bought 3200g second hand 30 euro testing boot ok
considering 5700x3d although already bit expensive first considered pulling trigger
portugal terrible second hand stuff everyone think something precious worth around 56 buying new even looking european ebay rarely see something 10 new worth hassle tbh
thank much observation greatly appreciated
im primarily seeing lot 3xxx card sale seems like lot people replacing 5xxx card anticipating good deal ive seen couple 3070tis 325
new gen amd significantly better worth waiting know without real benchmark price point
current price leak pretty bleak though there scalping dont think get hand 9070 5 week even willing throw 900 wanted
9070 supposed come 900 sure cut bit price doubt talking similar price range
sure theory even wait 3 year get whatever would get next month cheaper sarcastic exactly struggle constantly b een delaying decision cause always next gen next intel driver fix black friday wait gen
5070 650 euro saw second hand market pretty bad appreciate feedback though big wave pro7800xt first hour big wave people nice perspective
plus low performance lower end cpu
amd killed 6000 7000 series go
spend 500 friend recently got one 370
id say anything absolute best suffer somewhat
pretty sure gn dispelled myth
cpu
500 fine price paid 560 mine back jan last year regret love little beast gpu run everything throw 1440p easily paired ryzen 7600 popular combination two pair perfectly
motherboard
sound like life portugal doesnt matter
presume reset bios know pain retest unlikely cpu would fry software
upgraded exact combo couple month back work amazing 1440p go worry upgrading couple year
would good combo gaming 5600x would okay thats afford assume am4 motherboard already
really unfortunate honestly sorry hear eastern europe people selling 900 series gtx card 250 u equivalent possible card shipped purchased u seller break importation law
pricing leak leak especially ignored theyre likely wrong often part bc changed last minute official release past say 900 maybe itll likely itll way cheaper well wait week see scalping open q much seems like scalper focus limited supply nvidia card well see
doesnt really matter anymore nvidia priced 5070 ti 750 amd price 9070 xt 700 mean 9070 would 600
difference 6 week 6 month though
come fps visual quality dlss4 give 2540 higher fps visual quality equivalent native even better sometimes amd cant compete theyre far behind 910 gamers choose nvidia
httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophp12gbgigabytegeforcertx4070windforceocaktivpcie40x16retail1489368html 550 4070 5070 similarly priced
know cheapest seen 489 past month looking
yeah insane seeing b580 lose performance 5700x3d despite cpu holding back much powerful 4080 super
gn admission tested fairly limited suite compared hardware unboxed
steve clear result invalidate people conclusion showed effect disappears high resolution crank every setting max hardware unboxed ran test configuration much closer someone tight budget would actually play game
yap puzzled review seeing driver overhead post expected worst normal seems like damage battlemages reputation done matter misguided reviewer intentional foul play
b580 b570 lose performance paired low endmid cpu defeat whole point entry level gpu httpsyoutubebujsnbvyxvasic9qioxn4ef4hcq3 httpsyoutubecyojr3masi0ylke7xcatndmonh
apu died buying new cpu
b450 tomhawk max
would prevent boot regardless cpu cause boot 3200g 5700g checked firmware version case ubuntu done something crazy version greatly appreciate feedback btw thanks lot
yeah trying maximize am4 board 32gb ram already decent ssd plus since 3200g side testing problem like future could always move gpu new build newer chipset leave current build 3200g kid utility build kind thing
youd usually pay tax top 23 total cost including shipping 225 thats 63 extra top
facebook marketplace edit people downvoting think used gpus bad lmao
also interesting 5700x3d faster 7600x gaming overall 7600x experienced significantly less intel driver overhead necessarily surprising still noteworthy
pure cope vendetta hardware unboxed loved card initially vram price performance came gn also said result got dont invalidate reviewer point issue bad higher resolution setting youre realistically gon na entry level graphic card
youre spending 500 gpu ill guess youll get decent cpu wouldnt worry cpu issue still exist
hard say thing bit mysterious without knowing exactly go people possible know there new cpu reset parameter mystery really cpu shouldnt usually able fry like software o shouldnt changing anything bios usually
yeah make sense
could find 2070s better around price point someone u able willing ship could good deal youve got money buy new imo id get 7800xt wait another couple month amd drop 9000 series along hopefully new cuda frame work best luck man
guess youre getting downvoted fb marketplace reliable source everyone cant guarantee want especially youre major metropolitan area possible scammer deal unsure condition card probably warranty also stating friend got one 370 without also stating got used bit apple orange
probably extra memory bandwith ddr5
isnt basically everything am4 affected though op would buy motherboard ram
definitely give shot report back work find way remotely buy beer everyone saying coincidence maybe dist upgrade pushed dying cpu edge 3yo 1 week cpu never pushed hard though find odd yes thats 1 week warranty expired talk coincidence thank
op replied info
dont think apple orange comparison used pc part absolutely fine one thread said wanted new one youre budget id always try get hand used part except psu storage even big box store like best buy microcenter recommended lot available everywhere
try open third slot case first hole smal pcie slot
get 5080 line upgrade cpu yes overkill time upgrade whole system catch
course applies last genrtx 4000 would think decade old hardware would new one
u go 40 50 u upgrade part compulsorily need upgrade ur cpu ur mobo u go 40 series u make 850w psu even tho thats enough 50 series well would recommend getting 1000 w atleast coming gpu 50804080 70 40 series job almost always depends u looking wouldnt recommend spending much 5090 unless u really actual use case u go 4090 instead personal recommendation pricebest performance 4070ti
buy unknown gpu older model tested speak wait 50 series approved still would go older gpu better value money
5080 fine 1440p max setting 4k reduced setting
4070 5070 unless youre trying get 4k id say 5080 overkill
5070 ti might something look vram 4080 5080 performance cost less look like good card
depends game want play want play game bit older 7900xtx want play game releasing future would get 4080 super 5080
people disappointed 50 series expected kind miraculous new performance benchmark instead performance 40 series equal price core count want powerful stuff thats 50 series youre upgrading 10 series pretty much anything huge upgrade nevermind raytracing thats becoming requirement
considering fact youre still old hardware mean upgrade per decade said go highest end stuff afford
nvidia geforce rtx 5080 best gpu get unless go crazy rtx 5090 earth hear rtx 5080 would substantial upgrade thats crazy going 1070 5080 probably 4x5x multiplier maybe even rtx 5080 definitely recommended route go im running rtx 4070 ti super dont much reason upgrade money issue absolutely would go 5080 5090 latest generation nvidia tensor core 5000 series massive improvement 4000 series lot people dont take account evaluating performance difference one important factor
get best gpu fit budget need
amd rx 6800 average 350400 dont say budget pair nicely cpu got
kind gpu pretty severely limited old cpu likely wont get high fps remotely modern game id consider cpu upgrade along gpu likely gon na skyrocket upgrade cost new cpu mean new motherboard new ram least 5080 pretty high end card going 1070 even 40704070ti super better would significant upgrade
4090 ti budget isnt problem option go team red keep getting competitive price
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build im
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
1440p max setting overkill 2080 run game 1440p high setting 40705070 would better option
ive already got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d 5090 abit budget
6800 xt good card dont know ops budget feel bit silly pair best gaming cpu market 2 generation old midhigh end card
100 get 7800xt wouldnt spend 350 500 6800
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
set congratulation mate wish enough money upgrade like
yea thats good pairing pair am5 mobo amd expo ram u good u waiting 50 series stock might well wait ryzens new line processor eye 9950x3d
depends high many fps want
whatever best thats next 5080 amd want wait whatever else
perform worse actually
well youre pretty much set monster lol
thanks year making fair
nothttpscdnmoscmsfuturecdnnet3buqtn5dzgqi7zl8xs4wulpng also better upscaling framegen capability ai accelerator 6800 xt
think im worried future proof card 16gb vram cant afford 5090
5080 thinking 4080 super 1015 according leak last long long time mate 16gb vram sure couldve 20 24 peace mind thats nvidias segmentation 16gb still gon na fine 1440p even 4k least year vram capacity becoming important nowadays bad people make yet
okay ryzen 7 9800x3d 5080 future proof good
4090 5090 powerful setup could currently build yeah pretty much
okay thanks think wanted clarification
assuming youre playing least 1440p gpu bottleneck large majority time 12900k 9900x would perform similarly reason 12900k doesnt double amount thread core core pcores performance core two thread per core ecores efficiency core one thread per core would still go 9900x though since consumes less power platform receive least one generation cpu future
using pc anything gaming
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19html efficiency core 12900k dont anything gaming plus beyond 8 performance core there littleno benefit sometimes even detrimental due ccdchiplet design am5 cpu
gaming would still recommend going am5 7700x 9700x plenty 7600x3d would also good alternative arent thread always 2x multiple core 12900x 16 24 normally yes intel changed architecture performance efficiency core efficiency core dont multithreading 8 p core 2 8 e core 24 latest generation core ultra doesnt multithreading
yeah 1440p im gaming say platform supported one gen youre talking am5 supported one round cpu correct benefit would able upgrade cpu one gen requiring new motherboard somewhat subscribe upgrade philosophy build new system entirely 56 year future proofing isnt huge concern mine thanks bunch detailed response
yeah also workstation pc also play cpu intensive game like city skyline football manager cs2 intensive still cpu bound game thats im leaning towards i9ryzen 9 7
interesting gamingwise basically 8 core 16 thread
thanks reply breakdown p core e core included original post itll also workstation pc game play cpu intensive like city skyline football manager etc im leaning towards 9 7
lot game dont 8 core
pretty much unless lot multitasking video editingrendering
yup least foreseeable future perhaps 35 year game better optimized use core unlikely well see major way year next gen console release
used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly
aib model 5090s avoid whatever reason pay asus tax
got sparkle intel arc a310 eco tforce vulcan 25 inch ssd know powerful stuff play league legend pc want 144fps stuff get know pci 4 slot card resizable bar needed
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax v2 decent enough motherboard ryzen 5 7600x 64gb ram
im thinking getting new pc upgrading current one something ive never done spec need find current pc share see would better video card one know sure need radeon rx 580
want bench test cpu motherboard ram make sure component work wait gpu without installing cpu cooler im going sff cooler block ram would repaste cpu replace ram end issue ram
hey live israel gpu market kinda expensive rtx 4070 ti super go like 1165 store sapphire rx 7600 xt 16gb go 455 asrock amd radeon rx 6700 xt challenger pro 12gb oc much would guy pay gpu second hand get around 200250 good deal considering price listed
5080 review start coming
thing dustproof build build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible
game dev would recommend going amd card higher vram nvidia card lower vram nvidia card really expensive tough choice
hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
got 9700x rest build cant find video card save life right looking 4070 super something close around 600 good holdover card play something like fortnite 1440p reasonable framerate wait something become available
im currently running 5600 rx6600 650w psu full tower case going lan party pain im thinking swapping itx case thats backpack size concern psu according pcpartpicker rig consume around 260w go 300w 400w flex psu
would better get 750w psu 12vhpwr connector 1000w psu without one im probably going get 4070 super 5070
im new pc building build found sub im interested 7600 rx7800xt cost 1000 question much downgrade bit choose like cheaper gpu still able easily play modern game smoothly keep saving make build build httpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42klhttpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42kl sorry dumb question
likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup

thing dustproof build make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect
thing dustproof build best get case easy remove toolless panel tray filter pop run fawcet leave dry pop right back often couple week youll avoid worst still get layer dust inside eventually component fan blade frame youll clean recommend looking fractal design case since usually nice filter decent brand nowadays offer
amd gpu decent game development rgamedevhttpswwwredditcomrgamedevcomments15auicgisanamdgpudecentforgamedevelopment here helpful thread provide good insight
part yeah part distinct piece puzzle fit work take old part motherboard put new motherboard profit real concern storage window install window gotten pretty good detecting new hardware like new motherboard configuring existing install perfect back data continuing case process go bad reformat reinstall o may also run window activation issue youre oem license since thats tied old motherboard ive luck calling microsoft telling youve swapped motherboards due old one dying theyll hook code fix install activated microsoft accountlinked key fix sign back
used 3070
anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough
400w sure 300 way close computer power usage
id argue would want wiggle room future expandability id also argue going small enough mandate flexatx unit difficult build occasional lan party might need go small look option like coolermaster nr200p deepcool ch160 fractal design terra take cheaper flexible sfx psus case might backpackable definitely fit duffel bag alongside peripheral ask know
gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan
thanks friendo hoping hear assumed would work puzzle wanted make sure wouldnt shenanigan m2 popped new mobo mainly keep concern mind booting hope dont reformat reinstall end day really steam game biggie
4060 290 perhaps
window right click task bar open task manager click detail button open info go performance tab able get info
dust filter going completely prevent dust getting caking fan airflow would terrible
name emphasis custom p spend shitton money contract someone help thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan fan access air thats push airflow eventually get dust finer dust filter less dust fan worse airflow coarser dust filter dust fan better airflow lian li new case lancool somethingorother cant remember numerical designation came last year button jiggle front fan quickly try dislodge dust honestly practical solution pick case like mentioned filter easy removeclean fan nice accessible

think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090
want put 2070 pasture badly 5080 5090 look like nvidia funneling 5080 supertibothwhatever

5090 lot faster potential 4090 ti
almost like pure rasterization power plateauing way keep pumping performance pump power consumption price
post rnvidia youll get well ackshually even though spirit correct modest jump huge jump price power consumption exactly youd expect 4090ti redesigned core feature arent important performance power consumption make seem like mid gen refresh

5090 isnt gaming card ai tinkering card

dude 4k good test card even best cpu difference increase 8k
came someone watching closely title made think 5080 content see

yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come
deleted
yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem

believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus

well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd

depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

find let know please rocking 2080 super real need upgrade maybe superti variant come would like purchase msrp im patient person waiting couple month doesnt bother
2070s checking upgraded 219 1440p beginning struggle 5800x3d fine im thinking upgrade im beginning turn setting game medium low
restocked holding card x amount time dont purchase within window lose place line want retailer wipe as whine semantics
test peaked 697 watt nut
much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
possibly wouldnt pay kind money used gpu warranty history melting connector
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

lol got fe 4080s around price week back
almost seems like know 24gb 5080ti coming bet sits price point 4090 doesnt make sense massive vram gap
problem 5080 looking 200 4080 super canada
want good advertised sold 23 frame manufactured looking good hope wrong
ill sell mine
going want 5090 cant afford
update 4090
1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
sure a6000 48gb 7300
coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation
ps5 pro frame generation insertion seen aidriven technology extend strictly upscaling project amethyst discussed fg amd backing high end gpu segment said moving focus back mainstream market place amd hope maintaining decent earnings issue plagued current generation top end offering misunderstand concern around machine learning ai im worried happening supplanting traditional rendering method im worried people going see gain 5090 4090 assume lower tiered card going similar raster rt gain likely nvidia pushed review 5080 far possiblelet 5090 review drop early 5070ti isnt even thing right want mindset cemented average buyer blackwell big jump ada well evidence contrary start appearing hell think dlss fsr4 finally get gamechanging technology come supplementing raw compute required traditional rendering method 6 year ago garbage 20series poorly received rt seen gimmick top poor priceperf improvement
still confused 15 core equates 1 performance yes core scaling isnt linear thats point comparison improvement raster rt core minimal 40series going seeing big gain last gen across stack 5070 seems particularly awkward spot guess well find 5080 disappoints couple day though
netflix running idea show sadly itll banger get cancelled two season
best buy dont believe obviously want real see notify come stock button
dlss already considered without set performance dont even start game anymore would nice rely much though poe2 demanding ill think bit maybe even consider 4080 super
well suck

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month
midlate ampere thing lovelace went right back early ampere add cartout stock
bestbuy doesnt offer waitlist notify come stock nothing pleasant email come already botted
great give time save money evga wait list 3090 worked well enough
discord channel good
feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

cant speak bb actually going use 40 series bh literally send confirmation email option get signed biweekly update say still list whatevs eventually get email saying restocked like 24 hour something actually buy card lose spot oem manufacturer well dont post notify link actual launch got 2040 series card evga asus bh still dont believe dont know tell
wow didnt realize 3080 ti could actually bogged mean 3060 ti struggle minecraft 4k shaders without shaders could run 8k still nail 60 fps probably already impressed xd might build machine 3080 ti point cuz like 30 series overall except 3050 nobody like 3050 good doesnt deserve anything hate get 4080 super good alternative youre looking upgrade one gen go 50 series
got got alienware 3225qf ive got 4k 240hz looking build new system 5090 might alley currently 5 year old rig 2080 super
wasnt talking pushpull setup rather fan blow air across card lengthwise rather card youd need fairly thick card make work 2slot card would limit tiny 40mm fan 3 4 slot many card already could use 6080mm fan move lot air much lower speed would aided natural fronttoback airflow many tower case already
true 2000 financed inflation negligible 5 inflation 24 month thats 200 buying 2k gpu 200 doesnt mean much
ahh thats pity scalper win

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement
never said observation needed pump core count power limit get kind increase previously one neither node shrink clear dealing significantly improved raster rt core last gen put card closely aligned spec weird spot
miss evga best havent personally heard direct sale notification queue im sure anyone intel wed like know im signed whatever get feel like im mostly going bet farm snagging launch minute pick notification never helped back 30 series fiasco
commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin
im restrospect shouldve shelled little bit 4090 cest la vie got enjoy powerful card rarely found wanting almost 3 year
genuinely relevant career youre making enough get ai workstation better yet private rack somewhere way prolevel card two thats stretch dont really need learn ai career there really lot edge case dont fall one two group
im nerd want im sure much use something like 5090 diy ai vast majority model likely going train run fine whatever right truly big boy stuff wont anything less data center small window want run train something big easier rent resource plus youd unable use machine anything else daysweeks
look like 3090 founder going 750900ish kinda range ebay moment id probably look local buyer kinda range though friend who 2070 super melted recently he making due brother old 1080 ti favor like watch dog free sometimes ill probably offer friend discount first especially since paid 500

honestly unless near microcenter timeability potentially camp launch wouldnt bother would set many waitlistnotifications possible wait patiently first card thats available rip evga best
understand sound like correctly however take active second step original comment stand make sense productive cash repayment
well dont laptop skus show kind scaling time could keep power limit core theyd clock lower
honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
use 28 4k work great
27 1440p sweet spot reason
went 32 va 1440p 28 ip 4k didnt like ended selling 32 returning 28 buying 3x 1440p 27 ip work gaming 4070s 5080 id go 32 4k 500

recently went gtx1060 1080p 27 4080s 1440p aw3423dwf tell difference staggering figured setup provide solid frame rate aaa title easily 5 year 34 monitor really nice afraid would big think really end perfect could easily afford 40905090 4k monitor 4k oled monitor choice still bit limited size option ultimately think 34 oled monitor 1440 make better overall experience 27 even 4k plus youll get fps 1440 machine wont require upgrade soon
4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful
got 27 5k imac 2019 enjoyed every moment waste
ran 4k awhile loved 4070ti handled perfectly
unsure one looking know people judge saying asus got good deal 4k 144hz ip monitor bought one 560
im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate
would gimp experience reason nvidia blackwell gpu render everypixelanew 1440p60 render 4k240 framegen upscaling welcome 2025
240hz waste money
wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp
got 4k 48inch tv mainly watching shit game well shit nice couldnt pas black friday sale
whole sweet spot thing bang buck availability people point dont 4k 1440p monitor compribale size cant side side comparison ops budget allows get gpu push performance full send budget limited got 1440p 27 think look great however 17 4k panel editing laptop ill tell look amazing infinitly crispier desktop monitor pixel density noticeable side side
level scaling use
im waiting pg27ucdm 4k oled 27 inch monitor ive playing 24 inch 1080p screen although could desk space 32 dont think im ready jump yet
depends viewing distance 27 inch 4k complete waste sit 3 screen sit 2 foot screen going need excellent eyesight tell difference sit 12 away definitely tell
waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better
anything past 140ppi honestly pointless 27 smallest go 4k resolution 32 perfect size

bet response time refresh rate bigger uplift dont blame titan x came 2015 gamed 4k tv barely 2845 fps sli setup waiting 5 generation upgrade good call part
almost ppi 24 1080p considered lowend sweet spot
sweet spot budget build build 5 series
okay mr fancy pant 32 foot 1440p
must beefy benq projector prop dude lol
nope there single game play us upscaling tv broadcasting
hdr400 isnt low
reason chose dwf dw understanding dw gsync compatible would suited nvidia gpu
4k 120144hz common within reasonable price range considering buyer already buying 5080
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
interesting point regret refresh rate
went 4k felt like wasting 4070 ti super 1080 gaming wow certainly night day every screen life look like cheap toy
he getting 5080
jump pixel density often higher 1440p 4k 1080p 1440p look popular screen size respective ppi lot time see people go small 1080p screen big 1440p screen actually lose pixel density
1 1080p 2k 1440p 25k 2 25k 78 pixel 2k 100 3 4k 225 time pixel 25k roughly 4 time 2k
golden rule pixel density phone tablet much higher 27 4k youre fine actually enjoy
swear oled screen making blinder everyday
many people like work mainly play factorio demanding game play moment maybe elite icarus
4k relevant resolution game feel like game would perfectly fine 1440p240hz well
one buy 5080 play doom want play newer game
smooth cursor get enough love opening menu window glorious 240hz
old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
tv care far away sitting desk youre going sitting spot regardless monitor get going big possibly handle seems like dumb advice course reddit could never
almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah

samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p

nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
there thing future proof either help
2 day ago gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet
went 3600x stock wraith spire cooler 5800x3d tried using wraith 5800x3d load thermal throttled recommend
age many people refuse even admit made mistake salute honest idiot
last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked
recently dealt gpu performance issue year finally figured slightly dislodged move receiving x1 pcie lane
one day find plastic
almost situation looking upgrade monster hunter wild asus tuf b450 pro ryzen 5 3600x rtx 3070 upgrade cpu graphic card ryzen 9 5900xt rtx5080
like 3080 5700x3d combo upgradedsidegraded 5600x 5700x3d im sure there noticeable difference maybe thats old 5600x little beast lol
ive seen worse could one story sat cpu bending every single pin
somewhat offtopic anyone know deepcool ak400 suffice cooling 5700x3d
lol exact thing 3 week ago
well least discovered new form thermal insulation honestly plasticcooled new category weve man prop sharing
always baffle many people talk missing dont get clearly visible coming someone forgets io shield time bent pin cpu first pc built
missed decade
make feel better despite knowing full well parent aio 2008 technically didnt meet requirement window 11 spent whole day trying shoehorn anyways knew possible get around requirement done try toil trying different method prepare install medium happened upon obscure bit information newest win 11 build dropped sse41 requires sse42 unfortunately t5850 core dual doesnt supportunderstand sse42 instruction physically impossible run win 11 core dual system thorough clean repaste throwing cheap ssd perfectly usable win 10
solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

yeah plastic covershttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcsearchqplasticcoverrestrictsronsortrelevancetall bane first time builder
feel seen
future resistant haha
im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case
appreciate
ohhhh
ive definitely done
crazy often stuff work barely really shouldnt
oooof
like said surprisingly effective
missed saw accepted responsibility forgot
clearly day
op need coffee
10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even

indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine
7600x3d xfx magnetic air 7900xtx hell combo im 4k

sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
people dont care dead silent pc especially headphone speaker playing youre mashing mouse keyboard fan get drowned
yes use lower quality component lower heat rating since fan always blowing air expensive model almost always 0rpm mode due better internal componenet rating cheaper psu usually tighter spec equal wattage expensive unit internals rated output
buy better psu
probably requires component couple cent expensive way make buy expensive model
really couldnt care less noise pc make even open back headphone basically inaudible ingame sound play let alone music
sound like cousin didnt buy great psu fan noise top desired feature list psus built well enough run without fan blowing
psu fan never come love psu fan always nosiest opinion
put way psu doesnt 0 rpm mode case 7 fan sat desk sit recording vocal mixing music dont notice picked recording good psu doesnt need 0 rpm already near silent sound like buddy bad noisy one youve tuned fan quiet moving enough air psu getting hot revving cool try raising rpm case fan little psu slows find happy medium isnt one probably noisy psu
really annoying machine doesnt sound need feedback make something like hum click etc miss spinning hdds couple fan dont bother
isnt big market good psus make little noise first place
see lot people saying 0rpm doesnt matter youre gaming headphone thats point 0rpm mode youre gaming psu going running fan regardless pc idling im task doesnt require headphone dont want distracted psu fan going crazy
never use mode psus never noticed psu source noise
seasoniccorsair psus dont audible fan noise 0rpm isnt always needed
thermaltake gf1 silent smart fan switch isnt bad price 80 plus gold may need invest different psu
probably noise emitted psu minimal pc idle cant hear fan anyways
yes reduces price
changed psu fan control via cpu temp
thats company dont bother 0rpm company make power supply eco mode many year internal fan doesnt turn p get really hot
psu cultist atier includes sound profile grading b tier best class get sound included grading basically wont buy anything outside tier anymore
changed corsair vs550 msi a850g difference huge corsair psu loudest part pc completely silent desktop hear pc gpu hit 60 degree
every 10 watt psu provides 1 watt becomes heat inside psu need spend good amount get psu cope heat passively
hope company never stop release psus gpus without 0rpm mode want fan last longer wear faster constant startstop bullshit pain as replace
super flower leadex vii 1300w zero rpm feature toggled onoff switch
company still sell cheaper psus lower quality part would great without airflow yes cut cost hopefully saving passed consumer another way saying buying expensive isnt buying quality overpriced crap
cant even hear psu fan running small amount airflow increase reliability
love loud fan pc way know working
simple answer people buy
even pretty cheap psu probably doesnt go 0 rpm basically silent im playing game dont see huge reason
feel need make sure hear computer something wrong little bit fan noise bad annoying
replaced 16 year old ultra x3 psu died one cheaper quiet psus doesnt 0rpm mode kneel beside cant tell apart cpu case fan
mine silent mode dont bother using time hear pc fan get going anyway rog thor 1000w iirc want know
ive turned every evga power supply ive owned annoying hear fan suddenly ramp settle second unit temp threshold cycle
certainly dont care dont use pc without headphone anyways
see lot tinnitus candidate thread good guy constant weeeeeeeeee hear keep company grow older
silent say 7 noctua 3000 rpm fan case controlled fan expert dont care noise play headset anyway
im worried psu lasting long
actually prefer white noise like white noise time otherwise noise seem nauseating like room dead silent hear mechanical keyboard clicking id go insane sleep white noise always ceiling fan high laregely im heavy sleeper sleep bulldozer outside literally modern pc generate much heat becoming impossible silent pc
airflow always required active component generate heat way around except passively cooled power supply finding one power modern gaming pc nigh impossible
0 rpm cost slightly money yes motor range theyre efficient 0 rpm ramping speed almost always one least efficient regime plus 0 anything weird number physic act going 0 nonzero weird rotational jerk characteristic im sure introduces vibration nonideal way structural aerospace engineer would probably prefer reduce number 0 nonzero cycle mean 0 rpm mode plus good headphone speaker completely negate issue anyway
didnt know fan tuning thing building pc year
yeah noise something worry especially since either something playing tv phone wear headphone becomes background noise bit anyways
exactly psu dont 0 rpm nice probably dont great passive cooling last cybercore used fan 40 load
honestly im glad subscribed linus idea putting computer another room easiest way remove noise push somewhere else
play game watch video
fair opinion feel like people dont see way
nut guess miss high pitched screeching crt tv well
exactly people talking like headphone solution everything well everyone us headphone watch hd movie surround sound system mine wife watch loud distracting noise coming computer would take u movie ruin experience
ok know say common experience fan kick power supply pull watt start heat say oversized 1200watt platinum evga power supply doesnt start fun even game full load system marginally get 600watt bought psu need different current set utilised benefit never kicking fan
psus zero rpm fan mode control fan curve tuning set power drawn instead temperature generally notice turn unless regularly max power output psu
installed corsair rm850x shift year ago ive never heard even run passively 30 40 load spin quietly havent heard yet buy quality model cheaper one
also fan constantly running gather much dust
doesnt affect something must wrong classic response ive hearing pc community decade
impossible still get pretty quiet overspend cooling accept performance penalty recent build 4070ti r9 7900 people would say completely inaudible even full gaming load
like dog people leave tv radio
like confidently wrong power supply eco mode fact looking 3 pc right eco mode fan turn psu hot enough require fan spin big enough psu get fan never spin never asked enough power heat sufficiently kick fan yes know might impact efficient sweet spot psu matter power consumption airflow always required system dissipating enough heat ksit natural convection threadripper system 3080 evga platinum 1200watt psu even gaming load doesnt kick fan doesnt even reach 50 psu rating load
would also allow heavy oc would definitely take advantage fact cant hear pc heavily oc gpu cpu run aggressive fan curve stay cool make silent youre gon na hear anyway
game pc reliably isnt max length hdmi cable
pc produce little noise regular operation could easily made even quieter wished aio run needlessly high idle fan speed counter ramping noise fan make major temp fluctuation wanted could make pc even quieter due boosting behaviour 7800x3d fan actually loudest ramping higher speed chip may boost beyond 70c couple second even mundane task setting low fan speed light work would still cause random spike noise leaving reasonably low level prevents excess noise could make seperate fan curve use really needed pc quieter simply choose
dont remember high pitch crt degaussing noise cool
could often tell tv turned different room apparently one knew could hear
love confidently replied actually reading wrote never said fan wouldnt spin said active component generate heat heat might passively dissipated low power consumption 0 rpm said psu start heat start spin fan guess youve never heard pc silent winter cold room become rb211 hot day load
say
could run ac unit keep room cold like server room
optical hdmi cable go even 300 foot
active cable thunderbolt depends far away put use regular cable side wall linuss current method us usb fiber box probably good option ive used thunderbolt 3 great work big pain doesnt recently converted main pc vm host thunderbolt didnt want play nice plenty option usb display cable huge length
young hear wouldnt call screeching though white noise
im obsessed oc low temp couple year aggressuve fan curve started drive mad let component reach high 60 case feel like theyre kinda hot people daily running 80c friend mine using 1050ti 90c around 10h per day rendering gaming lasted 6 year guess got ta stop obsessed also tend overshare fucking lot coul tell lmao
hit belt
cant hear anymore either got ta grow someday
im rocking asrock b650e steel legend complaint
go pcpartpicker com use make sure everything compatible motherboards specifically lookup review board youre interested tend good advice like hardware unboxed motherboard review
x870 tomahawk lane sharing plain simple
b650 b650e fine
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax 9800x3d 64 gig cl30 ram fantastic b650 board would work fine cost way less
m2 ssds pcie 40 50
money objection x870e taichi otherwise b850 livemixer b650 gaming plus
asrock released b850 line picked riptide delivery today
4080s 9800x3d cant afford high end motherboard x670e x870e lane
gigabyte x870 gaming wifi6 wifi7 pcie gen 5 m2 slot gen 5 x16 slot gpu good bluetooth wifi great io built 2 build friend 9800x3d work like charm edit 3 ssds dont notice performance dip dont know much lane issue
went asrock x870e nova avoid lane sharing also generally well regarded
im wrong x670e tomahawk shouldnt lane sharing issue regarded fairly decent motherboard asrock b650e riptide
asus rog crosshair x670e gene
cpugpu think ram causing issue here build httpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vfhttpspcpartpickercomlistybm2vf
get decent looking mid range board dont need anything crazy b650 chipset probably fine
asrock x870 riptide lane sharing us killer lan doesnt realtek lan issue reported x870 board decent price little expensive budget board going break bank either also support 9800x3d straight box bios flashback needed
went asrock x870 riptide good hardware unboxed made video x870 board
am5 board right im mistaken upgrade path leading 9800x3d pretty long asrock b650 pg lightning work
b650ee issue far
gigabyte 850 ai top
get cheapest b650 motherboard 3 m2 port thats like asrock b650m pro r something 5090 loses 1 going pcie 5 x16 pcie 4 x16 1 enabling ray tracing exact performance 2 pcie generation unless move thousand terabyte daily ssds pcie 3 4 5 wont ever see feel difference dont complicate thing dont spend hype marketing
b850 pro r wifi pretty much perfect board
im using asrock taichi lite x870e
right ended going b850 steel legend there excel sheet somewhere around reddit updated mobos spec kinda helpful helping pick one
b850 650 would work mother board isnt important gaming gpu cpu
thing lane conductive metal theyre using generation pcie put gpu gold pcie 50 lane youll get better performance copper pcie 30 lane thing nvmes got ta careful pick though thing wont always fit particular slot 4070 fit top lane motherboard dont think 2 slot card would meaning would put lower tier slot thus getting less performance
avoid asus would go asrock right value feature
avoid gigabyte lineup shared pcie lane think x870 tomahawk doesnt share gpu pcie lane m2 slot used search msi website find specific model interested look manual reference
doesnt cpu decide many lane
asus b650ee fine setup despite people say 4080 super run full pcle 40 x16 speed youll enough lane m2 drive make sure put fastest ssd top slot want absolutely sure extra cash x670e board offer pcle 50 lane probably overkill people
ive got asrock b650 none steel legend complaint either yes ive got pcie 5 support gpu ssd 1
put 3 m2 ssds problem without cutting speed
good choice mobo good hard find stock
ive seen people suggesting avoid gigabyte asus motherboards whats issue curiosity
dont worry dont need use ssd slot
motherboard manufacturer chooses lane wired pcie 5 board wanted pcie 5 m2 slot one slot share lane gpu slot lane gpu get 16 lane unless certain m2 filled case get 8 lane 8 used m2 instead board gpu mean top pcie slot doesnt share lane anything else board manufacturer also chooses lane come cpu chipset except top pcie slot always use cpu lane since thats defacto gpu slot
u cant m22 cut usb 40 gig port half disable want full speed m2 m23 take pcie slot expansion slot equipped m24 isnt pcie 5
people hugely overrestimate big difference lane sharing make mostly game pcie 5 board difference x16 x8 lane 01 matter storage go
problem
true newegg seems getting constant stock recently got mine need get app tell stock jump oni
asus think rma everything honor duty fix problem
people say avoid gigabyte
sorry didnt mean say gigabyte lol sorry typed way fast
nice know im america already running steel legend
think 8600g actually slower 5600x tiny margin probably worth rolling whole as ddr5 build
sell cpu get 5700x3d money
ressell really good cpu
would sell get 5700x3d way get upgrade dont swap am5 granted manage sell used market always volatile itll help funding 5700x3d
really 8500g half l3 cache limited number pcie lane also us two full speed core 4 older slower core
8500g marginally slower 5600x roughly par 5600 httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen58500g17html also efficient though useless want upgrade aint
change current setup make low cost home server cheapest motherboard cheap ram ssd low power psu small old case 400 cost got low power home server setup 247
sell get either 5700x3d sell gpu well get faster gpu like used 6700xt3060tirx6800
5700x3d would cheaper overall faster gaming g series cpu usually one gen behind 5600g offered 3600 performance 8500g close 7500f due low l3 cache
would say keep new processor upgrade mobo ram especially since likely upgrade sometime road anyways point youd getting cpu mobo ram new processor better plus youll getting better ram youll see difference sure later would upgrading cpu anyways focus solely cpu maybe gou point youll 2 upgrade already way thing would really highly recommend mobo make sure memory clock speed high enough enable expo mobos ive seen support like 4500mhz ram also make sure mobo good vrm 8500g 65 watt cpu problem finding anything handle mainly later get new cpu say got mobo right vrm handle 105 watt cpu want put 120 watt cpu need upgrade mobo worth extra buck make sure mobo good enough future upgrade
deleted
pretty sure ops post mention 8500g 5600 non x arguing want make sure youre comparing correct product change much op considering going am5 anyway would cheap way always get actual cpu upgrade later
personal opinion dataset back claim 8600g newer architecture improved single multithreaded performance integrated graphic 760m isnt something sneeze everyday light 1080p perfect personally use 5600g htpc id upgrade 8600geventually higher clock speed pcie 50 support 5600x lower price 50 cheaper neck wood larger l3 cache thing op would need ram mobo go budget itll cost much am5 am4and advantage able upgrade path future
passmark 8500g slightly faster single corehttpswwwcpubenchmarknetcompare4811vs5841amdryzen55600vsamdryzen58500g come wash gaming got lighter cache wouldnt completely replatform accommodate op want move smaller system used b550ib550m board would play sell 8500g fund swap
way sold cpu many people message wild posted 10 buck cheaper others gone instantly got free list decent price someone take super fast upgraded 5800x3dwas order 5700x3d 219 found 5800x3d 250 locally used amazing doubled fps tarkov absolutely love massive massive upgrade good probably skip am5 im giving kid year building itx 9800x3d5080 build son hasnt begging pc he good fucking kid truly deserves would completely skip am5
client wanted probably
received wrong package amazon told keep free
yeah sell nib 8600g throw money much faster anything simply doesnt make sense selling point igpu doesnt need
pcie 50 support 8000g processor pcie 40 support 8 lane top pcie slot 8500g 4 lane even limited hybrid zen 4c design
deleted
straight game numbersyes isnt op spend time sell 8600g know someone buy far easier likely he going sell online present whole number issue annoyance telling op build new pc dead platform 5600x upgrade path dumb
read ordered mac motherboard received cpu didnt order cpu
never said build anything said worth building whole new rig around 8600g discernable improvement worth time hassle side grade
op isnt building pc dead platform read anything said am4 build super easy sell cpu posted mine fb week ago 50 people message woke thr guy bought messaged legit less 5 min posted esp decent deal free post cheaper use money get 5700x3d gaming 5900x whatever budget building entire new am5 build working am4 build low end cpu stupid lol using money 5700x3d 5900x even 5950x used would way better upgrade
am5 little reason use ddr56000 cl30 memory yes 7500f enough general gaming relative budget
ive managed i52500k since 2013 upgraded ssd gtx 1060 3gb ram guess id manage 7500f better go corsair vengeance ddr5 6000 mhz 32 gt cl40 80 used wondering future proofing would sense make go powerful cpu see ill manage get new one 5 year
future proofing spending spend even later unless getting x3d cpu isnt much advantage better am5 cpu unless want core even gaming performance isnt much different simply put want ddr56000 cl30 possible cl40 wont lose much performance though
experience ddr5 4800 mhz finicky term motherboard compatibility return 6000 mhz kit bought common respected brand buy 4800 mhz kit found manufacturer compatibility list wouldnt really sweat difference much
arnt already am4 dont get am4 get even 7600x get am5 upgrade save later
fast ram
ram friend ram identical unlikely youll able run mixed kit rated xmp setting am4 chip require fast ram optimal performance whats budget upgrading
personally ram cheap 100 32 gb ram isnt bad add budget newest am5 stuff
would try go am5 possible get something like 7500f
money get am5 cuz upgrade faster ram get 7600 7500f itam 5 better money dont go am4 get ryzen 7 5700x3d work good like 4 year wont upgrade cpu
ask friend lend 100bucks ddr5 instead run single channel ddr5 month afford another one yes recommended end world month dont think going am4 maybe find incredibly cheap motherboard amazing deal 5800x3d otherwise dont limit ddr4 youre gon na future proof
ddr4 ram plenty fast purpose day still however yes would agree 32gb would bare minimum day would happily accept friend offer extra ram boost maybe consider intel 12900k ryzen 5700x context im running 3950x 16 physical core 64gb ddr4 nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super super awesome gaming medium development system ddr5 ram future build waiting cpu price come ryzen 9000 series
go am5 instead am4 am4 dead platform meaning new release platform get 7600x 7700x want get onto am5 cheap go get 7800x3d 9800x3d money isnt issue even cheapest am5 option wont bottleneck gpu especially 1440p youll need new motherboard ddr5 ram go like b650 32gb may also want quick look online see current psu handle upgraded hardware
here build using microcenter bundle added great cpu cooler well incase needed new one httpspcpartpickercomlistnnwqgj dont know rest spec youd fill hopefully import storage device psu case however thing pick need road unless dont fit work already
dont run 4 stick ram run much slower share channel always run 2 stick big impact performance would go am5 since buy mobo cpu anyways
2133 mhz
noticed lot people recommended am5 probably go psu 1100w ok im playing 1440p thats probably another reason go am5
way ram speed interacts speed infinity fabric ryzen cpu perform better faster ram 2133 slow itll cost decent amount cpu performance 3600 sweet spot 30005000 series am4 since get better ram anyways may well go am5
yeah lot people post agree tbf 3080 need bit oomph anyways
also regarding ram get c40 c36 matter
6000 cl30 ddr5
6700 xt 6750 xt find one either 7600 xt b580
b580 competition find one msrp
intel arc b580 competition ups budget get awesome card
6750xt 6700xt b580 7600xt order best best haha
planning using
stretch bit rx 6750 xt 360390 euro best youll get price range
3080 ebay
cant find b580 retail b570 also seems perform really well think change drastic doesnt really matter get
sell 8 gb stick put two 16 gb stick
sell memory buy pair best way possible dual mode may deactivated timing set safe slow work rare case wont start
guarantee run 3200 bought another stick 3200 mixing memory always increase chance doesnt work expected would run flex mode would 8gb8gb running dual channel remaining 8gb would run single channel 16gb memory needed imo unless need capacity likely going result situation
recommendation new 2x16 set replace get new 2x16 3200 ddr4 set 50 unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably dont use timing case way either motherboard try figure youre customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip youd make sure pretty thorough stability test
gpu might worth trying boot integrated graphic assume boot drive showing bios
reset bios unplugging psu either shorting cmos pin 10 second hitting button motherboard second removing cmos battery 30 second
tried fresh install window get another boot drive test existing boot drive rule corrupt o
long let attempt boot window cpuramboot led debug light lighting memory training am5 take first boot talking minute ten minute
possible something happened boot expo file corrupted try boot install medium see reset way
yes boot drive showing bios actually already dont gpu pc yet im going try 50 series day assembled rest pc yesterday make sure everything working
unfortunately ive done 10 time bring bios reset default setting trying boot still hang black screen
dont think window issue booted window fine yesterday used pc little enabling expo get back
let run 20 minute instance earlier attempt yellow light come resetting cmos reinstalling ram made go away
look restore memory context thing change auto enabled fresh window install may worth seeing cant boot usb install medium reinstall also update bios possible thing would try
even without enabling expo made sure trying boot base 4800mts ram speed
id check boot sequence see stage boot process get past always accurate help point fails boot im sure yellow light mean particular motherboard sound strange booting anymore even resetting cmos back default
yes fresh window install also updated bios yesterday beforehand im already latest version restoring memory context
yes ive hit disable expo bios well manually chosen 4800mt clock speed way boot anymore
httpswwwredditcomramdsdzoxrivizi look thread found see may possibly help pretty old would thought updated bios would rule hey never know uh yea would personally try see even boot usb window install medium least troubleshooting reinstalling window could fix issue would eliminate headache
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
board happen debug led also made sure window storage drive showing first option boot order
yes window drive first boot order actually able boot window use computer earlier since enabling expo everything got messed debug led none
see youve tried either stick time tried slot worst thing think possibly hardware issue either cpu fully socketed one ram channel dead even ram issue
im pretty sure everyone forgets psu switch io plate first time
forgot connect cpu power tried troubleshoot entire day gave sent part back forgot case pwr button cable god sake 30 year still dont easy standardized 1 connector case pin
getting 1k card payment plan getting debt
ok picture thisaustin texas 1995 saved meager money finally build pc shiny new 486dx spent day putting together bloodied finger case back death trap im feeling great hit power flicker life shuts missed dip switch miss cable everything look good wont work crestfallen verge tear slump chair wife say relax think little take advice next day renewed resolve take deeper look find missed fucking standoff board shorting case fixed like magic way dialup modem bb heaven
back case fan sucking air rather venting like year realized
put stock intel cooler 10700k wondering overheating trying boot game
old guy tell youngins dark scary old day plug play operating system talking early 90 describe hardware bios example youd need enter block head sector hard drive correctly youd risk corrupting data bricking drive didnt data sheet could always try compuserve card needed memory space hardware needed unique interrupt assigned cabling nightmare ide scsi drive stiff 3 wide cable try routing 4 single box fan available 3 type loud louder intermittent buzzing good time
taking tiny little sticker bottom cpu cooler
standoff totally didnt know thing fan blipped first time powering could never get mobo cpu work
spent 2 hour wondering new build wouldnt post bios sketchy moniter cord wrong connection faulty mb etc driving insane nearly wanted post help google post sub well classic mistake youd think ram fully seated first time nope reseated booted bios
mobo came integrated io big first time mistake avoided conveniently rested wire back fan io hole safe keeping installed mobo realised wire still hanging though mobo squashing remove mobo reinstall took age first time around
back 2010 built first pc took 57 hour forgot thermal paste cpu
build first pc around 2016 help experienced friend pc build boot signal nothing check everything connected properly yep think ended giving troubleshooting almost 2 hour obviously secondary part lying around test took local pc repair shop next day troubleshootingdiagnostics charge around 15 eur 40 minute hour later swapping cpu gpu multiple ram kit etc testing improvement decided take motherboard component case try hooking another known working psu last resort still dice said motherboard must doa send replacement upon starting unplug psu cable suddenly started mumbling fuck fucking kidding appearantly forgot plug cpu 8pin power cable didnt notice neither upon inspection routed connector motherboard never connected connected connected powersupply cable pc booted immediately pc still working order day since year half new mobo power supply one friend current gaming pc old mobo gave shortly moving new friend place didnt charge 15 eur service fee since took almost hour max 5 min check fix slight win since ive build bunch pc acquired lot knowledge past 9 year point build troubleshoot pc eye closed friend family also side hustle earn extra cash number 1 instant check still see cpu power cable connected properly also say havent occasional little moment stress pc wasnt turning realising forgot switch power supply
first build actually went without hitch funny thing latest cpumobo upgrade last year rgb wouldnt work fan drove crazy verge making 3 hour drive microcenter returning everything eureka moment next morning work stupid as forgot plug everything rgb header done countless build without issue dumb oversight lol
first time bios war assumption twice voltage twice performance spoiler went good
bent pin massive understatement haha looong time ago like 2004 finally saved enough money upgrade ancient pc didnt know buddy said build pc problem came helped put cpu socket athlon 64 3000 everything fine tried mount cooler wouldnt fit anyway tried push twist somehow nothing time trying lifted cooler magic cpu socket yeah turned cpu sticked cooler tried force place many way brushed cpu pin across socket almost half pin bent like hell also couple broken also managed kill motherboard save money another 10 month buy new stuff back 2020 build new system without gpu impossible get one finally got 3070 two month later excited ala turned wont fit pcie slot doesnt tried like 15 minute even put lot force nothing sad figured either faulty gpu maybe damaged transport faulty motherboard broken pcie something went put gpu box send back thats realized gpu still plastic cover pcie connector
didnt put mobo standoff cut io shield
cable tie anything could use cable management also didnt screwdriver forgot order thermal paste started put thing together also lack usb stick could install window wifi driver
plugged usb hub bios usb port hell broke loose every time upgrade build run b wasnt used paying attention
life connect fan right direction know plug motherboard think im stupid honestly
first time tried build pc found one company build pc buy individual component vague idea much wanted purchase part concept actually needed make computer work computer arrived wouldnt turn call company rep told power supply purchased wasnt big enough pc return pc part upgraded complained power supply wasnt big enough didnt someone contact sending power supply knew wasnt big enough part available purchase set wasnt big enough explained knew little pc building assumed part list provided adequate long story short got full refund brother law help build ordering amazon newegg let suggest part would work together feel like thing really wrong enough research picking part also feel like said truth part picker build computer thats whole thing building pc scratch niche warning power supply insufficient said took rep word
nothing really thats honest also everything kind worked
helped friend order part build pc college part arrived friday heading home weekend told could build together monday well got little impatient threw together managed get everything put together went turn zap yeah forgot standoff felt bad guy lol
thought gpu shoddy kept plugging monitor igpu
first build last time upgraded gpu cpu fan went well wouldnt boot window troubleshooted everything could think realized stick ram wasnt fully pressed place pressed heard click immediately started laughing
sure mistake pretty sure oh well put cpu cooler first time wasnt well put together remove put lost track cpu turn stuck cooler xd guess didnt secure cpu socket well enough
ive built dozen pc still starting built brother pc everything going well pressed button little spark pop smoke started coming case turn forgot plug cpu plug motherboard thankfully mobo fried everything else good got replacement day later first last time ive ever seen pc go flame lol
friend make first build call one simple issue motherboard old bios version yet support cpu work sit read manual flash bios usb stick without cpu manufacturer worst case find older cpu get bios update
didnt select boot drive couldnt life figure red light mobo
buying gpu facebook marketplace doesnt work
afraid bricked something static find havent connected power cable gpu
propperly seating cpu cooler 34 screw 4th one couldnt screw dont know decided 3 wouldnt cause much trouble left like month later replaced one amd stock coller one cooler master
shit psu came case
used old external hdd family picture window know worked 12 let say mom wasnt happy gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
issue building pc first time screw ssd nvme2 samsung one box mobo seem one either disaster good 30min untill decided watch bunch unboxing building pc video mobo realised small screw different small package promotion manual page mobo box would legit find ever
spending 500 ssd ram instead vram gpu
dumbest mistake building budget pc ended spending 2x much upgrading time saved little first got quality component right bat
didnt connect front panel switching pc touching pin metal touched motherboard z270 realeased burned
buying 80387 coprocessor chip go along 80386 cpu really need math coprocessor time 80386 would plenty
added graphic card thought purpose display bought cheapest card could hdmi using tv time hd 6670 quickly replaced
built first pc 2011 loved always felt better jump forward 2020 big tear reinstall noticed switch mb normally meant overlocking basically stunted cpu couldnt cook turn nine year 37ghz cpu operating max 07
connected external cooling fan wrong connector started pc rgbs fan popped fan still work quarter fan light permanently dark blue color
plugging psu cable installing case man fiddly
first powered pc aios kraken elite screen didnt turn thought cause needed download software something powered pc temp spiked nearly immediately trying debug pushed power cable pump little bit screen turned turn even powered cause connector loose
brother building first pc would turn dont know brother tough maybe switch psu help switched 220 v 110 v magic smoke discovered live europe got 220 v face expecting 110 time cheap
usb didnt use header block individual pin hooked one wrong im way booted literally caught fire burned usb header still worked otherwise though
first one built brother dont count built one month ago display took mc ram slot 3 4 v 2 4 hell know
got case fan side panel happened align directly air cooler remove fan entirely pointless gotten first place also immediately forgetting hardware turned worked instantly dumped information head fast forward 7 8 year idea could run modern game didnt know check
somehow killed 8700 bought 13900k
mistake ive seen vga cable inserted monitor jack screwed upsidedown coworker impressive strength first build case didnt come standoff couldnt find preweb google figured important something case mobo assembled pc layer foam conductive foam mobo shipped friend took repair shop never told outcome probably didnt want embarrass
forgot gpu clamp existed trying reseat gpu yanked entire slot motherboard luckily 2 equivalent slot plugged second one several year random pin sticking motherboard
buddy bent cpu pin like 3 hour straightening got work guess random weirdness pc guess attribute cpu pin bending suspect could something else good story try nitpick didnt bother trying give tech support haha
early 2000s component purchased online newegg afraid breaking something applying much force seating heatsink cpu ended sort resting top hit power heard pop watched soul cpu floated away small puff smoke think rmad half build question asked newegg awesome back day
taking apart clean prebuilt ended extra cable doesnt turn
spent extra bought 900w psu gon na cross fire 7970 ghz edition year use squeeze life cross fire sli got dropped never got
forced usb c cord motherboard upside gifemotefreeemotespackflipout
day thought broke pin cpu installation learn cpu never pin
well recent build spent hour troubleshooting display driver reseating gpu cleaning port etc second monitor would get picture matter hard tried turn bad displayport cable
got first pc december couple week ago bought pair presonus eris 35bt speaker great sounded great nice loud jamming guitar like week ago suddenly started stuttering lot couldnt figure searched tried many thing nothing worked thing changed recently installed fan hub pc also got set steelseries arctic wireless headphone figured headphone maybe interfering something know solution work pc installing fan hub unplugging everything removed wifi antenna figured use ethernet dont need idea also needed bluetooth screwed antenna back speaker work perfectly
build yesterday miswired power button connection nothing powering keyboard lighting knew mobo getting power overconfident dummy initially built inside case took everything built mobo box realized error take apart back case output monitor another 45min troubleshooting saw monitor power cable wasnt plugged thankful issue indeed user error
pulling 500w 500w supply never exploded probably single digit amount watt sounded like lawnmower heavy gaming seshes
20 year ago child pulled pentium 4 socket cooler thought could push back never saw much bend pin trusty hairdryer flathead screwdriver able fix never bend pin since
way back 2000when wasnt rgb glass side panel built computer forgot connect fan cpu air cooler computer worked perfectly fine one day opened cleaning 6 7 month later saw fan connected soon computer boot youd get thermal alert throttling minute
went mobo doesnt wifi bluetooth built regret decision
helped coworker troubleshoot first build cuz issue found screwed mobo straight case without using standoff
didnt consider cable management space selected case made build 10x frustrating needed
got obsessed looking sale deal probably spent month researching different component searching best value pc totally fine last 10 year couple gpu upgrade along way probably wasnt worth spending much time researching signing deal alert save 200 buck total
long ago would sell case power supply remember janky diablotek psu blow didnt know better kid enjoying first custom build extremely fortunate didnt take component sure smelled like burnt electronics idea diagnosed issue something eventually told buy new psu sure enough hooking everything pc alive
forgot plug power button everything perfect except power button panicked good 10 minute trying figure wouldnt work felt like total genius
plugging power button probably also least forgot plug power cable cpu
0 cable management first build
installed cooler bracket way wasnt able secure peerless assassin forgot plug 24 pin panicked pc wasnt turning
got shitty case bad airflow r5 3600 1080ti sweating bullet inside please spare headache get mesh front intake case side size least 2 120mm fan
forgot take little bracket installing cooler left tiniest gap cpu didnt notice thing would shut 15 second luckily found problem quickly haha
motherboard doesnt support usb3 front panel connector usb2 front panel usb lol
futureproofing build ended upgrade cpu gpu mobo later
installed cpu cooler fan blowing away heatsink took figure cpu ran hot even idle
noctua cpu fan stuck case allowed couldnt close glass pane properly 1 tb space ran within 4 game properly quality control check monitor found dead pixelsback light bleeding return exchange use xmp profile ram stick
biggest regret trying build low budget gave 600 dollar thought would enough build something could least run game wanted fast forward around year already cant run stalker 2 basically unreal engine 5 game struggle really hard
forgot io plate forgot remove cpu sticker remembered quickly due multitude image using modular psu used wrong psu port videocard cable
ensuring pushed am4 cpu fully mobo taking repaste installing cooler shitting wouldnt boot
first pc build recent one power button seamlessly integrated case design literally didnt see mashing rgb light button wondering wouldnt power triple checked connection reseated everything looked diagram case make sure header plugged right noticed power button thought
plugged pc case power button fan wrong haha couldnt start pc wondering read manual mobo
getting prebuilt instead custom
buying mobo cpu compatible
everyone forgets psu switch didnt forgot press power button case dont know thats better worse
tried work powered touched audio chip metal zapped use sound card lol
installed latest window 11 update shut connected android phone via usb turned pc gainward rtx 3060 fan running output sure killed rtx left preowned gt 710 cant cry enough shelled cash preowned setup
havent built pc year missed io plate forgot take cover vga port think know mean im always nervous hell cpu install managed get paste underside cpu luckily side could wipe continue surprisingly front usb always managed get one go
mean putting psu upside seems tough mess ive done least twice
bought 487 coprocessor go 386 cpu got work though socket compatible 487 returned result cpu 386 ready ended cutting motherboard trace soldering delay line timing would work
im older first time getting case fried whole thing cost 2700 fix inflation adjust dollar wore grounding strap fried another motherboard lazy early 2000s grounding cant hurt
network driver window wifi lost ethernet wasnt working still dont understand happened since window usually come generic driver
biggest mistake son made following crowd mentality watching review understanding process important still need check need could saved time money would gotten endless rabbit hole better future proof pleased built didnt realize longer path went assessed build enjoy process fun problem solving frustrating happening really appreciate solved issue know build feel lot accomplished good luck
plugging monitor motherboard hdmi instead gpu lmaooo
added gpu didnt know activate bios msi lga 775 window xp
plugging cpu power
forgot plug simply mobo power cord lol
bought wrong connector wifi instead mhf4 bought ufl connector slightly bigger pin adapter causing didnt clamp kept coming
io plate second build
back elementary school knew needed uprade graphic card play game better setting around time graphic card started sometimes additional power pin required psu went passively cooled gpu realize two type common slot gpus agpwhich pciewhich gpu well quite disappointed found
forgot remove protective film cooler wondered ran hot bit
bought part help friend done hitting buy button decided change psu much cheaper one brand probably invented make single oosu fine year buy new motherboard cpu addition psu blew spent three year much worse cpu money tight overspent fancy psu avoid issue
first pc built joy use went budget grabbing 7800x3d 9800 wasnt yet 4070tis gpu 6000mhz ram gigabyte x670 mobo fully modular power supply putting together threw monitor plugged keyboard mouse prayed screen came bios thanked god noticed temp cpu touch high started getting higher pc shut terrified thought either defective unit air cooler wasnt sufficient triple checked connection tried thing power high temp steadily rising shutoff didnt want throw power knew happening cpu cooler clearly support bracket correctly paste spreading albiet much yeah make sure check exactly cooler supposed mounted mine barely touching transferring basically heat felt like giant doofus remove plastic applied proper amount paste least shame doesnt help isnt making contact fixed temp steady around 30 celcius mark sigh relief engaged
picture 2005 online building guide website ancient helpful youtube doesnt really good tutorial yet either resource instruction manual came case motherboard manual badly translated chinese english two biggest first time mistake install standoff bracket came case instruction said nothing could figure front panel power connector manual vague go motherboard ended take shop take look able get fixed quickly showed screwed
tried add gpu dell optiplex sent gpu back working turn turn legacy rom turn secure boot bios
building first x86 amd computer 1998 believe amdk5pr75 turned computer junkie dumbest mistake money could saved
many time ive performed maintenance gaming rig forgot plug power back gpu wondered screen blank post
installed cpu cooler without removing protective sticker
plugging hdmi motherboard gpu took 40 staring blank screen wondering computer wont work
didnt get ram seated ram speckle
knowing better getting cheap psu also buying case proprietary fan connector fortunately psu hasnt blown yet im looking solving soon case fan ill give case brother whenever want build new pc
pcpartpicker selected hyte y70 instead y60 hakos bae case led liquid freezer 3 compatible ended corsair titan rx added rx fan side intake got sale worth end
chose used motherboard amazon didnt work didnt made building mistake though
didnt plug psu cable way took figure one
didnt seat ram way would start booting continue first build wound taking shop really embarrassed found
didnt seat ram way would start booting continue first build wound taking shop really embarrassed found
mounted cpu coolerfan wrong way rip whole thing already thermal paste required much force thought going destroy cpu
first build forgot plug 8 pin pci gpu couple week ago concerned done cpu psu swap concerned messed something got display mid troubleshoot saw werent plugged cable managed clip zip tie lol
needing update graphic driver way see anything
didnt plug 24pin connector way couldnt figure pc kept rebooting random interval
bought sff case cant fit fan besides aio
buying 1080 600 dollar 2021
turned pc got video audio forgot connect 8pin power gpu
wrong form factor mobo case ended without rig 2 week cuz mistake
recent build put fan backwards phantom spirit version bought different others logo side push air pushing warm air case without anything pumping noticed temp bit high fixed dropped 10 degree one thing rather proud using barbecue lighter see way air flowing
forgot 1 standoff one right gpu slot gpu didnt seat correctly pc still kinda worked unusable thing build night huge lan despite getting lot help didnt find issue hour went home pc worked flawlessly 30 minute got back home fixed issue
hdmi cable mobo even tho gpu xd
connected cpu fan pin rgb stripe motherboard close thought place wrong soon turned pc fan working frontal one 3 second died felt stupid person earth since thought fried whole computer fortunately nothing happened switched cable right place worked like charm never problem 45 year
forgot io plate forgot take blue plastic film ssd heat sink forgot standoff didnt know plug front connector name
every 3rd computer build io panel installed forgot
thanks sending memory lane trying see could remember first pc build im going guess late 80 around 10 frankensteining together old part would hoard bedroom closet instead letting dad throw away remember one early junk build paradise brand graphic card tough get working came tshirt cheesy beach graphic paradise logo dont know happened shirt regret losing track day let call first big pcbuilding mistake
ran first custom loop year sticker cpu block
fan blowing wrong direction
dont remember first time long ago get regret buying hardware first place 1 week 1 month new better gpu cpu come make mine look like toaster ive prone upgrading every 2 year less im holding ive yet made 1 year im tempted upgrade addiction
realize motherboard standoff essential component build purposely ignored thinking cosmetic thing people wanted interior look nice computer wouldnt even boot dismantle 80 build get installed
first pc build gpu wrong slot year boy feel stupid figured wonder game crashed almost constantly
building small form factor suffering get everything fit build wire zip tied place realized never plugged power switch disassembled whole computer placed cable terminal took around hour dice still turning troubleshot 3 hour went bed returned following day took apart start metering stuff discovered power button connector plugged backwards
getting voodoo 5 birthday month went business meant updated driver back actually needed updated driver even run new game community driver eventually got ati 9700 instead
plugged 5v pin 12v fortunately rgbs
used amd fx8350 save buck immediately performance issue almost every modern game crazy far amd come since
bent almost pin cpu rip pentium 4
first time building pc everything good go first boot met error slotted ram incorrectly okay problem well took hr 4am trouble shootin swapping ram pc would turn id get display tried every single ram slot variation using 1 stick everything find first swapped ram mustve slightly unplugged gpu power thats display probably started first guild midnight lol year later reddit saved another minor issue took week trouble shooting take pc repair store mouse stutter constantly tried everything new mouse pad new mouse tried old mouse different pc worked fine issue seemed pc reinstalled window driver everything could think turn mouse stutter caused slightly loose hdmi cord going 2nd monitor everything worked fine mouse funny thing didnt find reddit post talking loose hdmi cord caused mouse stutter probably would never found issue take pc repair store issue would resolved unplugging everything take pc
didnt consider size case relation size video card tight fit unscrew shift gpu cooler odd position make work basically wasnt coming back time replace made damn sure new pc issue p
went itxhttpscapcpartpickercombyx4d4d cable management hell room proper cpu cooling specific order put everything together definitely didnt follow took entire day build computer dont learn hard mode kid
actually recent second build dumbest plugged front io cable case com pin front io pin troubleshooted almost hour realizing much idiot first build mostly marred knowing much tension ram slot cpu door needed
paying attention interrupt request available motherboard comparing expansion card got everything work modem dip switch small selection interrupt none available motherboard basically incompatible understood sure schedule colonoscopy year
yep forgot standoff first time friend teaching let make mistake told wrong noticed thing werent lining forgot io shield time also forgot buy thermal paste twice run best buy time
put cpu cooler tr p 120 se wrong orientation 180 degree still seemed fit gpu though turned around regardless
making sure case right size pc part picker said would fine building could life get cpu cooler nzxt one little screen end putting cooler front case instead top cooler setup funky take panel front hut work measure twice
broke every little leg io plate didnt understand push bit motherboard better one upgrading o drive sata ssd nvme somehow installed window weirdest way possible boot part still old ssd o nvme ssd die im fucked die isnt connected exactly happened upgraded cpu recently discovered much ive fucked x
strangely mistake time tried build friend mine pc didnt check everything fitted told check forgot lol ended mounting aio rad front rather top
didnt realize hard snap ram place wound seating correctly going nut trying figure wouldnt work took two day one tech savvy friend spent hour facetime suddenly asked properly seated told lean really push heard snap sound soon presto
didnt cable manage cable sticking body case
plugging something realizing
forgot plug gpu power supply wondering computer wasnt posting like 2 hr
installed fan backward fan pulling air case found month later layer dust outside case getting pulled
would put fan slot pentium 3 whatever since cpu encased hard plastic need actively cooled luckily kept shutting didnt melt completely
didnt used spacers mobo case puff
case wasnt large enough gpu wait another week one show
well let see first time problem month ago let see took cover cpu mobo interface bent 3 pin like n00b tiny tweasers magnifying glass hour somehow missed fan slot put last one kept mobo booting thought fried cpu turn didnt plug cable first slot pretty dumb mistake
buddy completed first build wasnt able go help day got part hed gotten everything done hooking psu installing gpu head help wrap plug aaaaand nothing figure maybe dvi hdmi try cord without success even run home grab another cord long story short ram wasnt seated fully
research
initial build upgrading gpu first time ripped entire pcie slot plugged new gpu next slot surprisingly ill effect lol
realising graphic card second power plug need
plugged cable psu came without checking one actually needed installed everything tried figure everything went realized clogging thing making cable management impossible took everything started took like hour figure lol
11 shorted mobo 13 deleted window wouldnt boot hell bent bin build last year luckily bent back
plugged sata cable upside silverline psu blew hard drive
couldnt figure computer kept turning second smartphones didnt good way debugging either eventually accidentally found probing unseated part cpu burned learned cpu need cooler
friend spread thermal paste inside pc frosting cake
thought first pc broken didnt know install driver motherboard smart kid
watch build guide verge
instantly burned brand new cpu happened back early 2000 athlon64 didnt thermal damage protection whatsoever forgot properly secure cooler created tiny gap cooler cpu turned power instantly smelled burned electronics buy new cpu learned important lesson day
power supply screw wrong one friend thought friend help u demanded 200 dollar helping
immense amount paranoia building first one triple checked every move made build took damn near 11 hour worth since everything put together lasted solid 9 year counting problem mistake made minor one hit power button checked cpu fan make sure everything good noticed cpu fan barely turning immediately powered everything check connection tried turn cpu fan looked like barely rotating lighting put direct light could see fan full speed
lmao ive built thousand pc weekend almost issue power switch power bar flipped
2003 building intel northwood processor cpu required separate 4pin 12v connector power beyond 20pin atx connector provided read manual thoroughly noted completely forgot building pc would turn strain eg running neverwinter night wasted summer figuring time rmad cpu motherboard genuinely believed hardware fault
friend mine built pc helped pick part first build back 2011 dont know uncommon didnt want pay modular power supply didnt get one regretted extra cable case pain case wasnt built cable management build bluray drive moved drive lower case could shove unused cable cable slack gap top case drive second thing case year case fan would rattle one hard drive one video card issue assumed fan dying replaced still rattled id smack side case every time rattled would stop
first time went well forgot plug power connector 1070 either specific bios message insufficient power gpu figured 30 second second time hell time hand couldnt get driver including networking driver importantly work installing window 25 day later realized using window install drive 2016 old made new installation key problem went away
using 2 pcie cable daisy chaining 3080 working fine first month started display issue bought new 850w psu replace 750w psu thinking problem realize needed 3 separate pcie cable plugged learned internet coworker issue
moved cpu tad bit mounting didnt lift turned bent bunch pin mobo
forgot snap little bar lock cpu turned case upright cooler installed yet cpu plopped broke
decade ago one many standoff forgot leave one based motherboard called touching component back motherboard checked removed pc fired lasted quite long life
switched reset ground cable case causing one dont remember catch fire
cheap smart like dad sorted cheap needed play game wanted bought accordingly shit obsolete really fast lowspecgaming community bigger test buy cheap go obsolete immediately cheap expensive guy
forgot io shield didnt plug cpu power cable remembered turn power supply switch though forgot turn outlet wall couldnt figure wouldnt boot
letting 2 friend help knew everything came together fast fast forward 10 year realized idea confident set aside lot less time needed super easy right hand learn either way big deal
would light output time assumed bad motherboard got replacement im pretty sure didnt push ram far enough first one lol 100 like least 70
thought mine broken cause flipped psu switch nothing happened keyboard turning got ta hit power button mb dur
got intel cpu instead amd
first pc long time ago probably setting jumper correctly irq drive master slave set course didnt start building system spending year frankenstein rebuilds existing prebuilds hdd ram upgrade gained lot experience beforehand
help teacher first time built computer nothing crazy went however ago tried insocket upgrade new processor wouldnt work updated bios old processor without putting cooler upgraded platform last year put motherboard noticed would break bracket case one soldered one already put motherboard could life remove pull motherboard
window kept crashing install took 3 hour figure put 1 ram chip installing window put 2nd
forgot pull sticker part cpu cooler connects cpu wondering cpu got hot started stuttering high load fortunately fixed couple day damage yet
thought switching psu actually turning cried went bed woke realized pressed power switch powered right oh forgot click ssd place properly confused window wouldnt install gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
going mini itx didnt space constraint putting pc made difficult upgrade road due interior space constraint limited selection component
think stripping mobo screw pc case thankfully pretty inconsequential
plugging monitor io instead gpu classic streamed building twitch show friend issue
first second stupidly forgot remove protective plastic top cpu installed cooler never started computer still waiting addition part night lying bed strangest feeling fd stupidly left plastic even though knew watching many installation video got next day inspected work sure enough could see tab plastic cover sticking cooler thankfully thats dumbest thing ive done far
wouldnt post two hour troubleshooting later found ram wasnt seated way
literally built saturday booted first time patted back took look creation realised cpu cooler upside work fine upsidedown artctic logo starting bother
picked amd system
upgraded gtx 1080 3080 upgrading rig fitting wouldnt boot properly checked everything started troubleshooting concluded 3080 faulty went customer service site bought spent age chatting person online decided send back shop twice took 2 week tested said fine working properly transported rig cousin house verdict turn didnt plug 2nd psu cable 3000 series need assumed required 1 like 1080 gaming friend circle still crack joke day
choosing cool gamer case chose cool zalman z11 case turned bitch clean sidepanel fan died year
old one first pc built amd pr75 cpu upgraded cyrix p133 couldnt even install window 95 thing kept crashing install process tried going back window 31 fine everyone still using do game anyway eventually something really wanted win95 started playing around see problem discovered worked fine changed core voltage 34v instead recommended 33v still dont know operated fine 16bit software 32bit oh another old one atx form factor power switch pc used directly attached psu switch completing circuit main current flowed testing part psu removed case picked switch without noticing plastic sleeving covered bare terminal slipped flicked 240v across hand cant say enjoyed much
way back old day fancy sound werent built motherboard generic sb clone wanted connect motherboards speaker sound card hear better somehow plugged wrong wire melted smoked reading fine manual told speaker header sound card connection motherboard internal speaker
idk mistake really dumb moment haha built first pc month ago motherboard got didnt support cpu box told tried bios flash thing anything else got flash drive renamed file stuck hit button flashed like 2 second turned every video watched said would take minute scared messed tried ton thing like hour girlfriend getting upset wasting time since building pc together stopped moved fast forward first boot everything worked fine recognized cpu im still sure worked lied im relieved run amazingly
think common mistake building first pc setting jumper right wondering piece shit computer booting oh forgot set jumper
buying superdiskls120 coming completely wasted money could gotten vanta much better performance 8mb permedia ii video card landed
worst mistake made getting motherboard sata port lol
screwed motherboard directly case fair first ever time building pc obviously mistake like ever repeated though forget power switch least every time build pc
spent 2 hour trying figure light pc wasnt turning never plugged monitor
extremely sick severe mental fog excited finally build forgot motherboard spacers screwed mobo directly case smelled exactly like imagine tried fire
spending extra money motherboard pci isa slot instead getting cheaper pcionly board putting extra money toward better modem
plug cpu psu cable gpu
didnt put motherboard standoff wondering wouldnt fit lol tbf dumb reason every tutorial watched decided mention step luckily realized something wasnt right didnt force screw
wired jfp1 incredibly wrong pc would boot took pc repair shop moved connector around booted straight away issue pc 10 year
ram wrong slot go computer shop get laughed
put cheap wireless card build confused internet speed horrible turn antenna provided absolutely horrible moved router closer used different antenna good go sometimes start easiest step forgot
aio fan pulling case instead pushing lol
built first pc everything went exactly planned save fighting intels really stupid snap stud system laminar stock cooler watch video unblock one easy enough though literally thing perfect wouldnt give display everything posted everything good everything everything fact gpu wasnt plugged thought 3060 ti sli port turn port pcie power issue adding another hard drive scratching head second switched disk boot priority problem solved know enough build second pc
installing lian li tl lcd fan upside assuming werent powering defective moronic design though honestly shouldnt able connect power supply cord wrong end definitely otherwise flawless victory shau khan status first build
using shitty component
vetting brand enough even certain marketplace almost gave hobby getting burned tigerdirect thats one young one might ever heard
forgot order thermal paste ordered waited arrive found cpu cooler came preapplied thermal paste
bought cheap gpu cuz blower model didnt know gon na loud af drown audio even headphone xx always gon na get 3 fan model
20 year ago forgot use standoff completely killed motherboard cpu somehow fine less expensive lesson might
couldnt figure gpu wouldnt fit thought incompatible mobonope forgot take little pcie protective thingy
forgot plug cooler pin thought mobo failing detecting cooler
didnt know motherboard standoff actually 2nd build first pc raised motherboard mount new case didnt idea put little standoff shorted board right
rgb fan werent working correctly tried everything except software update
first 2 pc went smooth third aio plugged fan header right next cpu fan header sooooo much trouble shooting realized stupid mistake
didnt use standoff motherboard working fine couple year didnt
put 1070 pcie 1x slot couldnt figure graphic looked poor year
brother spazzing monitor wasnt working plugged hdmi mobo
forgot put standoff case couldnt understand wouldnt boot brought tech expert work figured pretty much immediately thankfully nothing fried much likely back second pc build though friend felt extra bad
starting budget build going full stupid halfway buying part twice isnt fun sound like
1st crack idea standoff frank memory little fuzzy pre2000 remember mobo would flop somehow side case shorting stuff anyways mad dumb eventually someone explained standoff b mobo flopping side case bad bad bad got eventually attempt 2 god know second crack understood idea standoff short took thing far looking standoff saw metal case metal standoff forming circuit back board went overkill making sure screw board insulated passing voltage quite kind problem shit dying inside pc cause standoff supposed offer ground static go case psu wall could write book stupid shit pre2k didnt want anywhere near stuff
forgot motherboard riser wouldnt turn like pulled board weird way figured happening lmao
oh let see bought pentium 4 clear move athlon 64 bought dual gpu motherboard didnt support sli bought inferior graphic card immediately paid much replacement best buy
didnt happen first build one time applied much thermal paste seeped onto motherboard month
one case fan plugged socket thats behind gpu know monumentally important hub back solitary little guy life head rent free
used thought plastic standoff ended breaking 6 month use 2nd pc put together spent hour trying figure wouldnt post ignorance assumed either cpu motherboard would able post bios without graphic card installed wrong
first pc built always ran really hot desk always assumed finally built new pc 4 year later forgot another year new build come back old desktop set living room open find exhaust fan came case never plugged 5 year later finally found ran hot
forgot ram ordered every single part would need except damn ram 10 year ago friend still bring fact forgot order ram clearly need better memory
computer one fan command stripped replacing part year ago lost screw something genuinely cant remember hasnt bitten yet time tell
bent cpu pin fortunately able bend back straighten plier
thought installed front header connection correctly spent 30 minute getting frustrated worried broke something thankfully easy embarrassing fix
thinking buck naked anti static strap wrist building didnt short anything second explaining wife needed buck naked kitchen carpet build
dumbest mistake upgrading cooler old am4 build bent pin 5600x damaged socket removing old air cooler knew better still managed pull feat plus side kid able upgrade build spare component plan use remaining part na
ram stick right next
back 2016 changing cpumotherboard new one somehow thought would genius set carpet floor shocked completely killed brand new board gotten lol
forgot cpu power cable
dont even remember first pc build guess mistake taking photo would well digital photo thing maybe earliest pc build remember gigantic dualpentium tower spent way much money probably around 19961997 zero recollection record built never bought premade dell gateway anything like also dont remember buying motherboard chassis separately
went reddit advice kidding course bought upgrade kit unsupported ram am5 build super unstable 5600mhz till day rocking 4800mhz
ive built one pc everything ready go two cable motherboard switched around didnt turn eventually figured glass case exploded granite tile counter
dumbest mistake made going full rgb saw robey build white lian li xl blinded color
cheaped processor got cyrix instead pentium dont ever buy fastest current cpu ill never buy slowest ever
small bean installing aio making sure psu connection made annoying
upgrade wife pc new ram graphic card went boot kept restarting didnt set ram way happens
bought triple channel build sticked ram next enabled xml 4 year latest mistake bending little metal io plate hole
accounting case size future graphic card upgrade microsoft atx great dont plan upgrading man atx case give better airflow allows flexibility graphic card
taking 4 hour lmao forgot io shield 3rd one got overconfident moved fast lol
going rgb build pretty good job may say adhd turn flashing blinking spinning light corner eye unbearably distracting even solid stationary color ended much spent fair amount turn day never use
bought case thought looked cool button top pressed make front panel slowly slide open reveal drive powerreset button really cool week slowly got sick waiting thing move broke panel next build utilitarian antec case solid airflow filter easy access io undersized build used case next three personal pc im getting rid want usbc port front panel
bad backplate mount aio wouldnt provide solid contact blockcpu temperature issue lived year thinking system ran hot aware problem denial far dumbest building mistake end getting different aio give issue
put riser wrong spot shorted mobo
accidentally bought ddr ram instead ddr2 kinda new time didnt know different
putting io shield ever lol
old psu two switch one power 2nd one eco mode turned eco mode switch trying figure pc would turn
psu somehow set 120v 240v switch back im ukdid go well
1st ever cpu motherboard dx4 cpu put cpu board didnt boot panic went actual repair shop looked turn inserted cpu wrong way everything ok tho laughed
biggest mistake ignorant extraneously testing 8tb hardrive bought amazon beforehand drive completely died long purchasing lost lot data thinking new would fine ironically new drive worry building pc fairly easy though make sure read manual come purchase youll straight
buying super expensive case time around 140 2014 pretty expansiv case time like buy 200 case today mean big nice clean think simpler one would bean ok yea know 120 case isnt much want wall mounted one one optionbrand
20 year ago powered pc find main power source motherboard wasnt plugged psu properly
sticker came amd cpu back day thick sticker come cpu right put cpu attached heatsink even lying never noticed problem cpu werent hot back
dumbest mistake made building first pc thats easy buying seagate barracuda hard drive immediately replacing despite recall list 2008s recall thinking oh theyre recall list fine joke still bricked even though werent part recall list break magically added recall list id already lost data never buy seagate product ever youve lost customer never ever buy product ever lived forever would never buy product ever
mucking cooler master 212 evo use stock intel cooler picked 212 black edition
done building started first try flat thing still box oh mr io shield well shit spent 15minutes convincing self need io shield back offk
ive ever built one pc scratch friend mine bought component afraid tackle thing messed power reset button got backwards somehow lol several minute hitting power button nothing happening eventually hit reset button hell powered right would easy fix didnt care left way early 20 pretty proud pride increased little year later guy bought stuff build way better pc instead letting put together another friend dude master degree something computer related maybe im guessing thats chose guy forgot one corner mb standoff point went install something made loud popcracking noise stopped went back installed standoff im pretty sure late im remembering correctly pc never worked right replace mb even get running doubt guy surely way knowledge came pc go show even someone master degree still make rookie mistake guess ill find still im getting ready put together son pc
20 year ago 15 16 gotten first paycheck working student job whole month july part ordered uncle going help put together come gpu wouldnt fit bought pcie card motherboard agp didnt know difference uncle didnt see everything together could go store return mom went store best angry mom ranting guy refunded card gave agp one instead thinking back gone different motherboard pcie instead first pc used couple year time upgrade since agp card longer made also overclocked hard cpu burnt motherboard end lifetime month ago found old case good memory old nzxt case basically looked like power ranger
destroyed cpu didnt understand zif socket worked snapped least dozen pin bent rest dont think single pin left untouched time done defense eight thought knew
spent like whole day troubleshooting first pc figure image realize wasnt supposed plug monitor motherboard

overspending ram faster mobo could handle overspending mobo feature never used lifetime overspending case tell upgrade ok overspend actually would sick sight time upgrade buy new one
plugging atx power mobo correctly one pin wasnt making contact felt special tech micro center pointed
first pc build hdmi cable hooked motherboard instead gpu bit mental breakdown thinking broke something realized felt dumb

didnt mount aio correctly pc would immediately shut post spent 2 hour tearing pc thinking something short feeling residual heat motherboard pcb cpu overheating finally noticed mistake building pc fun sometimes downright torture
didnt know different ram like ddr2 ddr3 bought part new computer set ddr2 ram got super excited unboxed everything started building realize ddr2 fit ddr3 ram slot wait week amazon deliver new set ddr3 ram
didnt realize motherboard cpu pin slightly bent design since got used freaked tried bending straight broke buy another one top trying use cheaper test model cpu didnt work get another original cpu
first pc one time another forgot io shield remembered io shield forgot check little metal ground finger right place sliding motherboard got caught io header bent front port blocked repurposing older motherboard new machine cleared cmos using jumper removing battery forgot move jumper back got motherboard hair tightening installing gpu display port close edge slot couldnt get video cable
didnt push ram way thought build broke friend pointed fairly teased good hour afterwards
first build pentium massive spark melt power cord giant blue flame dad watching thought bury great laugh fortunately fixed problem put new cord ran fine lately messing rgb cable bent lga pin latest faux pa
ive built whole pc without testing part beforehand broken motherboard fully unbuild system pain as

deleting system32 got computer consequently building got hand hp pavilion started going folder thinking could delete unnecessary file rebooted bricked went best buy buy window xp install cd got fresh start whatever reason really got tinkering point since built dozen pc family friend
preparing build kept seeing dont forget flip power switch absolutely forget flip power switch psu imac 8 year one power button didnt think press button front case well built twice outside case inside took shop said couldnt find issue turned right nice build charged 100 dollar turning pc might charged less didnt realize got home
didnt fully insert ram posted unstable like installing anything troubleshooting guide said update driver first literally couldnt took 3 frustrating hour blue screen death one restarts left debug led long enough figure
forgot io plate chose massive pc case reason cable management complete garbage
really high decided assemble everything popped cpu socket forgot lock stuck heat sink fan bent every pin cpu started sliding around neighbor painting figurine massive magnifying glass fucking dude bent every pin back straight popped back finished build worked 2007 still work day
ive done first build everything fine including thermal paste point working cable order hyte y40 5 phanteks m25 gen 2 argb fan one normal one using linq6 adapter 2 argb header two fan header
didnt route power cpu power 2 internet seemed divided whether needed also realized wrong psu wire going gpu needed remove motherboard switch wire two change worked perfectly
happened third pc finished building completely including giant noctua air cpu cooler put together im ready plug forgot put io shield way get without taking air cooler redo thermal paste bent shiny thing plier fit doesnt look amazing fine dont put io plate soon dont wait youre ready actually use io
example 1 using flat head screwdriver assist attaching cpu fan clip slipped took capacitor motherboard example 2 managed put ddr3 ram backwards powered south bridge chip burned almost immediately first experience electrical fire smell like
forgot standoff motherboard fried everything 30 year ago didnt dare year tower come built standoff
everything went well actually week someone notified there plastic film inside glass panel
dumbest mistake ive made overall first build 1012 year ago absolutely destroyed usb3 header front panel heard component pushed force instead checking make sure pin lined pushed harder eventually broke probably couldve survived without front panel usb3 bought new motherboard anyway dumbest mistake made recent build plugging power button
built first pc didnt really mess anything somehow unlucky enough get bad am3 motherboard bad psu confirmed testing friend part spent 2 day troubleshooting luck got friend bring working pc test part bunch combination realized 1 part defective im glad havent bad luck since lol also upgraded current pc got ryzen 3600x friend tried install pc wouldnt boot turn cpu bent pin didnt bother check pin installing idea bent friend gave brother able unbend pin ive never removed cpu since lol
shitty power supply shorted hour installation tripped breaker 3 time barrack realized going
didnt really mess build ordered part living campus excited got delivered noticei sprinted across campus get part moment knew messed walk huge box part including pc case back dorm bear hugged box might embarked journey felt like 4hrs back room tired finally made sat everything took nap course forgot connect video card power first boot started freaking looked side glass saw obvious screw im glad didnt ruin anything shaking part went
misplacing phillips head screwdriver
building single problem month later wouldnt show image going everywhere trying troubleshoot happened combination factor actually 1 main monitor plugged broken displayport broken enough recognized broken enough make monitor go crazy blinking red green blue black white straight signal message 2 second monitor still plugged would throw message saying signal 3 order troubleshoot bought motherboard speaker would sometimes troubleshooting process throw 1 long beep 3 rapid fire beep indicating ram issue might expect together pia nothing soon unplugged dp second monitor said hi something display
bought intel cpu amd mobo luckily cousin let know could cancel lmao
scared push memory stick way tried troubleshoot month rebuilt clicked right
back day motherboards came tiny speaker diagnostic beep didnt bother putting turned pc wouldnt post without took quite figure
weirdly none
building pc guess going looooonnnggggg checklist hahahaha
pinched fan cable case port motherboard didnt notice done building done cable still fan work nothing blocked
knew monitor display cable connect directly gpu couldnt find gpu port gpu connected monitor motherboard instead obviously didnt work spent hour troubleshooting discovering gpu perfectly usable port covered socket protector apparently smarter toddler
think issue plugged monitor gpu using hdmi wouldnt display screen switch dp idea time
even building first pc last year im nearly 50 rushed i7 11700 installation boxing day wondered retention lever wasnt going way cpu wasnt properly plenty bent pin socket tried best fix tweezer bin motherboard worst bit timing wait another 2 day another board felt proper waste 100 carelessness
back day swapped p8 p9 plug spent next couple hour trying figure couldnt get signal
standoff idea supposed use got lucky learned damaging anything
flipping negative positive power switch connector mobo pc kept power cycling took hour calling buddy figure haha last weekend another build experience knew immediately
io plate first 2 remembered hard stuff easiest thingjust forgot
spent day throubleshotting pc build would turn would restart loop forever took apart several time find pin atx power supply would go way
forgot thermal paste cpu initial problem display getting recognised random shut down
gifted nice pc decided upgrade keeping motherboard 800 later nice 8 year old pc maxed also first time putting gpu tried pull back realign tore pcle slot find old used motherboard fit old spec piece
thing psu switch first build took 15 minute figure
many moon ago spent day troubleshooting new system recognizing hard drive realize hadnt setup masterslave jumper correctly
first pc recent one thought hardware issue install window 11 kept black screening midway tried reinstall window five time course afternoon trying troubleshoot myriad potential issue along way turn hdmi switch flipping channel equally pissed also relieved found dreading hardware fault
wasnt hardware issue machine turned posted first try wouldnt load bios finally said eff roll dice booted window install thumb drive fine much later finally realized problem faulty assumption machine would boot bios without keyboard input cause o board got bios ez pz
used tv monitor plugged hdmi cord mobo hdmi slot instead gpu freaked video signal oh psu switch course
tried put hdd drive interior case put mobo innicked capacitor somehow ruined big lesson learned lol
dragged case building across thick carpet bricked board cpu go back ancient pc pulled dumpster another month
first pc build screwed motherboard directly metal case rathet little metal screw riser hit powet would run 1 second short instantly power back 2004 place like youtube even existed kind winged since sell previous dell prebuilt pc get enough money build one access internet anyway want pc shop bought part showed super friendly told wrong 30 second looking shout sw electronics tucson
plugged power supply cable motherboard backwards atx improved standard couldnt
tried turn pc cpu heatsink pc would turn right away forced power fried cpu
much building part purchasing thing bought x570 mobo wish would gone b550 instead dont really get much value extra stuff x570 brings upgraded anything way thought would ram kind waste money hey work like pc dont sweat
back ide day set jumper back hard drive order detect properly well messed around completely forgot later plugged everything could get boot reinstall window drive took whole day could search problem internet
booted bios thought pc unresponsive forgot plug mouse keyboard
alright think contender mid 2000s junior high maybe technically second pc ever built first time friend helped first time im solo im super excited got everything together fire computer start smell burning turn right away try figure smell coming power supply seems ok hard drive good gpu issue smell coming cpu run dad ask help take apart although remembered thermal paste put wrong side cpu best clean cpu socket board melted bit kept around number year remind failure honestly dont know didnt fry cpu thing ran probably decade
gpu didnt fit case
tightening screw accidentally scratching motherboard trace leaving option warranty rejected buy brand new x570 gaming plus motherboard best lesson learnt thru hard miserable way still mobo work kept backup whatever happens happens reason
thinking everything would work first time
didnt know cpu needed power cable
absolute braindead moment day ago got new cpu cooler wanted clean old thermal paste cpu ryzen 7 saw dust am5 socket thought clean cpu pin am5 socket shouldnt pin either took cloth alcohol started rubbing socket took second realize socket small pin yeah many bent lol tried bend position hour mainboards dead lol
didnt make mistake building one drop entire 1100 euro saving brand new spanky pc pc world 2016 thought fkn gpu instead intel graphic hadnt sausage left bought use cpu render feckin intel graphic 8 month gaming could save gtx 1060 build
classic connecting hdmi motherboard instead gpu
think must bad dvi cable pc wouldnt boot reseated every component tried different ram spent good 6hrs trying figure kick used hdmi cable everything booted right back day didnt even need monitor hooked pc boot
friend got new component new computer mom installed everything worked fine heard metallic ping sound inside computer started smelling like something burning didnt secure cpu cooler properly popped brand new thunderbird cpu got fried think 13 something time idea
biggest mistake ended buying 800 watt brand psu im thinking think brand powerup power amd athlon x2 5000 black edition 9600 gt mostly sale tiger directs psu calculator recommended much wattage also cheaped motherboard ended getting biostar board around 50 ended problem part retrospect probably gotten lower wattage psu reputable brand higher quality motherboard motherboard ended failing around 69 month id turn pc would appear start fan running light picture would appear screen ended replacing board foxconn recommended friend friend werent aware terrible working condition foxconn time 2008 otherwise probably would gone something else foxconn board never quit though psu hand minor problem could turned much bigger problem hadnt noticed year half originally building system reached desk behind pc try blindly plug usb cable instead finding usb port hand grazed metal exhaust fan grate psu top mounted fan grate hot nearly burnt finger recoiled pain turn fan psu burnt none heat dissipated could turned pc used small hot plate wanted hot could done serious cooking thing fan grille little tech savvy experienced time probably could replaced fan inside psu hearing potential capacitor discharge opted replace psu entirety thing seriously fire hazard im probably lucky none capacitor exploded pc didnt catch fire ended replacing ultra lsp650 worked fine dont think made major mistake friend built pc helped put everything together definitely helped definitely wouldnt installed standoff otherwise
first forgot tighten screw cpu cooler took 3 second popped buy new cpu
ive built hundred one thing almost always happens forget actually plug wall isnt shit bluetooth yet cmon man
spent like 2 hour super late night trying figure pc wasnt posting checked everything unplugged replugged cable removed replaced ram different configuration find simply never seating ram completely even though little tab lock would get pushed felt like going insane posted perfectly realized
hmmmmm two stand one way back 35 harddrives ran ide cord put cord wrong could life figure harddrive wouldnt show lol took last week went build havent opened since 2021 cleaning thermal pastei never heard backplate come cpu cooler got put back wouldnt screw sat hour realized backplate must dropped
1 forgot io shield 2 getting 8gb ram week later ordered extra stick 16gb total 3 aware existence splitter cable mobo two fan connector 3fan case one fan work 4 stock wraith spire cooler came r5 1600 could get 3 4 screw left way 5 didnt push ram way wouldnt boot correctly 6 even remotely consider cable management case time corsair carbide great value heavy however cable management option abysmal finagle lot wouldnt touching part today case great cable management wild think
one gpu cable wasnt plugged psu completely kept crashing thought driver issue
didnt properly install ram took rebuilding whole thing figure
recently bent cpu pin ram wasnt working
removed jumper thinking packing protection 12
installed window legacy instead uefi never bothered change still running install 7 year later lol
building computer decade thing psu switch every time lol
well bent pin power 6 pin gpu ignored also really bad cheap psu never gon na
removed thermal paste heat sink toasted setup rather quickly
simply reading instruction little wire power reset switch go putting random spot wondering wouldnt power
forgot take plastic sticker cooler copper plate
soldered diode wrong way round building zx81 realised cut leg
first experience literally 1 month ago honestly pretty good ran couple problem 1 accessory screw dont come accessory box side come separate accessory box hidden fucking hard drive cage psu area took 1 hour find another 15 hour get fucking box could start 2 bought radiator aio tall top case managed squeeze anyway im happy idea wire squeezing murdered hand though def isnt prettiest run
first time modifying prebuilt new gpu new ram new psu first forgot plug cpu power cable psu forgot install ram take heat sink repaste second time vc friend conversation went something like maybe ram issue dunno lem lookoh ram issue issue ram isnt ah thatll
first time forgot stand offs lmao
happened second pc build freaking system wouldnt post finished recently remounted aio twice led error code light pointed cpu ram issue already tried reseating ram time started panicking thinking new mobo messed cpu appeared perfectly fine inspected also wondered weird issue m2 drive checked fine eventually say maybe ram even though stick lighting originally inserted reseated ram stick night lighting wasnt great tried looking thing daytime could see inside better thats could finally see wasnt getting bottom end ram stick fully seated socket reseated pushed harder made sure heard click bottom timeand worked suffice say felt like idiot lol
dropping tiny screw inside case disappearedafter total dismantle entire pc realised landed almost impossibly inside psuit got stuck thereyikes take apart remove good thankfullytook day tho dropping tiny screw note taking apart psu isnt recommended everyone due risk shock note2 dont drop tiny screw near open case
rig would show image monitor would turn would turn failed notice tiny switch motherboard next ram flipped didnt remember reading switch manual flipped thinking ive tried everything else pc worked great
letting mate said know he help
shoved ram stick wrong way damaged connector instantly damaged thrown directly trash luckily mobo fine
built first pc corsair 7000d didnt take glass door working open adhesive keep attached hinge weakened enough glass panel came
day ago accidentally used cpu cable old psu frying mobo couldnt figure would boot one cpu power rail
couldnt figure damn hard screw m2 ssd screw kept popping ssd wasnt way
oh mine assembled nice machine time ryzen 3600 radeon 5700xt refused boot drove nut figured id blown cpu bought another good motherboard worked fine cheap low end amd cpu built graphic middle covid getting stuff slow month radeon 5700xt need 700 watt power supply obviously read supplied manual
funny enough zero trouble pc past thanks dad knowledge building computer recently bought part new pc asked father help nostalgia since know worked 20 year ago im kinda ignorant point put cpu strong uncaring manner think wasnt really enjoying thing tried get soon possible noticed sooner would told ill thought ok still bit surprised turned pc ok time became worried cpu heating 100c game idle ended time many attempt resolve go see specialist shop cpu bent pin like 45 buy new cpu one doomed never told dad fault though think done alone bother want buy new pc want go without building part think best
everything said also ram passive aggressive pop every damn time
built pc back 2003 didnt install motherboard standoff huge oof
didnt plug cpu power first time tried turn pc everything else went smoothly
back og titan came 2 sli decided ultrachad watercool top line x79 rig everything went well running great stupid as decided try turn one fitting get bitspower logo right side running 3000 drain huge mess clean
got ta tie first second build first build boot drive small didnt update driver anything using 4 year second build spent 2 hour turning computer last night get thru window install prompt every time turned red mobo light im 99 certain need flash updated bios itll smooth egg
return motherboard put protective plastic cover protects cpu pin am5 mobo inside retention bracket proceeded latch took bit force totally smooshed pin socket put back box returned best buy full refund shameless

installed window wrong drive got wrong psu
upgraded intel cpu replaced gputhen switch pc bootsbut image screeni forgotten connect power cable gpuno integrated graphic intel xeon processor
first build 2nd build week built installed window driver download updated bios etc kept crashing crashing crashing random restarts gpu related error spent day troubleshooting clean installs driver swapped gpu swapped power supply turn bios updated beta bios flashed non beta bios working fine feel stupid mad
forgot plug usb power cable aio spent two hour trying work wasnt working
connected case rgb connector way around burnt rgb never got see nice colour colour degraded horrible spectrum case aerocool p7 c1 something supposed diamond shape cool minimal led strip front turned shit never could enjoy light haunt day idk keep next build give away
built carpet dont worry 2nd better bed
ive actually made lot pc building mistake building first pc even year since already experience taking pc especially laptop apart reassembling stage watch lot tech youtubers building first pc well prepared however understand install io shield correctly leading shoving somehow port inaccessible take pc apart month later fix mistake though
back day integrated io absolutely completed couple build forgetting install io shield
cheaped power supply ended upgrading graphic card couldnt run anything bc psu weak learned lesson hard way thankfully long pc safety feature would shut instead dangerous problem
buying amd gpu
hard say count first pc first one built scratch wasnt forgot standoff thankfully plugged felt something finally realized motherboard definitely supposed fitting like thats realized standoff mind many year ago pentium 4 system top line time
second pc owned first built screwed striker 2 mobo directly case stand screw switched fizzed like fly zapper weird thing worked fine q6600 chip loved decent overclock friend still look back pc unintentional mutation pc 25 year ago shit
first time guy stopped
still havent installed io shield current build ive two year ive building 20 year
yep first machine ever built scratch 14 really proud day later wouldnt power took local computer supply shop guy flipped psu power switch pushed machine back idea switch even
already mb screwed heatsink thermal pasted power connection realizedshit forgot stupid plate
ive built dozen computer laptop repair smd replacement etc last month upgrading home server done move closer tv setupuse movie spent 15 minute trying figure keyboard worked mouse didnt never plugged mouse back moving
good thing motherboard come io installed nowadays
still get flashback back parent coming home playing pc allowed used pull plug turn quickly
forgot io plate still without lmao
yupp luckily installed gpu cooler yet noticed large shiny part box hole yupp freaked wouldnt boot doubble checked everything triple check psu
used one many switch psui switched 220 110 volt bang
never forgot psu switch never remembered io shield
lian li case got case connector one cable
forgot cpu power second build friend house cpu light thought sol good 30 minute didnt make mistake past 8 year lol
forgetting plug cpu taking like 3 hour step step watching tutorial apparently still missed step sub take long solve haha
hyte case
year ago psu came 4pin cpu power connector motherboard 8pin cpu power slot since didnt match didnt connect system didnt boot panicked half hour trying different thing decided actually rtfm saw mention 4pin connector put onto 8pin specific spot worked instantly
new antec case amazing
ive giving 45 month since june 2022 3080 ending coming june always paid time fortunately
got lucky 0 interest payment amazon 18k 3090ti
apr
could worse could payment plan something like pizza
nothing comment combination 1995 texas bold fucking standoff conjured waco raid yes know actually 93 strongly mind confused comment wasnt anything
around time 20 year ago thing idea wrong back thing lot random eventually work pc building still isnt easy day nightmare people got boot first attempt
ha first build 14 year old dx4x100 exact problem thing beast compared 386x25 time
look mr fancy pant dip switch
building since 90 case sharp easy short board put little washer standoff case mine dual voodoo card forgot put cable
486 1995 thats prime penrtium era
struggle real still fingertip andor fingerprint still lol
radiator fan blowing toward fin one day troubleshooting high temp found reason gigantic dust cake caused p
eh guess people know whats meant stock cooler cpu came without cooler thing stock cooler cpu know semantics there people read thing assume stock cooler stock cooler stock cooler get trouble sometimes read thing like stock cooler intel cpu adequate
miss day going bios disabling com parallel port used order cut irq conflict still occasionally assign irqs manually
couldnt figure 5600x hit 95 arctic freezer 360 idle
luckily remembered fully clipped tower fan though
30 year ago harddisk sticker spindle head motor lock colleage forgot remove killed disk
theyre little mentioned thing mess build
luckily realized missed something mb wasnt quite fitting dont get almost nobody mention standoff watched building tutorial week even buying part one ever mentioned anything standoff
right 14 saved buy everything got home instantly got work seemed feel like eternity went power flashed shut killed whole vibe took week figure died little week finally found bag extra screw week later asked friend beside never spoke took like hr remove mobo installed standoff put everything back together heart racing hit power button seemed like age saw first post amount joy excitement unreal
similar didnt realize tomahawk rgb switch spent money get corsair icue hub conversion cable saw switch mobo went unplug pin
save money another 10 month buy new stuff oof sorry dude long time wait replace model give little upgrade
air always blow towards side extra plastic completely open side suck
fan embossed spin direction air direction rather hard find doubt connect 12v ground see air go youre checking high powered delta fan keep finger away 200 cfm beast double carrot slicer
mistake making colour coded orange black limited choice part increased budget 400
yeah ive built 2 pc 8 year honestly havent problem reuse gpu upgraded previously pulled put new pc realised plastic film
ill never forget zap memory feel like happened super slow motion dont know actually happened exactly like exaggeration retrieving data old build kind molex ide hdd paired idecompatible motherboard trying get file sata hdd paired sata motherboard may ide cddvd drive third involved time process flash drive werent quite large yet 100gb external usb backup ran like 130 basically two tower three cord running back forth trying get old machine running ide cddvd drive sata hdd ide hdd etc thought power enough plug molex ide hdd second molex touched hdd molex pin saw giant bright white orb memory size quarter vividly remember orb falling seemed like lowgravity mode disappearing point motherboard speaker started blaring alarmsiren tiniest whisp smoke vapor dissipated eye nothing melted somehow hdd file fine wasnt start idiocy recovery cant remember quite exactly clearly hadnt learned software side thing cutting corner also somehow messed boot sector think formatted one hdds window hdds separate window installs learned restore mbr
always got rid worse bottom barrel tier e psu got jpac 500w psu nice looking case psu felt light empty opened looked like 10 worth radio shack part used make people complained psu often failed even exploded dont think around anymore
700 mhz
similar issue last build using evga clc aio cooler didnt know 12 pin connector getting power whole unit thing instant temp spike cpu also checked make sure wasnt sticker cooler plate looked instruction didnt delve deep enough apparently saw cable didnt think needed thought mobo didnt right connector aio got power everything gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
instruction manual though guilty lazy read friend computer ran 4 year think ram wrong slot
speccy friend forget spec time
every time finish building press front panel power nothing happens gasp oh
ive reached day age io plate attached mobo
last two build havent io shield installed
3 5 time open computer forget flip back
every time lol
think reason didnt forget last time built mobo cause yeah
im pretty sure never installed mine since idea one inluded lmao
motherboard company make first item box plate big piece paper say hey dumbass install first
everything screwed plugged motherboard etc tried put plate realized needed go first remembered ten year ago buddy built first pc got end picked io plate asked thing strange look quickly answered oh dont need understand lmao
dont know people act like forgetting io shield kind irreversible mistake remove expansion card unscrew mobo lift slightly place shield take 5 minute dont need worry redoing heatsink fact make convenient handle lifting board
built new pc ten year game shocked find case thermaltake tower 300 way one cable really live future
lian li wonderful case feature like theyre great couple stinker year overall great
newer corsair one 2500x singular cable io
yeah payment plan really big deal long dont pay penny interest
ah nothing like 299 curry pc world im pretty irresponsible money changing job paid didnt help best part card 3080 ti end 2022
klarna allowed deliveroo worst decision anyone could made
damn remember watching raid unfold tv thinking damn really happening
hate break 20 year ago 2005
one thing tell thoughthose part durable af short problem delicate shit deal today
5600 usually ran 5060c idle would ramp high 70 80 basically anything year later decided reseat tower saw sticker
100 go watch building video none even mentioned vital part process
standoff everyone else
happy hear work end 13 year old self wasnt lucky took apart reread manual found fault asked friend try swap hardware determine could salvaged mobo wouldnt anything cpu cpu wouldnt work mobo despite socketchipset year saving every penny burned instant crushing intro building
tell coworkers need test device psu first make sure doesnt turn
awaiting selfflippable psu switch save u moron petrifying second
searching box released pre installed mb lol
might new mb design build 2 pc year dont io shield 1 asus 1 msi
reason io shield attached mobo
except 45 month 36 month 1620 thats quite bit interest
299 fuck finish military basic training finance dodge charger well
dude 299 interest gpu pretty irresponsible
1995 eternity ago 2005 like couple year back 2063 wake tomorrow wont surprised
ugh eldest car day pointed car liked e90 bmw talked realized e90 20 year old told much said wan na see 20 year old bmw looked like age showed pic e30 think died little day
thing sit motherboard screwing case theyre insulated actual metal standoff surrounding area insulated mobo must screwed standoff case
backfire psu selfturns youre installing 2000 nvidia gpu poof got 2000 paper weight prefer unplug anyway leave power cord across front case remember plug
ha didnt bother math since claimed pay time guess minimum payment whole way thru
sound like prevent electrical short circuit bonus give motherboard little room breath circulate air standoff screw provided case manufacturer
yeah able math save money thats rich education
yes day come pre installed make sure standoff touch motherboard location except one screw mount mobo case
true jfc tho 1600 something isnt even 4080 super higher gpu maker best fucking customer
actively try dismantle public education love poorly educated
price difference isnt much yet 6950xt much faster enough power connector decent psu go 6950xt hand
psu make model cpu
6950xt great card got mine new 479 october last year sale disappointed there huge difference two id go 6950xt
quiet pure 850w gold ryzen 5 7600x3d
6950xt way
want validation buy 7800xt ask straight people love card lol
mean intels battlemage account excellent lowmid range set card ive seen expecting
7800xt must 500 euro 500 good price say bought one sapphire 470
impossible know pricing 9070 xt ready likely faster 7800xt access fsr4 big deal
probably 9070 look sweet pretty close release said im happy 7800xt itll last year
wait apu die
wanted wait pulled trigger 7800 xt couldnt wait anymore god know price amd gon na put 7800 xt best value gpu cant go wrong
working computer would buy cpu use
7800xt good deal point view 500eur example im playing i7 9700k16gb ddr4radeon 6900xt im able play hogwarts legacy everything high without rt 4k60fps fsr quality running like charm visible framedrops hogsmeade like everyone im also playing last u everything high without rt without fsr 4k60fps frame gen rock solid 60fps smooth considering 7800xt giving performance 6900xt youll good year issue play high ultra tweak little bit fsr fg
bought 7800xt nitro 5 day ago im happy decision getting new gen msrp hard youll probably neeed wait month like im hyped 7800xt amazing card 1440p say go
buy used 3060 12gbs 150200 2070s
go upgraded 7800xt sapphire pulse 1660s recently happy performance 1440p 9000 card release march run issue supply scaplers another half year becomes purchasable reasonable price
paid 500 7800 xt dont want risk losing scalper paying extra tariff im thrilled great card mean nice upgrade wife
old gone lot generation launch observation always dumbass leading launch explaining much gusto heshe waiting launch new generation buy old generation pricebreak logic look sound always look sound mean ebay right need understand really going card manufacturer making old gen last minute stopped making old gen higher edition card ago swapped new stuff playing game stock want stock depleted right launch idea walk bestbuy get discounted 4070 cause want deplete stock something nvidia amd actively trying avoid meanwhile trick think happening people replacing last year card year card selling discount never go way go ebay look price bit never completly understood truth undeniable discount want isnt really meanwhile store shelf scalper grabbing inventory quickly find advice gpu buying isnt really hard figure want look mfsrp use budget put money away dont touch ready pounce see patient might wait
7800xt amazing card
7800xt im happy get perfect 1440p amd zero driver issue unlike nvidia insert video linus giving middle finger however wait think next gen radeons seem like considerable enough jump
love 7800xt obviously meant high end ray tracing dont even turn rt time 1440p 120fps vast majority game doesnt even flinch price cant go wrong ever
wouldnt get 7800xt one great card new gen amd significantly better worth waiting nvidia 5070ti also intriguing move towards ai could pay big time lame duck cant wait try nvidia geforce 2 month cost barely anything fun try choose new gen leisure comparison review without feeling pressure
used 6900xt less
got mine yesterday im sk happy think use case im gon na notice difference new 9070 series
still hope 9070xt good card bring balance graphic card market dont want wait case flop go 7800xt still great card
bad idea new gen amd gpus almost literally already term store stockpiled arent allowed buy yet release 5 week away every indication theyll lot performant current gen plus youll access fsr4 youve waited long whats another month bit wait
spending 500 card doesnt support ml based super resolution 2025 age well really wait 9070 cant afford upcoming 5070 ti
wait month bit
id get used 4070ti super new 5070 budget dlss4 way good amd struggling compete dlss 2
b580 one downside far know thats scalped hell find one 300 buck get enjoy
get amazon get 30 day return like amd announces
thats good part whole thing good know beloved card thanks
im pretty happy somehow entire year since got could sworn 4 month price least waiting wouldnt helped
7900xtx
dont play well lowmid range cpu
thing may changed last heard significant overhead problem older low end cpu httpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7ghttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv3dfxjyte7g
need newgood cpu
least shipping portugal 500 best find saphire one find 600 actually place
565 amazon
holding since november however bought brother 6750xt almost 2 year ago price never gone go bit remains stable starting feel going 6 month without main pc end buying card could bought november exactly price
risky wait imo trump tariff pricing 9070 gon na inflated
problem saw thread everyone say coincidence booted ubuntu system get specific work done decided dist upgrade upgraded rebooted never came back life pc turn second show red light cpu turn try different apu bought 3200g second hand 30 euro testing boot ok
considering 5700x3d although already bit expensive first considered pulling trigger
portugal terrible second hand stuff everyone think something precious worth around 56 buying new even looking european ebay rarely see something 10 new worth hassle tbh
thank much observation greatly appreciated
im primarily seeing lot 3xxx card sale seems like lot people replacing 5xxx card anticipating good deal ive seen couple 3070tis 325
new gen amd significantly better worth waiting know without real benchmark price point
current price leak pretty bleak though there scalping dont think get hand 9070 5 week even willing throw 900 wanted
9070 supposed come 900 sure cut bit price doubt talking similar price range
sure theory even wait 3 year get whatever would get next month cheaper sarcastic exactly struggle constantly b een delaying decision cause always next gen next intel driver fix black friday wait gen
5070 650 euro saw second hand market pretty bad appreciate feedback though big wave pro7800xt first hour big wave people nice perspective
plus low performance lower end cpu
amd killed 6000 7000 series go
spend 500 friend recently got one 370
id say anything absolute best suffer somewhat
pretty sure gn dispelled myth
cpu
500 fine price paid 560 mine back jan last year regret love little beast gpu run everything throw 1440p easily paired ryzen 7600 popular combination two pair perfectly
motherboard
sound like life portugal doesnt matter
presume reset bios know pain retest unlikely cpu would fry software
upgraded exact combo couple month back work amazing 1440p go worry upgrading couple year
would good combo gaming 5600x would okay thats afford assume am4 motherboard already
really unfortunate honestly sorry hear eastern europe people selling 900 series gtx card 250 u equivalent possible card shipped purchased u seller break importation law
pricing leak leak especially ignored theyre likely wrong often part bc changed last minute official release past say 900 maybe itll likely itll way cheaper well wait week see scalping open q much seems like scalper focus limited supply nvidia card well see
doesnt really matter anymore nvidia priced 5070 ti 750 amd price 9070 xt 700 mean 9070 would 600
difference 6 week 6 month though
come fps visual quality dlss4 give 2540 higher fps visual quality equivalent native even better sometimes amd cant compete theyre far behind 910 gamers choose nvidia
httpswwwmindfactorydeproductinfophp12gbgigabytegeforcertx4070windforceocaktivpcie40x16retail1489368html 550 4070 5070 similarly priced
know cheapest seen 489 past month looking
yeah insane seeing b580 lose performance 5700x3d despite cpu holding back much powerful 4080 super
gn admission tested fairly limited suite compared hardware unboxed
steve clear result invalidate people conclusion showed effect disappears high resolution crank every setting max hardware unboxed ran test configuration much closer someone tight budget would actually play game
yap puzzled review seeing driver overhead post expected worst normal seems like damage battlemages reputation done matter misguided reviewer intentional foul play
b580 b570 lose performance paired low endmid cpu defeat whole point entry level gpu httpsyoutubebujsnbvyxvasic9qioxn4ef4hcq3 httpsyoutubecyojr3masi0ylke7xcatndmonh
apu died buying new cpu
b450 tomhawk max
would prevent boot regardless cpu cause boot 3200g 5700g checked firmware version case ubuntu done something crazy version greatly appreciate feedback btw thanks lot
yeah trying maximize am4 board 32gb ram already decent ssd plus since 3200g side testing problem like future could always move gpu new build newer chipset leave current build 3200g kid utility build kind thing
youd usually pay tax top 23 total cost including shipping 225 thats 63 extra top
facebook marketplace edit people downvoting think used gpus bad lmao
also interesting 5700x3d faster 7600x gaming overall 7600x experienced significantly less intel driver overhead necessarily surprising still noteworthy
pure cope vendetta hardware unboxed loved card initially vram price performance came gn also said result got dont invalidate reviewer point issue bad higher resolution setting youre realistically gon na entry level graphic card
youre spending 500 gpu ill guess youll get decent cpu wouldnt worry cpu issue still exist
hard say thing bit mysterious without knowing exactly go people possible know there new cpu reset parameter mystery really cpu shouldnt usually able fry like software o shouldnt changing anything bios usually
yeah make sense
could find 2070s better around price point someone u able willing ship could good deal youve got money buy new imo id get 7800xt wait another couple month amd drop 9000 series along hopefully new cuda frame work best luck man
guess youre getting downvoted fb marketplace reliable source everyone cant guarantee want especially youre major metropolitan area possible scammer deal unsure condition card probably warranty also stating friend got one 370 without also stating got used bit apple orange
probably extra memory bandwith ddr5
isnt basically everything am4 affected though op would buy motherboard ram
definitely give shot report back work find way remotely buy beer everyone saying coincidence maybe dist upgrade pushed dying cpu edge 3yo 1 week cpu never pushed hard though find odd yes thats 1 week warranty expired talk coincidence thank
op replied info
dont think apple orange comparison used pc part absolutely fine one thread said wanted new one youre budget id always try get hand used part except psu storage even big box store like best buy microcenter recommended lot available everywhere
try open third slot case first hole smal pcie slot
get 5080 line upgrade cpu yes overkill time upgrade whole system catch
course applies last genrtx 4000 would think decade old hardware would new one
u go 40 50 u upgrade part compulsorily need upgrade ur cpu ur mobo u go 40 series u make 850w psu even tho thats enough 50 series well would recommend getting 1000 w atleast coming gpu 50804080 70 40 series job almost always depends u looking wouldnt recommend spending much 5090 unless u really actual use case u go 4090 instead personal recommendation pricebest performance 4070ti
buy unknown gpu older model tested speak wait 50 series approved still would go older gpu better value money
5080 fine 1440p max setting 4k reduced setting
4070 5070 unless youre trying get 4k id say 5080 overkill
5070 ti might something look vram 4080 5080 performance cost less look like good card
depends game want play want play game bit older 7900xtx want play game releasing future would get 4080 super 5080
people disappointed 50 series expected kind miraculous new performance benchmark instead performance 40 series equal price core count want powerful stuff thats 50 series youre upgrading 10 series pretty much anything huge upgrade nevermind raytracing thats becoming requirement
considering fact youre still old hardware mean upgrade per decade said go highest end stuff afford
nvidia geforce rtx 5080 best gpu get unless go crazy rtx 5090 earth hear rtx 5080 would substantial upgrade thats crazy going 1070 5080 probably 4x5x multiplier maybe even rtx 5080 definitely recommended route go im running rtx 4070 ti super dont much reason upgrade money issue absolutely would go 5080 5090 latest generation nvidia tensor core 5000 series massive improvement 4000 series lot people dont take account evaluating performance difference one important factor
get best gpu fit budget need
amd rx 6800 average 350400 dont say budget pair nicely cpu got
kind gpu pretty severely limited old cpu likely wont get high fps remotely modern game id consider cpu upgrade along gpu likely gon na skyrocket upgrade cost new cpu mean new motherboard new ram least 5080 pretty high end card going 1070 even 40704070ti super better would significant upgrade
4090 ti budget isnt problem option go team red keep getting competitive price
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build im
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
1440p max setting overkill 2080 run game 1440p high setting 40705070 would better option
ive already got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d 5090 abit budget
6800 xt good card dont know ops budget feel bit silly pair best gaming cpu market 2 generation old midhigh end card
100 get 7800xt wouldnt spend 350 500 6800
ive got hand ryzen 7 9800x3d new build
set congratulation mate wish enough money upgrade like
yea thats good pairing pair am5 mobo amd expo ram u good u waiting 50 series stock might well wait ryzens new line processor eye 9950x3d
depends high many fps want
whatever best thats next 5080 amd want wait whatever else
perform worse actually
well youre pretty much set monster lol
thanks year making fair
nothttpscdnmoscmsfuturecdnnet3buqtn5dzgqi7zl8xs4wulpng also better upscaling framegen capability ai accelerator 6800 xt
think im worried future proof card 16gb vram cant afford 5090
5080 thinking 4080 super 1015 according leak last long long time mate 16gb vram sure couldve 20 24 peace mind thats nvidias segmentation 16gb still gon na fine 1440p even 4k least year vram capacity becoming important nowadays bad people make yet
okay ryzen 7 9800x3d 5080 future proof good
4090 5090 powerful setup could currently build yeah pretty much
okay thanks think wanted clarification
assuming youre playing least 1440p gpu bottleneck large majority time 12900k 9900x would perform similarly reason 12900k doesnt double amount thread core core pcores performance core two thread per core ecores efficiency core one thread per core would still go 9900x though since consumes less power platform receive least one generation cpu future
using pc anything gaming
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewamdryzen99900x19html efficiency core 12900k dont anything gaming plus beyond 8 performance core there littleno benefit sometimes even detrimental due ccdchiplet design am5 cpu
gaming would still recommend going am5 7700x 9700x plenty 7600x3d would also good alternative arent thread always 2x multiple core 12900x 16 24 normally yes intel changed architecture performance efficiency core efficiency core dont multithreading 8 p core 2 8 e core 24 latest generation core ultra doesnt multithreading
yeah 1440p im gaming say platform supported one gen youre talking am5 supported one round cpu correct benefit would able upgrade cpu one gen requiring new motherboard somewhat subscribe upgrade philosophy build new system entirely 56 year future proofing isnt huge concern mine thanks bunch detailed response
yeah also workstation pc also play cpu intensive game like city skyline football manager cs2 intensive still cpu bound game thats im leaning towards i9ryzen 9 7
interesting gamingwise basically 8 core 16 thread
thanks reply breakdown p core e core included original post itll also workstation pc game play cpu intensive like city skyline football manager etc im leaning towards 9 7
lot game dont 8 core
pretty much unless lot multitasking video editingrendering
yup least foreseeable future perhaps 35 year game better optimized use core unlikely well see major way year next gen console release
used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly
aib model 5090s avoid whatever reason pay asus tax
got sparkle intel arc a310 eco tforce vulcan 25 inch ssd know powerful stuff play league legend pc want 144fps stuff get know pci 4 slot card resizable bar needed
gigabyte b650 aorus elite ax v2 decent enough motherboard ryzen 5 7600x 64gb ram
im thinking getting new pc upgrading current one something ive never done spec need find current pc share see would better video card one know sure need radeon rx 580
want bench test cpu motherboard ram make sure component work wait gpu without installing cpu cooler im going sff cooler block ram would repaste cpu replace ram end issue ram
hey live israel gpu market kinda expensive rtx 4070 ti super go like 1165 store sapphire rx 7600 xt 16gb go 455 asrock amd radeon rx 6700 xt challenger pro 12gb oc much would guy pay gpu second hand get around 200250 good deal considering price listed
5080 review start coming
thing dustproof build build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible
game dev would recommend going amd card higher vram nvidia card lower vram nvidia card really expensive tough choice
hi everyone motherboard current miniitx build giving endless usb current error hardly get past bios im taking time couple upgrade system im going larger midtower case many fan aio new atx mobo never built pc older part usually start fresh sorry dumb question able assemble new pc existing psu gpu cpu m2 plug everything work
got 9700x rest build cant find video card save life right looking 4070 super something close around 600 good holdover card play something like fortnite 1440p reasonable framerate wait something become available
im currently running 5600 rx6600 650w psu full tower case going lan party pain im thinking swapping itx case thats backpack size concern psu according pcpartpicker rig consume around 260w go 300w 400w flex psu
would better get 750w psu 12vhpwr connector 1000w psu without one im probably going get 4070 super 5070
im new pc building build found sub im interested 7600 rx7800xt cost 1000 question much downgrade bit choose like cheaper gpu still able easily play modern game smoothly keep saving make build build httpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42klhttpscapcpartpickercomuserphotonman1savedpy42kl sorry dumb question
likely 5070 ti end performing similarly 4080 super card due launch 750800 wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty furmark pretty reliable way test gpu run card near max power anything unstable overheating likely show
youre going digging getting new review aibs every day nothing stick like sore thumb yet also youre planning grabbing card release best picky get stock going extremely limited launch day
hardware gen ago still trick consider something like r5 5600 b550 board 12100f12400f b660 board
yup
rebuilt system couple week ago ice version board 9700x couldnt gone smoother easy expo ram timing getting pbo setup 20 curve optimizer worked great quick booting assuming modular power supply id suggest plugging cpu 84 pin power mount board case bit hard get installed
list component
youre sure system summary view hwinfo64 tool download give need wont tell cooler case power supply though know thing plug pcpartpicker list paste
getting bios sure long sort heatsink put cpu whenever need quick test ill literally take spare stock cooler place metal ihs without putting paste plugging fan
disclaimer powering system without properly installed cooler potential damage cpu least leave angry message boot youre overheating missing cpu fan said bench boot system get bios ensure cpu motherboard ram function prior full assembly case gpu need form video wont post however whether thats igpu old graphic card cpu doesnt igpu dont spare card floating around wont able test strongly recommend finding something keep top cpu bench posting even cooler sitting top cpu paste anchored minimize risk plan anything thats simple post test please properly secure cooler
4070ti double performance 6700xt 14 price seems like solid pickup
embargo lifted launch day thursday
thing dustproof build make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap build easy maintenance easily accessible filter frequent dusting easy possible yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect
thing dustproof build best get case easy remove toolless panel tray filter pop run fawcet leave dry pop right back often couple week youll avoid worst still get layer dust inside eventually component fan blade frame youll clean recommend looking fractal design case since usually nice filter decent brand nowadays offer
amd gpu decent game development rgamedevhttpswwwredditcomrgamedevcomments15auicgisanamdgpudecentforgamedevelopment here helpful thread provide good insight
part yeah part distinct piece puzzle fit work take old part motherboard put new motherboard profit real concern storage window install window gotten pretty good detecting new hardware like new motherboard configuring existing install perfect back data continuing case process go bad reformat reinstall o may also run window activation issue youre oem license since thats tied old motherboard ive luck calling microsoft telling youve swapped motherboards due old one dying theyll hook code fix install activated microsoft accountlinked key fix sign back
used 3070
anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough
400w sure 300 way close computer power usage
id argue would want wiggle room future expandability id also argue going small enough mandate flexatx unit difficult build occasional lan party might need go small look option like coolermaster nr200p deepcool ch160 fractal design terra take cheaper flexible sfx psus case might backpackable definitely fit duffel bag alongside peripheral ask know
gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less
thanks
thats nice hear
okay ill try figure find dont original order form
thank ill use one know sure video card
make completely enclosed mean airflow mean terrible thermal performance also custom solution think none cheap thanks name know expensive yes need pick case toolless removal many modern case hopping trend pick case think look cool look review make sure ergonomics expect thanks mean dust would get stuck outside filter wouldnt cake fan
thanks friendo hoping hear assumed would work puzzle wanted make sure wouldnt shenanigan m2 popped new mobo mainly keep concern mind booting hope dont reformat reinstall end day really steam game biggie
4060 290 perhaps
window right click task bar open task manager click detail button open info go performance tab able get info
dust filter going completely prevent dust getting caking fan airflow would terrible

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna

lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user

anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality

5080 benchmark yet
im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause

dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying

thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

alright getting hard number today

think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade

thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come

yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series

got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus
deleted
well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch
""
scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote
part work 3d animation render gpus hence relevant u none term used particularly obscure happy help something isnt clear
mean knew going yikes saw 575w tdp didnt think itd actually hit 500w consistently though im surprised people dont take issue
yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

cope supposed new gen price jump gon na massive aibs looking 2300
one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

got tip best ive always bought second hand
month sound like lot difficulty
remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid
even 580s sli era 500 2 2010 voodoo tnt pre 2000 iirc sub 300 card dropped lower tier card much cheaper tv tuner version expensive always wanted one lol

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month
midlate ampere thing lovelace went right back early ampere add cartout stock
bestbuy doesnt offer waitlist notify come stock nothing pleasant email come already botted
great give time save money evga wait list 3090 worked well enough
discord channel good
feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

cant speak bb actually going use 40 series bh literally send confirmation email option get signed biweekly update say still list whatevs eventually get email saying restocked like 24 hour something actually buy card lose spot oem manufacturer well dont post notify link actual launch got 2040 series card evga asus bh still dont believe dont know tell
wow didnt realize 3080 ti could actually bogged mean 3060 ti struggle minecraft 4k shaders without shaders could run 8k still nail 60 fps probably already impressed xd might build machine 3080 ti point cuz like 30 series overall except 3050 nobody like 3050 good doesnt deserve anything hate get 4080 super good alternative youre looking upgrade one gen go 50 series
got got alienware 3225qf ive got 4k 240hz looking build new system 5090 might alley currently 5 year old rig 2080 super
wasnt talking pushpull setup rather fan blow air across card lengthwise rather card youd need fairly thick card make work 2slot card would limit tiny 40mm fan 3 4 slot many card already could use 6080mm fan move lot air much lower speed would aided natural fronttoback airflow many tower case already
true 2000 financed inflation negligible 5 inflation 24 month thats 200 buying 2k gpu 200 doesnt mean much
ahh thats pity scalper win
bh got hope nothing dont retailer actual waitlist id verification something way people could actually get fair timeframe

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement
never said observation needed pump core count power limit get kind increase previously one neither node shrink clear dealing significantly improved raster rt core last gen put card closely aligned spec weird spot
miss evga best havent personally heard direct sale notification queue im sure anyone intel wed like know im signed whatever get feel like im mostly going bet farm snagging launch minute pick notification never helped back 30 series fiasco
commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin
im restrospect shouldve shelled little bit 4090 cest la vie got enjoy powerful card rarely found wanting almost 3 year
genuinely relevant career youre making enough get ai workstation better yet private rack somewhere way prolevel card two thats stretch dont really need learn ai career there really lot edge case dont fall one two group
im nerd want im sure much use something like 5090 diy ai vast majority model likely going train run fine whatever right truly big boy stuff wont anything less data center small window want run train something big easier rent resource plus youd unable use machine anything else daysweeks
look like 3090 founder going 750900ish kinda range ebay moment id probably look local buyer kinda range though friend who 2070 super melted recently he making due brother old 1080 ti favor like watch dog free sometimes ill probably offer friend discount first especially since paid 500

honestly unless near microcenter timeability potentially camp launch wouldnt bother would set many waitlistnotifications possible wait patiently first card thats available rip evga best
understand sound like correctly however take active second step original comment stand make sense productive cash repayment
well dont laptop skus show kind scaling time could keep power limit core theyd clock lower
honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
use 28 4k work great
27 1440p sweet spot reason
went 32 va 1440p 28 ip 4k didnt like ended selling 32 returning 28 buying 3x 1440p 27 ip work gaming 4070s 5080 id go 32 4k 500
1440p 140hz 27 way already 32

4k 32inch way
pg27ucdm 27 4k oled expansive monitor would like
4k 240hz monitor exist use two awesome experience
recently went gtx1060 1080p 27 4080s 1440p aw3423dwf tell difference staggering figured setup provide solid frame rate aaa title easily 5 year 34 monitor really nice afraid would big think really end perfect could easily afford 40905090 4k monitor 4k oled monitor choice still bit limited size option ultimately think 34 oled monitor 1440 make better overall experience 27 even 4k plus youll get fps 1440 machine wont require upgrade soon
4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go
waste id recommend bothering 4k though 27 1440p 240hz going incredible gaming
used pixel per diagonal inch ppdi metric found 15in fhd laptop 1920x1080 152 ppdi benchmark knew needed meet exceed benchmark bigger monitor found 4k 27in monitor 166 ppdi better benchmark 32in monitor 140 ppdi benchmark running five 27in 4k monitor three identical two identical configuration look excessive ridiculous unnecessary completely glorious dont game gaming monitor whoever wondering 15in 4k top 300 ppdi hope help enjoy new setup
oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though
get money get 27in 1440p 180hz isp 150 day id much rather put extra saving better pc part game 1440p get pretty nice 4k monitor around 300 check one httpswwwamazoncomktcfreesyncdisplayportadjustableh27p22sdpb0csxxp58frefascdfb0csxxp58fmcid0fdb8a322e303afa8203adc14938d751taghyprod20linkcodedf0hvadid695121222616hvposhvnetwghvrand12163508838359051720hvponehvptwohvqmthvdevmhvdvcmdlhvlocinthvlocphy1026027hvtargidpla2295941098778psc1
someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32
look tiny scaling work fine window linux oh wow eyesite pwrfect 4k kinda fine 32 43 tv would great
dont need 4k size sure nice
depends use case really 27 1440 another 4k game 1440 work 4k mostly ill occasionally play something 4k use 1440 work second monitor web tab email like noticeable much depends im im working photoshop drag two stand lot many game play
4k 27 make clean picture easy read text
1080p 27 1440p literally night day never go back 1080p 4k way go next im dead set ill go 65 fps play old game like far cry 4 red dead redemption 2 monster hunter new game play
maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go
skip 27 go 32 inch 2x 43 inch side side really happy
1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

youre asking question youre probably better saving lunch money
dont need 4k 240hz u wont able get franes 4k play like valorant something like would u buy 4k
definitely see 2k 4k tablet laptop even phone talking visual quality one upgrade literally better anything else thats oled like even modded switch use play pc game streaming 4k60 switch 1080pdisplay actually run 2k aka 1440p like many know even 1080p screen 2k look way shaper 1080p combined high bitrate make look super freaking good tiny screen like good 48 inch oled 120 4k switch screen switch legit looked better 1440p 160hz samsung odyssey oled true black make difference eye overall color way better screen type hdr actually look amazing still thing nice vibrant sadly oled tv monitor basically price monitor way expensive meanwhile obvious way smaller wanted oled lg ultra wide 48inch pc living room watch tv maybe twice year didnt want black bar kill 2 one stone put 48 inch instead 48 ultra wide tbh im happy bigger still 500 euro cheaper sony great latency especially tv 120hz might insane 60 120 jump important 120600 like someone say theyre bad 120hz 240 theyre bad theyre bad
5080 without 4k waste money
simply understand people using 20ish inch display use 55 okish
mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot
refresh rate offer immersive experience pixel peeping even 4k montior would proably still run game 1080 1440 depends watching 4k movie though want 4k
24 1080p 27 1440p 32 2160p eye money eye money
2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful
got 27 5k imac 2019 enjoyed every moment waste
ran 4k awhile loved 4070ti handled perfectly
unsure one looking know people judge saying asus got good deal 4k 144hz ip monitor bought one 560
im 1440p 27 curved perfect 4070s
1440p 27inch upto 34inch id say best value personally wouldnt go 4k anything less 42inch even price right otherwise resolution gain 2m distance barely impossible notice right im spending money oled v 4k ive gaming video editing 1440p good balance highend gpu gaming
5k 27 waste money
27 hp omen gorgeous 1440p 200 excellent year
acer nitro xv275k p3 amazing 4k monitor 160hz refresh rate good oled honestly really good price
short yes 34 1440p likely cheaper better fpshz 4k 27
gaming waste productivity work staring text day programming clarity 4k lifesaver 1440p eye
27 1440 plenty imo 32 1440p came 27 1080p ppi close small text pixel noticeable im 32 fine would get 4k size performance hit isnt worth go look screen decide personally wouldnt recommend 4k size
id recommend 1440p 27 32 1440 isnt nice imo difference 1080 1440 massive 1440 4k isnt big difference
4k120 display regret would rather 1440p240 screen 4k look nicer think double refresh rate noticable
u wan na go 4k id recommend get least 315 monitor source ive pretty much type monitor
1080 2k 100 difference tfrom 2k 4k like 40 get cant get back bro lol least get rx6900rtx3080 4k costly beautiful
golden rule 4k minimum 32 inch
dldsr 1440p look damn near 4k high end 4k tv know could look like went route save money go ultra wide 1440p make oled think oled 1440p worth 4k oled
27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p
close sit away monitor sit farther away might even noticeable get 32 get cheap chinese brand dont there way monitor resrefresh rate upscaling tech doesnt look like complete horseshit 4k actually isnt blurry 1440p isnt bad 4k game look like look crisp really see beware tho surprised disgusting pixelated everything 1080p refresh rate trap
difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz
enjoying smooooooth mouse
think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate
would gimp experience reason nvidia blackwell gpu render everypixelanew 1440p60 render 4k240 framegen upscaling welcome 2025
240hz waste money
wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp
got 4k 48inch tv mainly watching shit game well shit nice couldnt pas black friday sale
whole sweet spot thing bang buck availability people point dont 4k 1440p monitor compribale size cant side side comparison ops budget allows get gpu push performance full send budget limited got 1440p 27 think look great however 17 4k panel editing laptop ill tell look amazing infinitly crispier desktop monitor pixel density noticeable side side
level scaling use
im waiting pg27ucdm 4k oled 27 inch monitor ive playing 24 inch 1080p screen although could desk space 32 dont think im ready jump yet
depends viewing distance 27 inch 4k complete waste sit 3 screen sit 2 foot screen going need excellent eyesight tell difference sit 12 away definitely tell
waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent
youre talking ppi pixel per inch general sweet spot 24 inch 1080p 27 inch 1440p 32 inch 2160p getting smaller display higher resolution make even better
anything past 140ppi honestly pointless 27 smallest go 4k resolution 32 perfect size
samesies
upvoted comment personally cant imagine would comfortable sit close enough monitor 4k matter 27 screen someone may fine refer chart httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance
bet response time refresh rate bigger uplift dont blame titan x came 2015 gamed 4k tv barely 2845 fps sli setup waiting 5 generation upgrade good call part
almost ppi 24 1080p considered lowend sweet spot
sweet spot budget build build 5 series
okay mr fancy pant 32 foot 1440p
must beefy benq projector prop dude lol
nope there single game play us upscaling tv broadcasting
hdr400 isnt low
reason chose dwf dw understanding dw gsync compatible would suited nvidia gpu
4k 120144hz common within reasonable price range considering buyer already buying 5080
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
interesting point regret refresh rate
went 4k felt like wasting 4070 ti super 1080 gaming wow certainly night day every screen life look like cheap toy
he getting 5080
jump pixel density often higher 1440p 4k 1080p 1440p look popular screen size respective ppi lot time see people go small 1080p screen big 1440p screen actually lose pixel density
1 1080p 2k 1440p 25k 2 25k 78 pixel 2k 100 3 4k 225 time pixel 25k roughly 4 time 2k
golden rule pixel density phone tablet much higher 27 4k youre fine actually enjoy
swear oled screen making blinder everyday
many people like work mainly play factorio demanding game play moment maybe elite icarus
4k relevant resolution game feel like game would perfectly fine 1440p240hz well
one buy 5080 play doom want play newer game
smooth cursor get enough love opening menu window glorious 240hz
old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
tv care far away sitting desk youre going sitting spot regardless monitor get going big possibly handle seems like dumb advice course reddit could never
almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah

one sir
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
yes point see pixel arm length monitor thats talking sit 2 meter monitor would probably look phone truly assumed going conversation people understand talking perceived difference image clarity
length arm
op specifically mentiones point whole upgrade gaming would recommend something general use work never asked
could definetly use send tank slovakia might look like democracy pretty much orbns hungary way become new belarus russia
foot inch
thems sniper setting
adjust mouse sensitivity window setting well also gaming ingame sensitivity one person may 400 dpi 25 sensitivity another may 2000 dpi 5 sensitivity could effectively thing personally lean toward higher dpi lower ingame sensitivity keep outofgame speed consistent
eww gross pixelated cursor

nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing

congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet
went 3600x stock wraith spire cooler 5800x3d tried using wraith 5800x3d load thermal throttled recommend
age many people refuse even admit made mistake salute honest idiot
last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked
recently dealt gpu performance issue year finally figured slightly dislodged move receiving x1 pcie lane

im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case
appreciate
ohhhh
ive definitely done
crazy often stuff work barely really shouldnt
oooof
like said surprisingly effective
missed saw accepted responsibility forgot
clearly day
op need coffee
10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor
well 8 gigabyte vram xtx

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even
10 httpsyoutubefyuz1cp4rnisihqim1rfvkezov2xzt330httpsyoutubefyuz1cp4rnisihqim1rfvkezov2xzt330
indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine
7600x3d xfx magnetic air 7900xtx hell combo im 4k

sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
used 4080 super popped fb market place negotiable 800 seems pretty good one concerning thing claim still relatively new even still plastic lol anyway question whats fastest efficient way stress test used gpu ensure functioning properly

anything 300 work fine long six year old rx 6600 rtx 3060 arc series could push fortnite 60fps low enough setting honestly could even try running integrates graphic see thats enough

gigabyte udgm series btw
wouldnt buy new psu without 12vhpwr even though probably wont use right
youre getting 7600 non x come cooler need buy another one id get psu stronger 650w intention run 7800xt everything else fine
wouldnt buy 800 used 4080 super unless transferable warranty second add even warranty id wait get new generation gpu price wait next gen available youll able buy 4080 super 2030 less

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest
remarkable thermal engineering mediocre performance uplift ludicrous tdp cant ever see buying gpu suck 500w power space heater 6800xt sits 180225w gaming already make room kinda toasty longer session 510w would sauna
review vr performance seems good bump 4090 general
lol hotspot measurement mentioned der8auer water block interesting 600w die dont even see issue heat transfer insane temp clearly spicy hidding hotspot number make look better doesnt help user
would liked seen review 5080 im sure hell paying 5090 5080 would consider
anyone else interested see nvidia hardware mfg stack lossless scaling software mfg term quality
optimistic 5070ti card going look like without 4x fake frame cheesing
5080 benchmark yet
im sticking trusty 4090
5090 fe venting hot air directly onto cpu mounted vertically hyte y70 case much negative effect could cause
theory 1 cuda core sm rt core doesnt scale linearly performance ex rtx 4090 60 core 4080 roughly 3035 faster 4080 4090 likely limited l2 cache memory bandwidth 2 certain amount memory bandwidth benefit performance game beyond limit performance doesnt seem impacted memory bandwidth sensitive game like cyberpunk 2077 see biggest uplift around 4050 gn test 50 raster uplift cp2077 4090 take advantage 18tbs memory bandwidth 5090 game see mere 2025 uplift arent taking advantage bandwidth rtx 5090 certain amount bandwidth let say 12tbs anything doesnt impact performance game maybe future title might memory bandwidth sensitive well see average 4050 uplift 5090 4090
paying 25 27 performance improvement doesnt feel like generational advancement quite disappointing
also enjoy optimumshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5yjnfreqhiw review like point typically make really good explaining thing generally make review interesting watch
3080 12gb currently vram boost 5080 impressive streamer im wondering whether mfg gon na help leaving headroom encoders thing whilst gaming big question 5080 gon na outperform 4090 spec wise dont think im gon na leaning raw performance seriously hooked marvel rival 240hz oled 4090 drop enough value make price performance appealing 5080hmmm decision
suck buy new psu 750 cant use even wanted
amd need come 9070 asap

5080 review
sticking 4090 9800x3d
id really like see 5080 review v 4080s
dont get people upset pricing card 90 series titan never value card halo product either need work want fastest thing available damn expense seeing decent uplift 2050 raster improvement even without dlss 5070 5070 ti interesting one hopefully rx 9070 xt able compete midrange market
looking moving 2080 ti would best bang buck upgrade 5000 4000 series card budget wise could stretch 5090 feel isnt good value money suggestion
much scare mongering stock nvidia 5090s launch must deliberate act nvidia cause panic buying
running 5090 pcie3x16 pcie4x16 would add video review list hardware canuck rtx 5090 cpu bottleneck pcie scaling benchmark morehttpswwwyoutubecomwatchv5tjkp2a0iw specifically test running card pcie3x16 pcie4x16 stated reason people using riser cable case installation limited speed pcie4x16 test great interest people current system gpu slot pcie4x16 wont attempt summarize tested lot different combination varying result conclusion feasible run pcie4x16 without losing much im also interested happens run pcie5x8 using pcie5 lane m2 card content creation wasnt tested im fully aware pcie5x8 overall bandwidth pcie4x16 5x8 fine bandwidth point view since pcie5 reduced latency pcie4 would think 5x8 might better certainly worse 4x16 wont know sure unanticipated effect going 5x8 someone test
im seeing lot people say youre rocking 4090 worth upgrade unless fall category need latest greatest either missed nobody talking difference 3090 ti without sli worth ditch set get 5090 id like know guy opinion ignoring cost looking performance uplift dramatic impact gain like mess around mlai
thought going buy 5090 turn im going wait 6080 come likely im thoroughly whelmed
release testing 5080
5080 embargo lift 26th
seriously fence buying 5090 upgrade 3080ti 12gb vram isnt always enough nowadays 4k game 4k 120hz oled lg tv guy think would worthwhile upgrade rest spec 12600k 64gb ddr4 1000w psu
anyone compile list 5090 card boost clock thanks
508090 thinner 4000 series would awesome
really want get amd would stop sucker give decent deal
think ill buy 5080 3060ti want experience 4k frame generation first hand without breaking bank usually 5 year refresh graphic card unfortunately due scalping era suppose get 3080 kind money put ended getting 3060ti felt underwhelmed sad time buy razor laptop died never buying anything razor
guess 5070ti best bang buck 5080 really strange place nice card 16gb vram make future proof enough appealing enough people like use cuda rendering stuff need vram upgrade every 57 year since im builiding new pc ill put 1080 wait 5080 super vram
gpu market totally shit decent value card available
paid 5 hotstock premium helped get 7900xtx immediately returned 4080 back 40 series launch definitely possible beat bot scalper know probably wont secure one day one unless physically launch retail
could suggest one thing could possibly add two column review table text video 5080 text video 5090 would clean little nicely wouldnt guess video card sinnce youre putting title
raster performance bit better pessimistic speculation subreddit coming 11 scaling core count worst barring outlier likely softwarerelated rt performance however also seems less line core count scaling bit worse subreddit seemed expect cooler seems new design less efficient much bigger 4090 fe design trading volume additional point failure hot memory module net result higherpower card slightly hotterlouder gpu still manageable one dont know would want tradeoff personally card intend use extended period lot new way design age poorly lose efficiency margin error much smaller ada generation

input lag dlss4 compared dlss3 found input lag 4080 dlss3 kinda lame laggy cyberpunk also noticeable mouse lag aiming stalker 2 latest patch s2 pretty low latency mouse look maybe game specific dependent driver
alright getting hard number today
currently 2060 bought 4070 couple week ago returned immediately due 50 series announcement
think win pairing new amd cpu currently 5900x 3080 nice upgrade
wan na know worth upgrading 3080 5090
want put 2070 pasture badly 5080 5090 look like nvidia funneling 5080 supertibothwhatever

extra 100w power draw time performance giving intel vibe pump wattage chip point theyll step back focus efficiency unless also want u market install 240v line pc
good cooling system probably need wit scaling watt usage match
noiiice
nvidia successfully got consumer stating 2k founder edition flagship card rip
cooling might impressive context insane amount heat able deal end day solve problem card caused temp still higher noise higher remarkable good still worse cooling dealing almost 600watts mention heating getting dumpe case heat component room cooling thing isnt selling point
5090 lot faster potential 4090 ti
almost like pure rasterization power plateauing way keep pumping performance pump power consumption price
post rnvidia youll get well ackshually even though spirit correct modest jump huge jump price power consumption exactly youd expect 4090ti redesigned core feature arent important performance power consumption make seem like mid gen refresh

5090 isnt gaming card ai tinkering card
could actually get rrp would totally get 5090 ill try disgusting resellers making actual price card go insane level make nope fuck
miss day flagship 300400 yeah inflation even adjusted inflationhttpsiimgurcomligvzphpng still absolutely jumped shark also acknowledge development process expensive labor gone 45x increase way decent paying full time job low cost living area supportive spouse even barely make argument midrange card point new am5 build 1600 13rd cost 7800xt

seems pretty much inline difference core count two card
dude 4k good test card even best cpu difference increase 8k
came someone watching closely title made think 5080 content see
upvotes
yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
day launch otherwise correct
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come
deleted
yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago

terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
got mine used last year 14k big w
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
guess going price like nvidia everybody elses interest
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus
deleted
well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
used 4090s warranty ifwhen connector melt
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
stock left chance going sale
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
3080 already better ps5
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
dx12 v dx11
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
fair 240v way efficient term resource installation cost allowing use smaller gauge wire
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
4080 assuming 16gb model 716 gb memory bandwidth pcie gen 4 connection 5080 960 gb pcie gen 5 connection case youre bad math 34 bandwidth updated pcie mean even better paired high speed m2 also two comment 4k good resolution gaming unless youre using big tv monitor uplift resolution doesnt offset performancesettings hit take youre using uw monitor 1440p oled high refresh rate highultra setting look significantly better take account motion secondly people monitor vram usage arent seeing utilization allocation youre running msfs requesting much vram get doesnt mean actually using oh bonus people dont upgrade every generation unless youre going tier afford intention upgrading every generation instead every every third build new pc every generation every 45 year youre making smartinformed choice part reason upgrade frequently
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
exactly look like 5090 33 better 4090 thanks 30 cuda core almost linear comparing 5070 4070s perform worse pure raster catchup ai stuff
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
sure mean
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote
part work 3d animation render gpus hence relevant u none term used particularly obscure happy help something isnt clear
mean knew going yikes saw 575w tdp didnt think itd actually hit 500w consistently though im surprised people dont take issue
yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
mean second hand market people upgrading
dumb
close release fishy indeed
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

mean fact come locked annoying already benchmark dropping nearly 100 watt cut performance 6 overall would make look worse 4090 keep power category annoying trend across industry
cope supposed new gen price jump gon na massive aibs looking 2300
one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid

interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
possibly wouldnt pay kind money used gpu warranty history melting connector
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story
never
youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

want good advertised sold 23 frame manufactured looking good hope wrong
ill sell mine
going want 5090 cant afford
update 4090
1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
sure a6000 48gb 7300
coming 2080s get dopamine another 5 year 5080 5070 would make sense upgrade
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation
ps5 pro frame generation insertion seen aidriven technology extend strictly upscaling project amethyst discussed fg amd backing high end gpu segment said moving focus back mainstream market place amd hope maintaining decent earnings issue plagued current generation top end offering misunderstand concern around machine learning ai im worried happening supplanting traditional rendering method im worried people going see gain 5090 4090 assume lower tiered card going similar raster rt gain likely nvidia pushed review 5080 far possiblelet 5090 review drop early 5070ti isnt even thing right want mindset cemented average buyer blackwell big jump ada well evidence contrary start appearing hell think dlss fsr4 finally get gamechanging technology come supplementing raw compute required traditional rendering method 6 year ago garbage 20series poorly received rt seen gimmick top poor priceperf improvement

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month

feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready

yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement

miss evga best havent personally heard direct sale notification queue im sure anyone intel wed like know im signed whatever get feel like im mostly going bet farm snagging launch minute pick notification never helped back 30 series fiasco
commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin
im restrospect shouldve shelled little bit 4090 cest la vie got enjoy powerful card rarely found wanting almost 3 year
genuinely relevant career youre making enough get ai workstation better yet private rack somewhere way prolevel card two thats stretch dont really need learn ai career there really lot edge case dont fall one two group
im nerd want im sure much use something like 5090 diy ai vast majority model likely going train run fine whatever right truly big boy stuff wont anything less data center small window want run train something big easier rent resource plus youd unable use machine anything else daysweeks
look like 3090 founder going 750900ish kinda range ebay moment id probably look local buyer kinda range though friend who 2070 super melted recently he making due brother old 1080 ti favor like watch dog free sometimes ill probably offer friend discount first especially since paid 500

honestly depends eyesight matter like people often assume eyesight normal got ta look screen
1440p 27 inch perfect chance ur gunna hit 240hz 4k display without ai frame genning upscaling shit low
27 4k look fantastic really high pixel density make everything super sharp clear baffle people people say waste 32 27 look even better 32 dont believe whole sweet spot nonsense 1440p 27 still look slightly pixelated ive got 32 27 4k moment popular size resolution past id never go 4k avoid
waste money
font look crisp mf
4k 27 inch crisp af highly recommend smaller screen smaller pixel
mindful 4k 240hz probably come sacrificing graphic quality running medium high setting instead maxing everything per game depending graphic card however big difference going 1440p 4k imo stick 4k always downscale game 1440p upscale monitor 1440p 4k
come entirely personal perception people take even bigger screen notice difference
8k waste money 4k isnt playing 4k pc since 2014 single screen huge difference compared 1080p
4k 144fps dream one doesnt care difference 144240
1440p ok 4k give really good pixel density 27 4k 27 screen work nice however pixel 34 3440x1440 screen give less fps
think also depends close monitor one people lean monitor id say somewhat worth like relatively far away also want 240fps wouldnt go 4k monitor either youre playing game graphically interesting anyway youll get better fps 1440p cheaper price also generally best bang buck going 4k 27inch use money better area
recently upgraded old hdtv monitor two 27 inch 1440p monitor amazing
first upgraded 27 1080p 27 4k 60hz monitor improvement night day bought 27 1440p 170hz second monitor gaming purpose 4070s honestly dont notice much difference 4k 1440p 27 refresh rate increase definitely noticeable
depends person person everyones eyesight different yes notice difference 4k 1440p 4k display bigger 1440p display otherwise put two 27 display front 4k 1440p wouldnt able tell difference thats everybody different best way answer question would go tech store see monitor display running game something see notice significant difference youve got friend 4k 27 monitor
still see individual pixel 1440p 27inch monitor guess 4k 27 would better
used 27 inch 4k 28 inch 4k best decision life
4k 27 ideal
lot text work besides gaming 100 worth ppi 4k 27 inch monitor really lot easier eye come text regret upgrade second however gaming rendering get 99 experience 4k 27 inch 1440p 27 inch better upgrade would 1440p oled monitor
4k nice productivity 2 browser open side side without 2nd monitor felt cramp 1440p monitor
use 28 4k work great

4k 27 inch try match pixel density macbook pro use work well also 27 inch 1440 monitor tell difference text work stuff wound never gaming 4k 1440 great
get 34 ultrawide highly recommend youll definitely feel difference
1440p 27 perfect imo
27 1440p sweet spot also get ultra wide 3440 x 1440 34 height 27 1440p
think 4k overrated least dlss may chase next big card every time keep newer 4k title later line dell 4k 240hz oled right 32 inch 800 900
getting 5080 playing 1080p 1440p waste money 5070ti enough 1440p 506070 1080p 4k 144hz165hz monitor bought pretty cheap nowdays always buy used want 240hz monitor game like cs2 id get decent 1080p 240360hz monitor secondary
yes
highly debated sweet spot 4k monitor size wouldnt go less 40 inch 4k display 1440p one 169 id go 27 inch
came mac far remember kind density standard 5k screen similar size really depends youre used
waste 27 1440p sufficient want save money personally 32 4k oled amazing im nowhere close hitting 240hz anything except thing like minecraft 4090
4k 27 look fantastic picked cheap ktc 4k 160hz 27 screen look amazingly good
1440p fine size get 1440p 240hz oled
cant argue 1440p 4k 27 waste money thing look really crisp detailed
youre rendering something youd appreciate extra pixel clarity would highly recommend 4k look 120165hz option rather 240
bought 4k 28 2015 still new novel found extra visual nice 1080p constantly issue application scaling especially text fast forward 2025 im using window 10 good reason update still issue application scaling correctly around 2018 bought predator x34 3440x1440 slightly lower pixel density much better panel overall extra width game changer many game even productivity performance never major issue ive almost generational upgrade top near top graphic card wont talk aspect use larger desk monitor mounted arm wall tend 2430 inch away screen may factor perceived pixel density go thats 4k tv look fantastic couch point inclined get another higher end panel 1440p guess ill looking 4k ultra wide im ready upgrade next high quality 10bit ip micro led oled panel look better mediocre va panel come fast movement hdr experience va panel poor black prone light bleed also seem motion blur higher fps
ask question said need rendering gaming wont need 5080 1440p gaming
2732 like perfect sweet spot singular monitor drop 1k oled 27 two week ago decided 1080p fine another year
nope super sharp love
depends close sit think 1440p 27 look pixel completely blended human eye 3 2 ft iirc regularly sit closer screen youll notice difference like sit back bit like 4ft wont see difference 1440p 4k
thought 1440 27 place one 10 year got 4k 27 165hz basically like retina display viewing distance also try new monitor swapping video card im running 2080ti getting great frame rate noticeable slowdown g syncfreesync even old gtx780 could 4k 8 year ago still playable frame rate
look fantastic
much vaseline smeared screen look newer game totally worth money sometimes play older game 4k 15 laptop display tbh feel better aliased edge
27 1440 fine rather going 4k could instead look better panel technology like hrd10 oled
ill say 1440p 34 inch 219 monitor similar ppi could crisp 2160p id probably like gpu would
waste money per se 27 hardly tell difference 4k 1440p without sitting 10 inch away monitor id personally prefer higher fps 1440p 27 display subjective suppose
4k waste money 240hz may
id rather 1440 ultra setting 4k mediumhigh setting difference negligible screen size
similar question 1440p 32 inch monitor know larger sweet spot maybe im loosing better experience
4k 27 crisp imho 27 great size viewed bit arm length
would probably look amazing
2160p 27 look better 1440p 27 gaming wouldnt say performance hit worth
ace gpu drive thing look bonkers good luck
bad eyesight 27 4k would waste money cant see pixel 1440p 27 inch
use 1660s never going back
prefer go 4k tv route ie sony bravia something comparable 4k least 43 preferable 49 55 one one hand get 5060fps input hand frameraterelated prettification handled tv hardware instead gpu fps 60 gpu likely fake anyway actually size 43 49 55 lot fun monitor 43 rest unused moving 55 actively used home pc 49 office work monitor
wanted 4k 27 oled bad looking monitor half year ago got 4k 32 oled instead would never go back 27 space fund go 4k 32
depends viewing distance sit close monitor chance 1440p ant 27 might start looking bit pixelated
want game 4k waste money recently downgraded 4k 1440p gpu 4070ti there definitely difference opinion tradeoff better quality optimum performance price difference 1440p monitor 4k actually quite large id rather constant high frame drop miss beautiful game used look specifically singleplayer game whatever preference go

oled hdr much bigger impact visual quality size chance youll plenty option budget youre looking 1440p plenty pixel density 27 anyway 4k really matter youre going bigger 16gb card anyway dlss get expensive jumping 4k youre better headroom pushing setting doable youre gaming tv since youre closer display youre better rendering 1440p pretty much time using dlaa even necessary 4k best youre going flagship want bigger screen want comfortable couch
gamewise dont see difference 4k 1440p 27 notice 4k glory 55
go store compare 2k 4k 27 inch people recommend 2k size difference might matter
there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though 32 nicer immersion 27 re watching video 1440p 27 4k 32 cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well 4k take lot gpu reach given fps 1440p therefore 4k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low 60 dont mind lowering quality setting 4k reasonable 40805080tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went 32 4k ip 160hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text 27 1440p ip havent seen 27 4k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though

someone normal eyesight difference noticeable worth money since people dont even normal eyesight id say 32 almost mandatory appreciate 4k properly
sitting 27in away screen screen 27in diagonal human eye resolution maximum something like 56 pixel per degree youre looking something 27 youd need 72 wide screen max whole field view youd barely able see single pixel
6950 xt lg c1 4k keep thing 2k 4k seem nearly much improvement higher frame rate tell difference dont care oled isnt good want look text youre using mostly gaming incredible im sure television better used
productivity ive using 27 4k 60hz monitor never go back gaming 1440p 27 165hz never change sure help gaming taste high frame rate dont care 4k
1440p 27inch high refresh rate low latency thats best bang buck imo
4k 27 give awesome pixel density
id snag 32 27 nice waste money
kind size 4k hate large monitor yeah waste money
personal preference ive running dual 1440p without issue
computer good monitor attached get 5070 current gpu run game fine 1080 1440 5070 needed go 4k want experience better graphic otherwise whats point
like 4k 32 inch 125 scaling 1440p 27 inch 100 scaling perfect
personal perference got 4k 32 oled wish 27 4k oled available upgraded thing burn 35 year im definitely replacing 27 4k
27 id go 1440p
size go 4k probably scale display output letter wont readable small use 1440p 27 pretty much perfect 4k id consider something like 32

maybe 4k 144 itll cheaper
im sure look great
end depend gon na hardware got productivity really benefit 4k 27 text super sharp feel easy read gaming kinda 5050 feel kinda worth sacrifice fps really sharp image plan go rtx 5080 think card playing 4k 27 kinda non issue really waste money
first step wait till thursday 95 chance wont get rtx 5080 msrp anyways bot already established last 3 generation nvidia gpus free version hit market considering authentication method online purchase bestbuyamazonnewegg odds securing one slim none
certainly necessary went 43 4k 27 4k felt like got significant upgrade resolution
youre looking pixel density smaller 4k waste went 28 acer nitro 4k 144hz 49 samsung odessy g9 5120x1440 screen died within 2 week honestly ultrawide nice immersive picture quality wise 4k cant beat im waiting upgrade oled spec nitro
eye good condition
really need 240hz 144hz 4k monitor thats pretty great unless youre nerfing video setting modern game playing older less demanding game youre going get close 240hz 4k anyway even frame gen dlss 4 would defeat purpose 4k gaming entirely dont forget take double compute process 4k v 1440 im interested oled screen higher refresh rate 4k 100fps great 4k personally
buy pretty good oled 14404k like less 6700 dollar long dont expect super high refresh rate 165120 honestly refresh rate adequate 14404k
im going get 2732 4k monitor year sure wan na go oled miniled yet
would argue 240hz 4k lot waste money 4k 27in
assume oled necessary depends much money seeing 200 maybe might well go 4k especially newer 27 4k 240hz displayport 21 mean output full spec without dsc dsc really reduce quality complication like occassional blackscreen weird issue multiple monitor dealbreaker running without dsc ideal note qhd 360hz panel also need dsc ip others ehh probably need lol
meh 4k overrated 2k gaming still sweet spot ive 2k 34in since 3080 ti loving
vote go 1440p 27 going difficult hit high refresh rate 4k unless one like 10 game use dlss4 frame gen crap
waste prefer 1440p oled good refresh rate however 4k awesome consuming content dont like game
thats amazing
id go 1440p noticeable difference 1080p expensive honestly feel like see difference 4k monitor 1440p monitor 27 inch even 32 lying
1440p 27 current sweet spot save money 4k favor higher hz
think 1440p higher frame better personally thats though 4k game tv would make monitor 4k unless 5090 even maybe wouldnt hate dlss shit even 4090 struggle maintain 60 title maxed 4k struggling title within year release imagine happen 5090 well game get demanding definitely happen 5080 quality high frame responsive 4k gaming honestly myth mostly new release title 10 year 4k era console still mostly render shit 1080p scale run game 30fps game arent demanding sure run astro bot 4k 60z congrats super mario galaxy finally 4k impressive technical feat shit decade old see fallout 4 skyrim course better pc front mean like said current top dog struggle without using cheater frame 0 shame good 1440p monitor even best industry build
get 120hz 144hz 4k hisense tv use monitorboss mode
imo yes pixel density high look pixel density bought 275 inch 4k monitor returned usually recommended get 3132 inch monitor least
ye kinda wasted space perfect 1440p tho
depends waht oyu really practical multitasking software designed 1080p screen practically 4 screen oyu windowed
play 1440 ultra worth price negligible increase resolution even top end gpus barely break 100fps 4k lot game id rather trade fraction less noticeable resolution way fps
1440p 27 inch sweet spot opinion
lot go decision play game 4k well really depends art style game want play pull game game 4080 play helldivers ark ascended cod game known graphic fidelity going play game meant look unrealistic artistically like marvel rival comic style instance probably dont need 5080 dont get 5080 intend go resolution lower 4k either doubt 5080 pull 240hz lot modern title nature 4k gaming always run monitor lower refresh rate cap frame rate
imo yes yes small 3234 better
4k maybe working sharp eye dont see pixel font gaming 27 1440p ideal
yes use 75 4k tv
ive 27 1440p 7 year recently got 4k 32 lg oled night day love 4k clarity oled top tier
youre planning buy nongaming purpose better 4k 60hz 32inch monitor price difference isnt much 27 32 inch monitor youre planning buy gaming purpose go 1440p high refresh rate monitor neither high refresh 4k monitor graphic card drive decent price performance ratio
waste 4k would fruitful 32 inch display wont feel 1440p lacking 27 inch display perfect
2k monitor 4k make font small
absolutely
personal guide 1440p 27 4k 32 there reason spend necessary 1440p delivers really good clarity 27 also would much rather put money towards 1440p oled panel rather 4k ip panel
4k necessary 1440p fine
1440p oled sweet spot
yes
eh depends want 1440p look really good 27 inch monitor youd lose lot performance going 4k
find samsung odyssey neo g7 4k 32in mini led around 600 time sale pretty nice 4k monitor led full oled aa expensive gpus like mentioned one happy
people spend 10 smoke crack people spend 10 cigarette people spend 10 eat week money relative use money monitor crack cigarette
1440p seems like great compromise high refresh rate resolution 4k look good hell 1080p 1440p quite decent upgrade aswell thats obviously lot higher chance get 144 fps 1440p screen 4k one 1440p 240hz oled really want go
waste however id rather take higher framerate 1440p v extra resolution size youre sitting desk 27 optimal
someone 4k 27 display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display 144hz lot game especially modern one hit 144fps consistently run 3070 far worst gpu definitely also best gaming 4k said hindsight id gotten 32inch pixel density high cant make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use 150 display scaling im working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen 1440p monitor size set 125 im getting math wrong wont impact game ui element window program like excel get away 125 smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything isnt tiny
work text youll notice huge difference 4k really need around 5k reach density pixel disappear cant imagine working 1440 screen id say thats valuable day day 240hz refresh rate
potential waste rest system isnt snuff
dont really want spend extra 1440p 27 fine
probably see doubt itd big difference
27 inch multi monitor desk though never actually game dabbled past im pcvr type found happy 1440p gaming smooth high fps thing coudlnt stop getting annoyed colour banding tiny text much density screen fit scale text size etc thats really think 4k make difference 27 inch screen size dont know color banding sio correct term describing beause scale set letter eg x may 7 pixel tall cleartype add colour pixel try smooth colour pixel realy stick like sore thumb im sitting front monitor make matter worse finally hit magic age range experience joy presbyopia reading galsses becoming necessary small close little detail exacerbates colour banding small text even
think 1440p way go personally play competitive game highest re get away without putting massive disadvantage
1440p 27 inch youll get lot frame able go higher graphic id recommend personally
desktop use 4k 27 need fractional scaling doesnt really work well 100 small 200 big qhd perfect resolution pc use
27 4k 27 1440p difference definitely noticeable whether worth id personally say isnt worth gaming performance hit significant diminishing return productivity different story text much clearer performance hit isnt really relevant desktop use
5080 waste arent running 4k reccomend least 32 inch 4k good luck getting gpu though
ive got 34 inch 4k find 27 inch 2k look better cant see pixel either would say 2k 27 inch enough get nice ip oled 27 inch 2k resolution good better 4k much less expensive
dont think need 240hz resolution maybe could get 4k 120hz144hz much cheaper
yes
4k give really crisp graphic game got eye also give lot desktop realestate thats bit dependent small like thing window scaling option use got 49 dqhd effectively like 2x32 1440p monitor side side realestate plentiful wouldnt way also got another pc exclusively used 75 4k tv screen mostly work application 3d modeling rendering video editing nice 329 multimonitor probably better still beat shit 1440p wouldnt even consider work 1080p screen ew
waste money want high pixel density want give better image quality
27 inch opinion waste sticking lcd oled maybe
like thing objective truth human eye cant see 300ppi 12 distance lot people hold phone face fun fact 1080p 7 phone 12 inch away 312ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible 300ppi 12 inch 1 foot 36 3 foot would devisible 3 100ppi 3 foot mean 3 foot 100ppi look exactly 300ppi 12 inch 3 foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef 2 foot would 150ppi 4 foot would 75ppi equivalent 4k 27 ppi 163 meaning equivalent 450ppi 12 seeing 3 foot away 1440p 27 ppi 108 3 foot away look like 324ppi human eye cant see 300ppi 1440p equivalent 324 4k equivalent 450 meaning 0 difference anyone see viewing distance 3 foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good 2020 vision people dont reality people probably cant even see 300ppi 12 let honest u looking screen 247 eye perfect case based math alone 4k 27 screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
used 27 4k monitor 2 year used mix productivity gaming also briefly owned 32 4k monitor returned week unrelated question defect wouldnt say waste wasnt best choice gaming often chose play game 1440p simply game playing didnt enough fine detail make difference game lot text onscreen element benefitted 4k great however many game play dont personally think 1440p monitor better choice gaming size 27 maybe 32 beyond think 4k might better choice lot people say 4k 32 ideal theyre probably right honestly didnt find 4k 32 much better 2010 vision better 2020 last eye exam honestly dont see much difference 1440 4k 32 sure look see better detail thing doesnt anything come immersed game found setting game 1440p get fps said 27 32 4k monitor terrific productivity would hesitate get either size 4k productivity work benefit
nah really good office work manageable 32 office find
bought 4k160 monitor less 400 usd using year
gaming maybe rendering text video editing afford tight budget 1440p fine
upscaling frame gen tech right would suggest get much resolution refresh rate upscaled frame gen 120 fps 4k always look better 1440p 60 fps native
16 4k macbook never waste definitely get value larger monitor always waste
1440p 27 inch
triple monitor setup 3x 4k 28 run 4090 runslooks fantastic supported singlearmstand free ton desk space
240hz even mouse cursor browser scrolling sooo smooth also many older simpler game hit 240fps problem 4k there way go back 1440p go

1440p sweet spot monitor gaming playing 55 tv larger sure 4k pretty nice 27 monitor difference see performance drop
really liked 4k 27 stick 2k one difference noticeable put monitor side side unplug 4k one stop noticing difference quite quickly used two 4k 27 swapped 2k 32 2k 27 difference least noticeable come gaming 27 inch youll scale desktop ui 150 youre getting desktop space compared 2k monitor anyway looking hit 240hz youll happier 2k monitor since year gpu might able handle high fps cap newer game guess reason might want 4k 27 monitor handle lot text excel table daily definitely look sharper 4k monitor better eye still crazy quickly get used 2k monitor ive using one work year ive never needed image sharper come gaming definitely waste money
id say afford go 4k system comfortably run go definitely waste system struggle obviously going waste 27 1440p oled cant justify upgrade 4k personally prefer get performance 1440p rather 4k resolution
wouldnt buy priority might different would stick 1080 maybe 1440 size look fine better able maintain stable frame rate time set resolution 1080 1440 well get result still option 4k wanted use
27 4k 144fps monitor love used 27 5k imac anything less 27 4k would felt much like downgrade
build recently went 27 1440 7800xt ridiculously good im sure refresh rate zero interest type competitive game single player game awesome
get 1440p unless always buy expensive graphic card wont reach high fps number anyway 1440p sweet spot gaming right imo also 4k monitor third monitor watch video film

mmm 4k 27 would bit optimal ppi 163 4k 27 main problem 240hz wont getting 4k card would better find 144hz monitor
1440p 27 sweet spot opinion
price vary region region may moot point 27 1440p oled 27 4k lcd looking oled anyway 1440p 27 enough pixel density imo allow gpu longer usable lifespan
38 ultra wide recommended best
waste neccesary opinion 27 1440p really good enough people us 4k look better dont think isnt noticeable much come value wont bad screen 1440p best would look possible decide price difference worth experience difference situation difference much important
1440p absolute max would 27
yes get 49inchultra wide dont listen anyone else telling otherwise
yes waste money anyone say otherwise idea talking 4k 27 basically imperceptible normal viewing distance setting fps hit take negates possible value get oled 34 uw height 27 wider price less 240hz 4k monitor oled high refresh uw experience massively better
never higher resolution always better hardware handle 15 1440p hdr oled portable monitor quite small 15 image quality insane see pixel screen regardless distance
depends sitting 21 inch away monitor
degree yes also keep mind 4k ultra 5080 latest game unplayable even dlss stick 1440p sweet spot

2k27 display look great text little small especially view 6m image text clarity small pixel pitch fantastic underrated category imo
would suggest 1440p 27 pixel density already look good cash get oled monitor 144hz 4k great tv bigger display want high pixel density went 1500 deep getting lg 45 widescreen 240hz oled 3440x1440 look amazing use pc alot definitely worth
27 odyssey g7 4k 144hz absolutely worth game downscale 1440 movie easy run game 4k beautiful

27 im still using 1080p upto 27 1080p upto 40 inch 2k 50 inch 4k remember gpu start tank performance 1080p
personally think 27inch 4k overkill pixel density wasted id never million year recommend 4k 27 4k 32 extra size really nice experience difference ppi negligible perfect vision last tested november
absolutely giant waste money wont able tell difference 4k 1440p 99 time able tell difference medium graphic 45fps ultra graphic 120fps 4k make sense 32 youre sitting really close 32 screen edit sorry thought looking 4080 still think 1440p ultra ray tracing 240 fps oled monitor better option get 4k urge get 32 screen enjoy sitting back little haha
4k gaming meme nothing run high movie
4k mostly better 32 inch 27 still isnt bad even 1080p

difference 1440p 4k going negligible gaming size distance however 4k monitor far superior term productivity multitasking movie tv streaming video etc go 4k
still dont understand there cross play game console player simply isnt competing 45 series 240hz monitor
blindness 32 4k overkill thats wanted
also viewing distance everyone monitor distance eye
really depends type game play could oldernostalgic game quake halflife doom game arent graphically demanding anymore today standard feel like people often forget aspect debating 4k240hz

think main disadvantage 1440p text clarity look much better 4k also esport title probably get 240 fps 4k
""
except he getting 50series actually access tech pretty much every reviewer concluded even performance upscaling 4k new algorithm good better native taa mention 4x frame generation additional latency relative 2x already decent tradeoff high base frame rate actually worth turning frame rate

wish could upvote felt like got scammed reddit went 1080p 24 1440p 27 spent like 500 monitor could hardly notice difference lost lot fps definitely sweet spot gone 4k couldve perfectly downscaled 1080p fps game 27 downscaling 4k isnt nearly bad would 32 expand even reluctantly went lg c3 65 tv even though reddit said get big possibly handle glad didnt notice pixel 65inch bother sometimes glad didnt go bigger pixel density anything
looking 27 4k available back sounded like people coping 32 4k best would preferred 27 4k much imo half reason people probably wowd 4k oled 32 higher ppi compared 27 1440p 27 4k would even crisp

waste benefit 4k increased screen real estate multiple window etc display scaling fill screen pixel sharper icon text guess thats cool suppose one thing lot apps dont implement display scaling well two remove main benefit high resolution display gaming situation even worse youre sacrificing precious frame slightly improved sharpness guess people really good vision able pull 32 screen 4k scaling thats pretty rare comfortable use sweet spot comfortable use 4k native resolution without scaling really 37 45 inch unless youre one people love nice crisp desktop icon guess
work scale everything native 4k 11 scaling 27 would make letter like 23 mm tall unreadable yes get crispier text worth price considering need gpu monitor
could op mentioned 4k 240hz want hitting 240hz may possible 4k depending game course whereas 1440p would better chance could play 1440p 4k monitor ive heard people say look much worse native 1440p extra money spent 4k could go towards better quality 1440p better colour accuracy could important mentioned rendering better hdr capability etc buy 4k monitor play 1440p get refresh rate want id say waste money guess personal preference 1440p monitor better quality screen would personally better use money 4k monitor couldnt actually utilise however personally colour accuracy brightness contrast hdr etc important resolution u notice thing different degree one person 1440 v 4k 27 noticeable slightly worse colour accuracy could night day opposite true people guess really answer question need know game op plan playing resolution aiming feature monitor important plus budget would help
said wast sure wast maybe
4k 27 inch 34 inch ultra wide 3440x1440 honestly see difference mainly fps counter text video obviously better gaming nowhere near worth performance loss
daddy like see 163 ppihttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcmonitorcomments1dx8q07referencetableforpixelsperinchfordifferent

4k 120144hz common within reasonable price range considering buyer already buying 5080
let honest lot people still play game older simpler definitely hit high fps good enough pc
interesting point regret refresh rate
went 4k felt like wasting 4070 ti super 1080 gaming wow certainly night day every screen life look like cheap toy
he getting 5080
jump pixel density often higher 1440p 4k 1080p 1440p look popular screen size respective ppi lot time see people go small 1080p screen big 1440p screen actually lose pixel density
1 1080p 2k 1440p 25k 2 25k 78 pixel 2k 100 3 4k 225 time pixel 25k roughly 4 time 2k
golden rule pixel density phone tablet much higher 27 4k youre fine actually enjoy
swear oled screen making blinder everyday
many people like work mainly play factorio demanding game play moment maybe elite icarus
4k relevant resolution game feel like game would perfectly fine 1440p240hz well
one buy 5080 play doom want play newer game
smooth cursor get enough love opening menu window glorious 240hz
old as bought logitech superlight 2 cant handle 4000 polling refresh rate nevermind 8000 haha
wdym used frame gen doesnt feel much smoother j look smoother think something nature ai gen yea
also ever need downsize resolution whatever reason 1080p upscales 4k panel pixel perfect scaling 1080p scaled 1440p panel always look blurry
ur playing competetive game run ur shit low setting 1440p 1080 240fps 27 inch 24 1080 monitor shit ur playing story game could usable
mean acting like zero downside way oversimplifying bit
awhile seeing little nuance ai generated frame get annoying completely immersion breaking noticed much icarus leaf pas face storm there trail leaf behind actual rendered leaf dlss future jensen think
found guy playing tetri 1060 ti
240hz 1440p monitor relatively affordable money u save cheaping refresh rate nowadays like next nothing
tv care far away sitting desk youre going sitting spot regardless monitor get going big possibly handle seems like dumb advice course reddit could never
almost got 27 1440p went microcenter realized still pretty pixelated got 4k one 100 totally worth
24 inch 1440p sweet spot 27 inch 4k next one
really got first 4k screen 2011 28 werent many bigger thought 32 recent way ive understood people insisted 1440p good 27 dont notice 4k upgrade course false
fine people say good cheaper alternative people argue better mythical sweet spot
125 window top head think since scaling issue
dont daft
idea issue scaling ive using 4k well decade never problem gaming yeah youre giving frame sharpness way youre giving frame sharpness choosing 1440p 1080p 1080p 720p
scale window scaling fine year
look much worse native 1440p nah look bit smudge slightly still better 1080p 4k monitor still better 1080p monitor people like dramatize
dlss would look much better native 1440p without much 5080 definitely push enough pixel 4k definitely waste money id also prioritize hdr nice color screen size high ppd nice one lowest priority imo played 42 screen bit hard imagine going back anything smaller
thought said weast lol
know typo meant west money op better east money
remember 1080p 32 big buck
weird 1080p 24 inch exactly ppi 1440p 32 inch
general sweet spot generally per person owning 27 4k screen wont go 1440p 27 24 1440p perfect people tend listen others instead testing monitor personally test monitor dont like got sell try something different 24 monitor rare af reason amazing size 1440p would love try 24 4k would think would new sweet spot 4k
yeah mr magoo came dumbass sweetspots look phone like 34x pixel density got think resolution good play counter strike sure 1440p enough need everything crisp fuck without using aliasing 4k high ppi way go sitting 32 4k cant wait til day come buy decent 8k 32
still see pixel 27 inch 1440p
know mean ive rocking 1060 since 1000 series came built new machine black friday radeon 7800 xt new hardware plus real monitor insane
noticeably higher ppi 1080p 24 giving significantly larger screen easier sustain higher refresh rate highultra setting especially people without flagship gpus dont like upscaling
still 4090 1 card existence thats better lot people value frame resolution
apology dont know freedom unit
mr money bag playing home theater
dwf software updated user dw software update done dell also dwf cheaper quieter
cheaper quieter updatable freesync work nvidia gpus
upgraded gpu easily able push 240 frame many game would love able see ive also running game 1440p performance cyberpunk look good still
right talk experience noob begin calculate shit care matter getting good comeback
mixture density screen size 50 inch big screen size average pixel density 42 inch bigger screen size average pixel density 32 inch perfect screen size pixel density ratio 27 inch smaller screen size average pixel density 24 inch small screen size excellent pixel density 32 inch tends best pixel density screen size ratio op asked specific question 27 inch probably waste money 4k need factor parameter size didnt matter might well go find 4k tablet screen use window 24 inch 4k screen
likewise im hitting 4k 144hz vast majority game play tho time cant remember last time bought aaa game backlog big enough without adding
thats simply true though could play type game plan least week played gow ragnarok 4k around 80ish fps played nine sol 4k locked 240 fps
1500 3000 sweet spot sure
got fancy skyrox v8 still keep 1000 hz polling rate battery life modern sensor pretty much perfect reason get new mouse weight shape
get smooooooth mouse desktop
j buy 27 inch 240hz 1440p monitor op arent expensive sweet spot
would ever downsize 1440p 27 inch monitor
1440p 4k monitor still look better 1080p 4k monitor thou adding undecision p
240hz completely unnecessary true much id rather picture quality see refresh rate cant
id rather 4k144 1440p240
holy shit jumped 4k 2011 remember making leap 2014 samsung dropped 590d 4k monitor moved 27 1080p monitor difference crazy good
agree never seen ever see 27 4k stupid waste
httpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistancehttpswwwrgbcomdisplaysizeresolutionandidealviewingdistance daft said
yeah youre keeping game window small least big monitor youre getting better exoerience frame sharpness isnt really benefit increased resolution allows larger size thing desktop environment could way workspace area use larger screen sharper text icon dont really make much difference 4x working area
yeah everything much taa post processing day plus resolution higher integer scaling doesnt matter much anymore basically 99 console game nativeinteger scaled become pretty accepted
ah ok ive never experienced going ive heard though ive definitely experienced people dramatising sub whole 8gb vram isnt enough argument one majority people still 1080p 1080p 8gb vram still sufficient
kind compass reading lad
waist money say
sick reference bro
weast maybe likely weast
used old sony tv 1080p 32 goddamn shit great still going strong mom planned gift new tv every review ive seen samsung big brand always die soon warranty expires im even considering getting gaming monitor instead last way longer already gifted apple tv cable company us device decode signal there barely loss functionality
bedroom tv 1080p 32 least led lcd actually horrible main living room tv last year went 32 4k qled hdr slight upgrade
yeah youd want crispier image need processing power otherwise youd spend money better gpuor get worse performance fidelity
correct look like absolute garbage pixel size thumb
100 agreed there stark contract gamers cant tell difference programmersdesigners regularly look huge ppi number apple studio 5k 27 look crisp anyone saying 27 1440p similar wrong doesnt best vision begin fact care far far less fps eye cant detect 60 v 240 resolution ppi modern gpus could run 8k 27 would heartbeat want monitor ppi iphone
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway imo 1440p high re worth going 4k detrimental performance slight definitely perceptible visual gain
look phone like 34x pixel density also lot closer face higher pixel density make sense
also function distance screen
lot people dont redditors act like use case computer gaming 4k144 huge upgrade notice gaming mainly general computer use people 80 time op asked waste money imo isnt
arrange lesson fellow countryman might direct freedom
monitor cost 300
yall crazy variable dpi button go like 300350400450500 lol
hence im recommending 240hz 1440p instead 240hz 4k u still get smoothness
yeah chasing 4k60 good moved 1440p 144hz ultrawides started hitting market always missed 4k soon 32 144hz 4k screen came grand jumped
im still 1080 brah
deleted
one sir
yeast money wish
worst maybe worst money spent
tv ai smart tv bullshit baked theyre horrible
samsung killing steamlink app apparant reason
luckily samsung odessy g9 died 2 week got money back final confirmation never trust samsung
34 ultrawide 1440p look great
mean 32 inch 1440p isnt bad sit 3 foot away look pretty good wouldve gone 4k 2070s didnt seem worth thing would fitted nongaming stuff primarily game upgrade gpu ill get 4k monitor run dual monitor setup anyways still quite good reading text day id probably notice game movie fine
yeah guy argue 4k 1440p isnt big difference sits 3 foot away totally missing actual point seeing difference regular distance regarding ppi phone clarity s24 ultra insane compared monitor
slight man difference huge 22x amount pixel play fast paced shooter probably doesnt matter strategy moba rts game want visual clarity live without also dlss good cant tell difference native dlss whats problem add thing gaming 4k shine text one major factor saw text 4k looking jagged line 1440p make want even higher re
let real 4k modern game youre probably throwing dlss anyway yes dlss effective higher output resolution dlss performance 4k usually look better 1440p dlss quality even native 1440p
yes point see pixel arm length monitor thats talking sit 2 meter monitor would probably look phone truly assumed going conversation people understand talking perceived difference image clarity
length arm
op specifically mentiones point whole upgrade gaming would recommend something general use work never asked
could definetly use send tank slovakia might look like democracy pretty much orbns hungary way become new belarus russia
foot inch
thems sniper setting
adjust mouse sensitivity window setting well also gaming ingame sensitivity one person may 400 dpi 25 sensitivity another may 2000 dpi 5 sensitivity could effectively thing personally lean toward higher dpi lower ingame sensitivity keep outofgame speed consistent
eww gross pixelated cursor
like tiger baby
get smoooooooth mouse fuzzy text 4k240 smoooooooth mouse text
nice using 2728 4k 60hz tnips monitor decade finally upgraded 42 lg c3 oled 4k 120hz love one day ill move 4k 240hz better hdr thatll
could yeet money wish enough money yeet
thats set pihole
daaaamn luckily got money back 4 year ago bit short money got used monitor friend prolly used 2 year brand mtek amazingly enough thats still holding even passed lil brother work like charm 1080p 144hz va curved dead pixel 6 year gaming perfect day amazing color accuracy va tho low brightness great environment lot natural lighting
thats thing slight depending distance youre sitting monitor pixel density difference mean nothing youre sitting 8 foot away 4k television whole basis opinion founded upon sit 3035 inch monitor distance 4k display would make extremely marginal difference massive performance hit
iirc distance used calculate sweet spotssize 3 foot monitor larger away pixel discernible find 4k tv silly im playing game tv living room throw 1440p even though like 55 inch im sitting 7 foot away
good luck comrade
would happily trade freedom unit 556 55 grain ball dispersed indiscriminately occupying force made adhd 19 year old american didnt get college natural resource

oh mean already responded person xd
yeah usually prefer low speed game hard adjust since usually something like 04 lol
va version odyssey noticed lighting issue hopefully find decent 4k 144hz oled soon enjoy hell acer
there visual fidelity detail inability resolve individual pixel though say nothing increased workspace available 4k display answer always depends use case
natural resource produce car per caput world need volkswagen
4k 27 inch also allows comfortably use 200 scaling lose advantage bigger workspace rely apps dont proper high dpi support integer scaling look better blurry fractional scaling integer scaling also useful certain older game dont work properly high resolution
oh bonus point took long realize couldnt post new cpu bios 2019 fact new enough recognize chip 2014 24
got assassin x 120 thats waiting 5700x3d thats mail noticed plastic first thought whod forget remove guess know congrats though much x3d get
forgetting take plastic cover cooler actually common mistake may think cant tell many post sub ive seen talking ended problem took apart think happens make clear plastic think really dumb make color people see better like black message bold red letter saying remove installing
upgraded 5700x3d weekend almost forgot take plastic cooler despite mount upside clearly visibleyoure alone friend
make mistake lol forget plastic cover set glass tile floor first big pc build ordered case small cpu cooler still large new case got didnt seat ram way either
there thing future proof either help
2 day ago gifemotefreeemotespackfacepalm
congrats one u struggled fix thing hour end realize something stupid easy fix top list thing check
actually latest build felt like idiot common one forgetting one extra power cable like cpu one one gpu gpus post without extra power soon make gpu require juice system crash
happens sometimes u learn slowly meaning ive done twice part swap felt six rig far move part multiple time top thing saved plastic shield covered thermal paste reminder clearly didnt work first time theyre pinned bulletin board build constant reminder idiocy
building 30 year done
liking 5700x3d got one coming replace 5500 im hoping good increase performance playing x4 foundation crippling cpu
need break tempered glass panel bingo card full
common mistake unfortunately there even post prebuilt whose cpu cooler still sheet getting new aio replace old one failing pump already postit note reminding remove sheet
probably common mistake first pc build ive seen many meme impossible miss
managed plug cpu fan pump fan pumpfan cpu cooling long session id get warning temperature clue
also upgraded 3700x 5700x3d kept wealth prism cooler internet said fine x3d doesnt pull 100w havent gone mid 70 max load yet
went 3600x stock wraith spire cooler 5800x3d tried using wraith 5800x3d load thermal throttled recommend
age many people refuse even admit made mistake salute honest idiot
last pc build could life figure wouldnt boot motherboard wasnt even getting power several hour testing caved brought pc repair shop paid stranger 200 plug motherboard power supply
happens enjoy new build
aint much honest work
relate upgraded cpu tested posted fine upgraded ram wouldnt post switched old ram still post switched ram different slot reseated cpu still post realized ram button slightly loosed apparently dont elbow grease push ram stick moral ram stick click doesnt mean clicked

ive seen worse could one story sat cpu bending every single pin
somewhat offtopic anyone know deepcool ak400 suffice cooling 5700x3d
lol exact thing 3 week ago
well least discovered new form thermal insulation honestly plasticcooled new category weve man prop sharing
always baffle many people talk missing dont get clearly visible coming someone forgets io shield time bent pin cpu first pc built
missed decade
make feel better despite knowing full well parent aio 2008 technically didnt meet requirement window 11 spent whole day trying shoehorn anyways knew possible get around requirement done try toil trying different method prepare install medium happened upon obscure bit information newest win 11 build dropped sse41 requires sse42 unfortunately t5850 core dual doesnt supportunderstand sse42 instruction physically impossible run win 11 core dual system thorough clean repaste throwing cheap ssd perfectly usable win 10
solve buy new cpu update bios mobo capability flash
mean mistake limit long mobo sale wrong bios
im guy even looked right proceeded add way improper installation facebook marketplace actually fellow genius tell bought first made way motherboard time findam5 motherboard tell took box never installed 120 cooler 30 mugen 6 also marketplace one definitely new twist tie still fan everything oh fucking sticker
dont think people look see sticker take box think wait remove im put doesnt get dirty youre 50 minute build isas alwayslonger expected take finally time put heatsink pick hold upright meaning one chance see sticker table there little plastic tab could see except youre busy focusing heatsinks proprietary mounting contraption making sure oriented correctly guess could make plastic tab bright color would help

ive using various item month realizing plastic film meant peeled sometimes difficult see
yeah plastic covershttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcsearchqplasticcoverrestrictsronsortrelevancetall bane first time builder
feel seen
future resistant haha
im honored first way doubt last either easily ridiculous though
sound familiar
retrospect shouldve kept mine similar reminder hobby though
im happy far hasnt eyeopening oh god difference game play finetogood 1440p anything frame consistent maybe could turn pretty stuff setting didnt good job beforeafter benchmarking granted also added 16gb total 32gb ram time thats part gathered jump would bigger mine say dont forget better cooler take stupid plastic thing update bios
managed yet beyond
honestly could kept well within limit loud fuck though especially case full 200mm fan
mine never throttle surprisingly even plastic haha prism probably adequateifbarely could kept working as noticeable 92cm fan buzz along high rpm basically silent case
appreciate
ohhhh
ive definitely done
crazy often stuff work barely really shouldnt
oooof
like said surprisingly effective
missed saw accepted responsibility forgot
clearly day
op need coffee
10 second halted trying understand parent aio couldnt handle w11 one watercooler
put 3700 back downloading new bios flash drive booting
oh processor cooler ram new part bought board new 2019 dont think ive updated bios since
damn 120 steal enjoy build
thing realised moment screwed cooler took back yup there plastic ive repasted replaced dozen cooler year worked sysadmin helpdesk etc
nearly exactly happened
give time top spent quite awhile trying figure pc wasnt turning remember turned switch back psu disconnecting everything lol
rain pours friend happens whenever start feeling cocky
weve buddy dont worry chip self emolate sketchy af praise modern cpu architecture
youre wrong
help thats thought progressive parent use water cooling
hey also upgrading 3700x 5700x3d update bios make compatible 5700x3d still boot pc 3700x install 5700x3d right new cpu coming day wondering whether update bios
oh amonce fog brain fart cleared thanks
feel like ive probably done
still work perfectly fine updating compatibility list changing
im looking literally thing posting remember check back answer though using raytracing
resolution frame rate
call duty mess overall number game add rt even close use wide range program 4080s stable driver timeouts xtx end especially dx12 application dont take word make sure wherever get card return edit rt getting baked new game
4080 better gpu rasterized performance difference two gpus less 5 meaningless meanwhile 4080 offer far superior feature set let play wider variety game ultra setting consuming less power 7900 xtx make sense want save money reason dont want 4070 ti super either
xt absolutely love amount spent long ive card buying today posted price would go 4080s due dlss knowing least foreseeable future 7000 series getting fsr4
xtx easier one find normal price everywhere looked 4080 super stock
u dont care rt pretty obvious answer 7900 xtx dlss good enough add almost 200 euro worth money top
youre eyeing go steamos route following year linux better support amd card
httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32htmlhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx4080superfoundersedition32html 7900xtx barely advantage raster dlss really good
hmmm 180 better rt dlss xtx better performance vrams tough call dont plan upgrading 5 year xtx probably better deal vrams hold longer 40 series software plan upgrading within 23 year youd probably get better visual experience 4080s time frame
1440p pure raster pretty evenly matched although 4080super energy efficient dont care ray tracing go less expensive option
got 7900xtx sapphire pulse first time amd buyer realized immediately amd person nvidia software awful unusable amd software useable actually useful card quiet cool destroys game want play using 1440p rivalscspoe2retail wow also aaa ray trace path trace 60 gps gamer like frame far amd amazing
thing im going say based experience choice might use dlss every game play available frame gen one hell help dont care latency unless fps 60 without fg another thing like raytracing thats prefer nvidia
dlss 40 looking real deal people raving fidelity fps normally look real frame per second thats solid number rely new 40 making rethink stance benchies gntechpowerup etc look thermal power consumption 5080 might giving buddy 7900xt slotting 5080 pc xtx great card denying demolishes 1440 handle vast majority 4k use casesrtpath trace exception thats nvidias playground resale softwaredrivers nvidia make sense 180 euro spread kinda muddies water tho get xtx badass m2 ssd saving call maybe
even get 7600x3d anymore id go 4080s price isnt much fsr4 way far away dont think itll even match dlss3
100 4080s near equal rasterization dlss4 imho stable driver support better resale value
7900 xtx amd better raw faster performance dlss fake frame also nvidia stock going amd better market value
youre 1440p think better go cheaper spend peripheral want better gpu overall 4080super
assuming theyre price 4080 super better gpu current price difference 300500 7900 xtx much better buy get 7900 xtx 850950 whereas lowest ive seen lately 4080 super 1250
4080 super dlss 4 game changer maybe 5070 ti
7900xtx vram cheaper age better fuck nvidia go amd
considering 4080 get new dlss id go nvidia
im using 7900 xtx 4k 120 hz good visually expect put head head 4080 number wont good visuals end amd driver ancillary software much less fussy install nvidia
big thanks everyone opinion would preferred 4080 super one found stock price go pretty quickly reputable brand point already budget build would quite frankly start break bank im settling 7900xtx keeping eye open future upgrade
id get xtx personally unless really care nvidia feature dont
rtx 4080 super day every day nvidia doesnt meaningful competition dlss path forward especially new dlss 4 transformer model thats even better previous model already nvidia isnt ray tracing getting topnotch gaming performance highend gpu youre purchasing fsr complete joke compared dlss dont nvidia hardware youre stuck applying mod hack try emulate premium functionality get running nvidia gpus dont hack get real thing there literally halfassed mod called dlss unlocker people dont nvidia hardware source nvidia geforce rtx 4070 ti super owner
rt becoming mandatory whether people like indiana jones doom dark age go card thats better rt future proofing also upscaling becoming mandatory poor optimisation id pick card actually capable upscaling make choice decided 4080 super using 7900 xtx couple week
7900xtx unless want weaker card less vram also pay
7900xtx better 3 basically rounding error raster rt different story literally cant adequately play specific setup otherwise 4080s upscaling 4k dlss quality free performance boost dlss performance varied image quality tradeoff lot performance fsr tradeoff quality bit performance performance straight bad top dlss present much bigger amount game upgraded latest version fsr rarer cant upgraded except 31 version rare even fsr standard comparable neither utility spread literally thing 7900xtx side vram price running 16gb 4080 except case like heavy vr modding arent aiming additional price 4080s exceedingly heavy plain better choice
say dont plan raytracing may choice look indian jones doom dark age additionally though trade blow regard pure rasterization 4080s dlss soon 4 offer substantial performance gain cant imagine getting 7900xtx point
4080s worth extra money much better gpu much better performance thanks actually great upscaling age waaaaaaay better 7900xtx cant hit 60 fps 4k without upscaling fsr absolute garbage 1440p oled incredible experience playing game path tracing 100 fps best possible image quality feature like rtx hdr stuff nobrainer
7900 xtx going return since nvidia snake actually meaningful update dlss didnt care much latest news price difference 200 used almost new strix super still think worth better resale value well due feature set good card nvidia offer thing like rtx hdr dlss better rt performance even dont need right think 13 year even dont want return 7900 xtx still think correct move
xtx way
amd great appreciate trying provide raw power extra vram amd fanboys trying convince people dlss bad amd people like well unless really care really amazing tech offer way better performance future gaming go amd dont care feature amd better
4080super friend mine 7900xtx raster performance often exactly similar ram exactly cpu 9800x3d friend way crash instability compared run raytracing way better cyberpunk run 150 fps everything ultrapathtracing 1440p resolution dlls balanced new dlss update look like previous dlss quality frame generation game come 14gb 16gb vram friend said going nvidia next gpu worth dealing amd driver problem crash worse upscalingframe gen
either way xtx faster without ai upscaling b game even beat 4090 cod play amd also fluid motion frame cant go wrong either gpu
there choice really
ah sorry forgot mention bought new 27 240hz 1440p oled monitor

future proofing id say xtx worse option game already started built ray tracing cant turned xtx fall apart rt imo 80super would age better 16gigs plenty enough dlss 4 mfg usable 40 series whereas fsr4 wont coming 7000series
good excited abt purchase let bffr lmao
take run wow dx11 mode
part nvidia software unusable lol
unless really care really great technology provides much better performance low cost thats constantly innovated basically mandatory new aaa game dont go nvidia dont care thing
unless want play vr 16 gb enough id definitely recommend 7900xtx day ago based price imo dlss4 well worth
there one game thats using 16gb 4k max setting indiana jones path tracing amd card cant even

indiana jones doom dark age ac shadow require something like amd rx 6600 play thats ray tracing gpu required mean play 4k indiana jones 7800 xt 60 fps arent going release game xtx struggle play anytime soon
isnt nvidia subreddit need shill hard
unfortunately seems come every form technology option pick android v apple xbox v playstation nvidia v amd make hard read comment people straight sound like paid shill people experience one mostly research point
wait saying objectively useful dlss ai upscaling b time putting outofengine framegen amd advantage
thats kind problem opinion seem divided dlss hear upscaling good isnt going problem right future may become useful framegen seems little gimmicky though
mainly cheap xtx getting hard decide worth eating lower playable rt eating rtx tax 300ish
7900 xtx perform similar 4070 ti rt really depends much rt title youre play rt title dont see reason buy amd card
similar monitor managed get xtx 670 crazy deal asus 90 rebate went 3080 happy crush everything 1440p upscaling needed sure continue newer game happy mine

sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon people asking advice nvidia simply offer superior product
lol used logic thats allowed reddit youre supposed push agenda
think b dont use either side first amd card happy leak saying like 1015 increase 5080 4080super xtx already 10 faster 4080s game gen upgrade nvidia unless youre gen behind suppose like said either card great cant go wrong
also depends want max raytracing run everything native max 4k rt every game 60fps im sure cyberpunk might bit 4 year old game beast card fine 1440p
yup heavy discount 7900xtx indeed change balance wont bad card sure 100 sure 4080s age much better rare upgrader matter much
7900xtx nowhere near 4070ti rt dont mislead people
ive card recently finally settled 4080 super normal raster trade blow rt even close 7900xtx behind 4070 super lot title cyberpunk 2077 example game feature set 4080 super put whole tier performance v 7900xtx also game play lot flight sim like fs2024 dc world hoping start using vr 4080 super also better think difference 100 less choice always 4080 super
lol let serious
much depends type rt load 7900xtx behind 4070s
gaming 4k 6900xt us often 12gb vram
thats bit hyperbole considering run majority steam library 7900 xt 4k 60
vram future proof gpu quite bit 3060 12 gb still great card today partially doesnt hit vram limit 8gb10gb people somewhat saying back 2021 whats point dont follow amd vram people still enjoying card 4 year later none bottlenecking contemporary vram safe guard future game xtx beast card still largely stock unlike 40805080 reasonable price considering performance
firstly everyone us gpu gaming example vram extremely important ai machine learning work although dont know would ever choose amd nvidia youre department regardless vram gaming performance
4k average 12 game would suggest using game favor amd certainly wont see 10 difference title
10 isnt true even 4k proper test sample
dx11 dx12
havent tried new nvidia app nothing wrong control panel one ancient design
ok 24gb total overkill fsr look shit 1440p dlss actually usable
43 difference 4090 5090
sorry want talk exclusively outdated ewaste ill visit ramd rradeon yeah im teen dont care company look product never understood tribalism tech nerd dont like sport need root someone satisfy primal need
think b dont use either side great thousand upon thousand user thinking b among enough actually use unlike xtx already 10 faster 4080s game one blatantly false since average xtx best 5 faster time even achieving let alone difference tied pure raster
time need upscaling youll need new card turn setting stay native prefer native ai garbage imo
thats true see nvidia gpus always struggle time go amd gpus take get better time
lmao amd card also use vram nvidia card well one 4080 super complaining vram
youll fine 16gb 24 overkill gaming fine 4080 super advantage youll actually notice like rt upscaling
dlss quality internal render 1440p problem solved
people glaze nvidia hyperbole match age
regardless game currently allocate use 16gb vram indiana jones pt 7900 xt xtx cant
well im talking new release httpsiimgurcomekyvjzzpng run quake 3 4k hundred fps 1060
tell really need know people actually feel card people would rather pay production card thats already replaced xtx hater xtx think good card dont think even debate card buy 4080s within 150200
op mentioned ray tracing op mentioned dlss op mentioned dlss frame generation op mentioned rasterization op mention machine learning op mention ai seems like contrarian solely sake contrarian op made mention machine learning clearly indicates interest gamingrelated terminology arguing machine learning workload gamingrelated thread point
xtx actually great middle ground ml gaming handle basically every game throw easily also nice threshold vram run 20gb model like r1 32b 32b model ml gap higher training side inference side want run model locally try different llm xtx handle easily nice inference ml card great gaming card much cheaper price competition really great choice dabble focus game
sure put everything highest doubt lowered anything
must 12 u ray tracing high
didnt use much would make game stutter open
sorry comment meant reinforce statement
35 took 43
dont care brand used intel since 286 386 486 pentium 3 4 couple celerons i5 2500k i7 8700 bought ryzen 7700 better offering compared intel amd much worse card simple
tribalism sport embarrassing tribalism tech dont kid cool something
play lot fps big use stuff type game 2 year old card still competing nvidia near top end say near 90 card waste double priceand ai strategy great lose 600 billion yesterday lmao
least disingenous already play current upcoming game 7 year old gpus nvidia cant generation amd 7 year old gpus nvidia better upscaler newest generation amd potentially better amd generation yet released positive argument amd longevity namely vram absolutely exhaustive plenty counterargument
hasnt true since rdna1 released 3080 still par better 6800xt 4 year later mention feature set still vastly superior
amd card still thing fine day obviously arent good dlss right gotten way better
agree extra vram argument pretty meh since team red green implement use differently im tired people making claim based running demanding new release ultra
id willing bet least half would run much better minimal setting change regardless still exaggeration say xt cant run game 60 fps natively 4k
said didnt intend use raytracing amd also version dlss reason never talked
""
interesting xtx work station driver timeouts out use ray tracing warcraft fix issue
yeah nvm checked 4080 super link 35 still bit people claiming recently thats bit surprised
think took 124 v 167 4090 5090 4080s used difference rather setting 4090 100 baseline comparing seen many make mistake
f1rstx 7m ago 7m ago dont care brand im sure actually believe
know dlss reduces latency talking lot something 0 idea
earth using upscaler go playing fps sure current gen highest end amd gpu much slower highest end nvidia gpu next gen somehow flex 7900xtx performance raster 4080s msrp thats
3080ti barely better 7800xt
search recent review 3080 site make nvidia look bad
fine good enough youre paying close grand gpu
oh yeah course people brainrot due tech review channel using maximum setting many think knock one setting notch mean card obsolete
anything 7900 xtx run natively 4k 4080 well there single title 4080 cant run setting 7900 xtx reverse isnt true
lol
fsr crap compared dlss new fsr 4 apparently restricted 9070 card
fsr total joke compared nvidia dlss seen badly destroys image quality literally hack mod nonnvidia user unlock dlss want badly lol get real thing instead using fake hack try get buy nvidia gpu
didnt issue say driver timeouts crashing exactly happening glitchingstuttering
low native fact
xtx 300 cheaper 4080s valid eventually time ai compete native yet
turn dlss fsr corresponding internal resolution setting 3080ti retains adequate image quality 7800xt turn mush turn rt aisde dont exactly see comparing two card different tier different generation amd one latest generation moment argument better aging
dude really doesnt look httpsyoutubertt60onpm44featureshared hub tested year half ago lol
mean raytracing isnt even game play isnt much hog performance yeah ill save money go amd 4080 currently cost far 7900xtx even comparison value performance wise dlss great id love simply cant afford nvidia premium rasterization far important stat handle fine compared nvidia counterpart
agreed unfortunately oc replied seems team green shill ill admit got baited
true still make statement xtx cant run game 60 fps natively 4k silly
troll shame suppose
crap mean perfectly serviceable good yeah crap job amd user case better implementation certain game dlssbut thats rare good dlss pretty consistently generation behind dlss capable better dont know think crap
lower latency dlss quality 120fps compared native 80 fps fps lower latency im talking framegen
literally arguing thing dont know anything peculiar
eventually time ai compete native yet actually used dlss upscaling even looked 4k even 1440p display side side
year half ago lol look recent review dude 3080 trash
lol imagine stanning massive corporation arent rip choice 7900 xtx 4080 super tested decided 4080 super liked rt bell whistle dlss great card
well context game would actually require 16gbs vram probably true although might exception obviously xtx wont issue running game 4k native less demandingolder title wont use extra vram xtx make entire vram advantage point moot
3060 6600xt worse 7900xtx get 60 fps lowering setting
pretty serviceable good enough youre paying close grand friend build pc let use xtx couple week decided 4080 super dlss quality almost indistinguishable native resolution essentially free performance fsr maybe one generation behind dlss 3 new dlss 4 made gap even larger dlss 4 actually available rtx card unlike fsr 4
doesnt look good native maybe dlss4 idk question 4080super 5080
also 1440p he gon na 80frames native either card unless dumpster fire optimized game
youre telling 120fps upscaled v 120fps native lower latency right
yea used 3070 quite bit upgraded decent blurring artifacting several game could low vram
logic 6800xt 3080 trash 6800xt us much power 3090 performs well 4070 least 3080 dlss better encoding edit add say workload dependent extra 6gb vram 6800xt great benefit rendering workload
thats
every rtx card support dlss4 pls informed misleading people talking nonsense
4080s dlss4 like 3080 like 2080
lower latency exactly latency
