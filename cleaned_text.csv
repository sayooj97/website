hi im hesitating getting rtx 5070 ti rtx 4070 ti super checking secondhand offer found msi rtx 4070 ti super gaming x slim 700 good price check transaction potential defect recommended testsbenchmarks run etc anything aware concerning specific model
hi looking advice upgrading ryzen 5 3600 quite sure worth go 78009800x3d something like 7700x would suffice would prefer go am5 futureproofing game 1440p planning upgrading hopefully gpu 5070ti sometime year thanks
currently 3080fe looking 5080 seems like everyone recommends sticking 4090 one problem 4090 uhhhscalper priced death would go 5080 msrp hunt decently priced 4090
im worried ive made stupid decision would appreciate either confirmation fine decision current machine gpu 6800 xt cpu 5600x ram 32gb ddr4 3200mhz mobo b450 tomahawk max since upgrading 6800 xt bought 4k monitor im currently getting framerates want 6800 xt fsr 31 implementation far ive wanting new pc ive splashed following pc ive decided go 5080 rather bring 6800 xt gpu 5080 cpu 9800x3d ram 64gb ddr5 6000mhz mobo b650 plus reasoning upgrading 5080 dlss seems like much better anything amd offer youre wanting higher framerates 4k even isnt huge raw power upgrade think dlss make capable 4k 6800 xt worry reading 50xx snark jump 6800xt 5080 really small think reasoning make sense
ive never power limited undervolted gpu 5090 im turned bit wattage warm may make room sound like people success limiting 4090s 7080
im building new pc week new component new build 4tb ssd question issue move current 1tb ssd new build worse spec new one quite bit take probably delete data old one fresh install factory resetting pc enough
buy new graphic card upgrade old one need smoothly transition two replacement included
bought king 95 pro case understanding come 6 fan 3 120mm rx fan bottom case pull air supposedly told buy 3 ax fan exhaust top radiator setup rx fan reverse blade pull air system rx ax need top radiator aio exhaust air matter im using montech fan rgb show 1 side
connect every pin listed pic connecting psu motherboard httpsimgurcomakvsvyjt
new aios cool cpu aio pump speed fan speed radiator
hey upgrading pc 4 year id like ask specific part compatible si anything look tip much appreciated current motherboard msi b450 tomahawk max would like get following cpu amd ryzen 7 5800x 38 ghz arctic freezer 34 esports duo cooler following gpu gigabyte windforce oc geforce rtx 4070 12 gb thanks
hi ryzen 5 3600 rx 5700 xt 16gb ram 500gb ssd 1tb hdd want upgrade play 1080p 6074hz idea play alan wake 2 indiana jones doom dark age would change
hi good tool tell im cpugpuram bound ive got 10600k 3080ti 32gb ram window 10 thing run fine older processor im wondering advantage might see start thinking upgrade v staying ive got used mostly photoediting gaming 4k game played baldurs gate 3 newest dc vr system taxing
might thread anyone suggestion headset preferably 150 max wont kill temporal region wear glass using current headset long period start hurt since applies enough pressure time
still cant decide 9800x3d 9900x game perhaps 510 hour per week almost nothing aaa monitor 1920x1200 intend play gta 6 though rip dvd via handbrake video encoding via lightworks without considering price two cpu
anyone suggestion motherboard upgrade old one z390 plus gaming motherboard support 9th gen cpu want motherboard support 1012th gen cpu im unsure motherboard pick thats quite similar one currently
chance 650w psu would enough 5090 need buy new psu undervolting currently ryzen 7 3700x 96 gb ddr4 ram 3 ssds 1 nvme 2 sata 1 hdd looking replace current 2070s im biggest gamer play stuff like bg3 witcher 3 plan ai stuff well
nope rtx 4090 radeon rx 7900 xtx also extremely fast gpus big memory buffer rtx 4090 barely 2530 slower 5090 consumes less watt generates less heat still second fastest gpu ever far total beast radeon card closer rtx 4080 come rasterization raytracing closer rtx 30903080 still plenty powerful much much cheaper gpus choice highestend
5400 rpm ok 7200rpm doesnt usually cost much id first check see anyone near tossing old hdd though
id rather get another ssd budget reason trying cheap cheap 1tb sata ssds available less 60 one example reputable brand httpswwwamazoncomteamgrouptforcevulcaninternalt253tz001t0c101dpb09wmp5b5n
really doesnt matter board second x16 slot going run x8 x4 pcie version 40 50 least double quadruple required bandwidth
doesnt exist seriously buy new nic compromise cut gpu 8 lane pcie v2 card could x4 almost every board would fine x8 option theoretically could motherboard 16x slot 8x slot 0 m2 slot connected cpu nobody make since chipset backed 4 pcie lane nobody make chipsetconnected x8 x16 slot im sure thats practical reason also technical there enough bandwidth connect x8 v2 pcie device x4 v4 link multiplexing x8 link x4 might difficult edit pcie device still work slower slot since card doesnt actually require x8 bandwidth might still perform 100 x4 slot maybe bit slower know am5 motherboards 24 pcie lane allocate 16 go gpu 4 go m2 slot motherboards 4 used 2nd m2 slot motherboards theyre used pcie x4 slot really care pcie x4 slot performance make sure get 2nd type
neither ideally really depends usecase machine first one decent gpu cpu simply isnt going cut lot situation saving grace am4 platform decent upgrade option extra cost thats possible doesnt ship ancient motherboard perhaps didnt receive proper bios update second one isnt much better 2070 nonsuper like 5 powerful rx 6600 cpu dead socket provides upgrade path 9700k certainly improvement 4500 already struggle game wanted better performance would back square one buying whole new rig neither reason go slow possibly shitty component pc might harboring power supply barely powerful enough run component room powerful gpu older possibly small form factor motherboards lacking socket additional storage drive expansion option slow ram hdds rather ssds crappy cpu cooler 9700k pull 25x much power 4500 option number 2 would least last couple year need replaced completely
sound like normal temp
cpu draw wide range power 45 250 watt cooler likewise wide range thermal rating efficiently dissipate heat cpu average power draw 140w triple fan aio cooler keep 70c regardless though summer closer 75 without information situation entirely subjective technically speaking 76c perfectly fine modern cpu thermal sensor prevent operating exceeding specified limit usually thats 95 100c range fancier chip like ryzen 3d cpu need run cooler limit 89c
anything 90 generally acceptable
1 since mobo im planning buy prev gen probably need update bios first right without compatible cpu may update probably yeah update without cpu case update needed 2 cooler come thermal paste need order one come paste 3 psu nzxt c850 gold 2021 old standard atx 30 whatever called need special cable motherboard mean gpu buy nvidia gpu come adapter amd gpus work without adapter
spare another 15 psu able get b tier model like kolink enclave seasonic g12 gc corsair rm650e there nothing wrong psu either c tier seasonic desktop lasted 7 year mentioned know
cpu come packaged cooler nothing amazing totally adequate ryzen 5500 dont need buy separate cooler
right im big fan logitech either decide good looking keyboard remember case full plastic correct im wrong shouldnt really case price point get great keyboard price point even board like nuphy halo 65hehttpsnuphycomcollectionshekeyboardsproductsnuphyhalo65hevariant41783229087853scaref2298388p6ze403kqn youre competitive game id say decide asking question want look youre fine blue switch everyone like wireless personally think really important keyboard since cable usually isnt way mouse
normal consumer cpu there zero difference running 50 v 80c stability lifespan technically effected relevant normal cpu arent run edge stability limit obsolete decade time effect lifespan become relevant like pushing world record overclocks need squeeze every last mhz chip designing satellite run missioncritical code decade yeah lower temp better anything else keep 100c youre good go pure performance standpoint cpu perform identically long clockspeed stay regardless age temperature
want game 1440p maybe 5700x3d already enough
5080 msrp
worry reading 50xx snark jump 6800xt 5080 really small even assume 5080 performs 4080 super itll still significant improvement 6800xt httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewgputestsystemupdatefor20252html
undervolting seems like move httpsyoutubelvlmrkiwyksi0ykmqlqtminmftnqt959
got 2 friend 4090 term temperature mild undervolt wonder also might get extra mileage card since temperature voltage add wear dont expect wonder managed undervolt 0120mv 9 5mhz oc helping heat one friend got significantly without sacrificing lot performance got luckier power limit almost certainly come performance loss undervolting doesnt necessarily
dont delete data put new pc
youre staying within gpu brand swap card make sure driver date youre switching amd nvidia vice versa boot safe mode runn ddu completely remove old driver swapping
want rgb face inside case top fan need normal fan normal pull air pretty side exhaust ugly side
second eps cable required i7 i9 cpu draw enough power stock setting warrant second cable
quality fan radiator size radiator fin surface area equal heat dissipation potential pump never worry assumed manufacturer spent good deal time figuring powerful needed effectively use attached radiator crazy good pump super fast fan still crappy cooler 120mm aios example get consistently performed cheap air cooler simply offer radiator space one fan blow air fan quality speed usually play noise level cooler effective dispersing heat
would work fine may need update motherboards bios get cpu working however httpswwwmsicommotherboardb450tomahawkmaxsupport gpu would work fine long power supply right output
cpu gpu least ram isnt really required cheap right ssd work fine game however alan wake indian jones massive game there telling big doom may need upgrade capacity fit one drive time would think indiana jones specifically extremely taxing cpu gpu native raypath traced lighting 5700x better would fine absolutely need leap power consumption per core help 5700x3d would best gaming cpu socket gpu generation amd started shipping card ray tracing core 6000 series isnt super great still multiple time better 5000 series improvement 7000 series nvidia also tensor core raypath tracing calculation rx 7600 rtx 4060 considered minimum upgrade afford something powerful go however getting new generation gpus starting next week wanted put gpu month three lot new option available soon
check utilization gaming like msi afterburner hwinfo64 check utilization individual core cpu cpu whole whatever max bottleneck
kaje right also simply gpu isnt 95100 utilized youre probably cpu bound
lower graphic setting see fps increase youre gpu bound dont youre cpu bound increase bit time upgrade
jayztwocents showed tool intel work gpus show stats help figure check video httpsyoutube9lbcmvzaxowt935 tool called intel presentmon bit newer software msi afterburner bit easier use
youre ok 35 jack use philip x2hr headphone combined vmoda boom pro x2hr velour pad theyre easy temple even glass x2hr jack cup boom pro replaces normal wire one boom mic inline good sound quality there volume wheel mute switch wire end boom pro single trss connector come adapter want plug audio mic different slot x2hr good sound quality great music well game sound profile lean warm bass exaggerated x2hr 140 boom pro 20 roughly budget also use boom pro headphone long 35 jack cup another connector easily adapted audiomic like 25 example philip shp9500 80 vmodas lp2 135 ive never tried cant vouch comfort think sennheiser model jack question please ask

video encoding would lean heavily gpu cpu 7800x3d 7900x 7950x dont need absolute best gaming cpu market look slightly older option may cheaper
way man card draw almost 600w nvidia recommended spec 1000w spend 2k gpu must get good psu
thank reply ive read intel x540 negotiate x4 x4 enough full duplex 10gbe one connection would running network card chipset add real latency cant seem find motherboard x4 slot going straight cpu edit clarify cant find one x4 slot cpu doesnt make top x16 bifurcate
thats im thinking also thinking chance getting one gon na price great lol
ty eli5
connect safe wont cause harm right
im asking dose making fan spin faster pump pump faster cool cpu
thx response thinking mid year upgrade least gpu 5700x3d wont overkill 1080 one sight gpu thinking least buy 6700xt im budget think alot costbennefit ram low price right maybe better save money gpu nvme p psu 750w xpg core reactor a320 mother lol
consider biggest fan shoving stuff clean ear deal wax residue appreciate standard 35 connector might give another go thing improved lot budget area
nope cpu draw power requires
extent normally pump separate fan cooler separate cable motherboards separate cpu fan cpu pump header cable increasing rpm pump unlikely cool cpu effectively already spin fast need running maximum rpm time likely wear quicker increasing rpm fan cool radiator faster certain point reach maximum heat dispersion based radiator size rpm effect
faster pump work quicker water flow system take heat component however due rapid flow speed water temperature get bit warmer since spends less time radiator fan cool radiator higher fan speed pushing cooler air rad cooling system depending scenario effective one biggest factor cooling though remains radiator size reality wont matter much unless run massive heat problem would indicate insufficient radiator space reference run pump fixed rpm ramp fan needed never issue
5700x3d put around performance ryzen 7700 although better frame stability 1080p cpu matter due load gpu lighter simply best option gaming slot socket without upgrading motherboard

didnt expect much 5090 uplift due staying node still bit underwhelming mostly kind expected least bigger rt uplift due tech architectural improvement itll still completely unavailable due dire shortage massive 32gb vram buffer though looking forward productivity benchmark im guessing itll rather similar saw one blender benchmark slightly impressive game benchmark suggest

httpswwwtomshardwarecompccomponentsgpusnvidiageforcertx4080superreview make slashing base msrp 1199 rtx 4080 999 4080 super msrp manufacturer suggested retail pricing made number nvidia
seems pretty much inline difference core count two card
dude 4k good test card even best cpu difference increase 8k
upvotes
came someone watching closely title made think 5080 content see
day launch otherwise correct
yeah looking hardware spec hard see 10 performance increase 4080 5080 5090 got 2030 performance increase 2030 relevant spec 4000x 5000x card tsmc process
thought changed 29 jan review 5080 release date 30
mean 4090 embargo lifted timing see 4090 released october 12th 2022 major review came 11th dont think embargo timing alone significance instance
5070ti fe mean msrp fiction would better getting 5080 fe attempting buy launch
4080ti baby need clock clock comparison 4090 5090 noncpu bound game 4k way extrapolate ipc uplift 5080 4080
5090 also intriguing think really get pay thing id ever buy
better 4080 thats guaranteed much air im assuming 25 better rt whatnot
everything hearing 5080 around 58 faster 4080s big deal
agreed 4080 vram saturated 4k msfs 2024 medium textureswhich leaf 5090 improve performance simulator 2k happening even modest improvement 1820gb would enough get edge edit maybe theyll unlaunch like original 4080 12gb
yeah quite easy cap 16gb vram modern title dont feel like im futureproofing much im getting enough vram run game already even gow ragnarok eat 1314gb 1440p almost insulting leaked workstation card 96gb gddr7 meaning could put vram gaming card choose
tbf nvidia intentionally using way low vram expected better bring even expensive version later vram instead using enough first time
loving fact amd gave 20gb enthusiast level card think 7900xt going fine long damn know way game dev day
coming 3080 10 gb thats 60 increase memory feel worthy upgrade sure wish cheaper im going buy one right away mostly dont money ill probably get 5080 eventually possibly wait ti super version come
deleted
yeah 5080 20 gb id line day 1 buying assuming review arent horrible 16 gb im probably waiting next gen upgrade 3070 ti here hoping 5080 super year give u vram price point doubt though
reason obvious ai model even vram hungry game thats primary target demographic people running large model need card parallel performance add much ram purpose apple tier kneecap
would nvidia prioritize vram outside titai mean x090 series card main push right whizbangwahoo bullshit ai solution oh want run game native resolution oledqled gaming monitor fuck pay otherwise youll like upscaled content ai generated frame increased latency thats least feel like nvidia telling consumer lack seriously deep pocket shell x090 series card
wait super 18gb
game requiring 16 gb gddr7 vram absurd people complain game zero effort put optimization demand gpus enough vram studio never bother optimizing vram hack code run like shit
5070 5070 ti dont launch till late february may
card coming time february set release date yet id expect info 50905080 launched
way 5070 worse 4070s
seems 5000 generation really smoke mirror 5070 4090 frame generation reality wont even fast 4070 super hope wrong thing look good entire 5000 series
every major player graphic space saying year hitting end raster sympathize prefer artifact raster rendering artifact neural rendering worried long time ago
terrifying worried graphic card plenty thing terrified worried 2025
yeah techpowerup comparison pcie 4 5 couple fps
look like liquid suprim continue ride another generation
yup im waiting 6090
got mine right christmas launch year
getting 4090 msrp felt like win year
got mine used last year 14k big w
smart move shouldve gotten 4080 gotten three time better bang buck 10 percent less performance
bought mine september last year dont feel bad even though wasnt much cheaper 5090
everyone whining scalper jesus get waiting list patient think took 3 month launch get 4090 paid msrp
plus testis
yes
go without saying amount vram 5090 insane vrs gon na shoot roof
unlikely 5090 get 30 30 increase die size power usage 5080 spec suggest like 35 faster linear scaling hold
comment read like non tech aware company using tech word sound smart
tech yes city review undervolts 5090 350 watt help fan noise heat especially itx build dual slot card still impressive thats compromise beast lot power considering would want pair top end cpu also failure using 850w psu
call good bump
5090s heatsink literally demolishes noise level throughflow design there turbulence pressure inside card stupid 30 series single fan fe likewise 40 series ridiculous wish nvidia stuck dual fan design run wicked quiet
appreciate thought someone also 9800x3d3080ti machine seriously looking card 4k120
think hotspot shown aussie guy channel
im big fan nvidia doubt going blow lossless scaling water even 2x scaling l jampacked artifact quite noticeable effect latency nvidias 2x scaling still thing far less experience 4x difference even pronounced said consider 4x functionally useless lossless scaling would surprised much useful dlss already hate 2x aid whole lot work make 4x viable option
mean expected fairly similar 4070 ti super card without major improvement except mfg groundbreaking obviously 40gen really good problem
according videocardzhttpsvideocardzcomnewznvidiageforcertx5090reviewsgolivejanuary24rtx5080onjanuary30 schedule january 23rd geforce rtx 5090 msrp card review january 24th geforce rtx 50905090d nonmsrp card review january 29th geforce rtx 5080 msrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5080 nonmsrp review january 30th geforce rtx 5090 rtx 5090d rtx 5080 sale seems 5080 review going bit disappointing usually 80series match beat previous gen flagship rasterization performance 5080 probably wont match 4090 title
believe come like day release last heard something like
yet find think staggering review
good exhaust aio itll fine
he also really positive dude hating nvidia whole way
yes
4090 already 3d got nearly twice speed rendering octane 3090 5090 isnt much faster still around 30 importantly 32gb
yes afford absolutely 20 thousand cuda core probably hard even utilize fully
recently watching cpu video really liked performance per dollar metric reason dont gpus
deleted
well yeah itd less dangerous use stable nonoxidised cpu
nobody using 14th gen i9 15th gen blow water 285k consumes way less power faster xd
removed
depends budget id rather look used 4090 4080
afford want 1080p monitor high refresh rate yes sure im planning upgrading 3080 one even get hand
afford absolutely itll upgrade lifetime let upgrade another 10 year probably xd
need
price go 100200 medicore 5090 see trash 5080vs 4090
afford cant afford worth saving plus 3080 ti awesome
im reading considerable upgrade 3040 4090 5090 raw 4k performance without ai gimmick considerable 4k gaming need ai need imo happen hit circle 3090 right even extra vram im struggling 4k
going get 4090 one see 5090 msrp lol
depends price 4090 somehow cheaper yeahbut msrp get 5090 point
8 central time 30th
ebay price go
dlss isnt crap fg hand
review price ebay
4080 regular super perfect 1440 240hz monitor ill wait 5080 tisuper time even maybe 6080
embargo january 29th fe review
x90 gpu usually worst term cost performance ratio within series likely find 5080 5070ti fitting target review remain seen may find brand new 4080s 4090 insane price right cuz theyve discontinued month ago
tomorrow think
29th
hotter literally higher power card anyway packed 4090 cooler would run way hotter new thruflow cooler way efficient 4090s stupid single fan one
solid advice put flux magnetometer associated power stage
dlss doesnt cause input lag though reduces ive never felt input lag even 3060 ti dlss
thats graph nvidia gamersnexus go trash disingenuous
comparison chart without dlss
link nvidias graph gns
32gb insanely low vram huh
1080 ti 11 gb vram would know im still using
bg3 crazy cpu intensive
likely due cpu limitation lower fps bigger uplift cyberpunk 4k native pt showed pretty huge uplift
almost like cyberpunk part nvidia marketing
daniel owen explained video fps low usually rounded given 3265 v 2043 rather 33 v 20 lower fps percentage difference rounding example 36 v 14 different percentage 4 v 1
fake frame though
bg3 poorly optimized vulkan 11 spec implementation nothing fancy
mass flow rate biggest factor cooling remember server card fanless theyre sufficiently cooled 50ish mm 10k rpm fan forcing air rack
bit weird wording thing suppose 5090 33 thinner 4090 like sale 33 item thats 300 3 slot youd expect 200 2 slot 150 flip focus 5090 could say 4090 50 larger depends youre comparing
improvement size regression temp noise ill take lower temp noise
yeah like see big chunky boy case
logically 50 cheaper right obviously used less material make new card
dlss using ai massive boost ai speed help shave frametime cost especially transformer model upscaler
laugh 3kw waterchiller
thats pure rasterization performance upscaling boost significantly higher since dlss 4 multiframe generation exclusively 5000series feature
exactly still around 30 overall performance increase especially 4k ultra 25 price still nvidia literally quadruple number multiframegen framegen seems advanced enough literal x2 x3 based many frame want generate
wendel pointed turn dlss power draw drop considerably turn framegen drop 4090 level entire blackwell generation come good framegen technology
efficiency term look techpowerups review term power efficiency top5 card use multiframegen powerlimit card beat previous gen limited lower fps literally efficient 4090 want
nah make gpu alone use 1500w case space second psu might well give reason use lol
amd objectively worse efficiency gpus nvidia intel amd hell
modest jump huge jump price power consumption 30 performance 25 jump price guess 30 modest 25 huge desperately want hate nvidia dont give anything real hate
finance video card 24 month youre living beyond mean clarifying point taking advantage 24 month financing 0 percent isnt bad justifying purchase spread 24 month bad
best buy 0 financing 24 month throw card go home happy oh remind curse
also obviously dump heat systemhttpswwwcomputerbasedeartikelgrafikkartennvidiageforcertx5090test91081seite12
also pulling significantly wattage 5090 normalized cwatt remarkable improvement
4090 definitely hot lot people run pretty cool given power httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewasusgeforcertx4090matrixplatinum35html
mean want card dont want pay scalper price wait line microcenter get waitlists may take month get one oh well like obsolete anytime soon dont pay msrp
yeah biggest uk retailer expecting single digit stock 5090 im expecting worse scalping 3000 series covid
kinda fun try hunt xx90 msrp usually take month hate scalper doable without much difficulty able 3090 4090 hoping 5090
use python script snag one msrp way order one scalper thats scalper buy stock
voodoo1 voodoo2 voodoo3 tnt1 tnt2 day 300400 started charging 600800 high end titan card world went insane
yeah ive building pc decade told would never spend 1000 video card bought 3080 600 cad year ago even bit painful cant bring spend much single component
flagship card used sli crossfire setup hd 7990 gtx 690 dual gpu card 999 1112 year ago really wasnt even top end solution top end quad 2x 7990 gtx 690 2k gaming slicrossfire killed began make dense also creating slightly larger dy chip shoving waaayyyy power
thing xx90 isnt flagship never flagship equivalent titan used xx80 5080 basically price 1080 ti adjusted inflation obviously
still incorrect
yeah know list 4080 super 1199 launch date also wrong
aint scary thought looking 50805070ti5070 number compared last gen option
8k also good test cu almost noone us 8k display
using 4k ray tracing gaming
mean guess awful since share price point previous gen unless youre rolling older card there zero point upgrading look like
5080 probably 20 better 4080 super know hitting 1tbs memory bandwidth remove lot bottleneck higher resolution 40804080 super would get left behind beyond 1080p 4070ti even bigger offender roughly 8 raw technical advantage cuda core count freq also remember 5090 33 increase cuda core average 33 faster 5090 5 slower boost clock could mean ipc least 5 better 5090 might scale 100 many core could boost cuda advantage right around 15 add less memory bottlenecking could hitting 20
might scale quite bit better 4090 60 die size advantage 4080 wasnt 60 faster 5090 proportionally core performance show scaling better close core count 5080 4080 end bigger difference performance thats hoping least
guaranteed purpose im willing hedge bet realized product halted manufacturing 4080 super early anyone want 80 series card need go 5080 cant really find 4080 super left plenty 4070ti super
im buying fall msrp 4070ti super dont see different
1525 normal modern generation jump real world workload guess
bet 510 better pure rasterisation 2530 rat tracing dlss scenario
4090
im similar boat 3080ti 16 gb doesnt feel like enough jump 12 gb justify g
bet well get another super refresh card newer 3gb memory module get true next gen card would mean every card get vram bump 5060 super 12 gb 5070 super 18 gb 5070 ti super 5080 super 24 gb think would enough vram win people
thought one found 16 gb enough play escape tarkov 4k reach 15 gb vram 4070 ti super barely leaving anything ob streaming understand tarkov one worst optimized game world moment though haha looking forward 5080 highly disappointed hear 16 gb hear leaf room 5080 tisuper 24 gb likely
use dlss youre shooting foot devs shooting unoptimized game waste vram
7900xtx
3080 10gb 12gb long think would 16gb 5080 crazy 10gb 3080 want jump 5080 compared 4080 super big deal 18gb 20gb feel like would better value think aib card might increase spec clock
im expecting 5080 ti gen vram hoping decent improvement 5080 mega lacking
list price workstation 96gb outrageous thats serious 3d cad multi station workflow shit right
yep thats issue spent 699 qd oled 360hz 2k monitor want future proof rig started grad school want kid soon new gpu year wife pregnant aint chief forget seriously considering going 5090 afford serious future proofing get thr 5090 say fuck get 5080 game 2k using 9800x3d
deleted
3080 moved 4080 one gen although 4080 got trashed online still 6gb vram improvement gave access frame gen huge flight simulator gen 5080 feel like zero upgrade extra vramill sitting think 3080 owner 5080 great upgrade cheaper 4080 launch fast 16gb vram dlss4 improved rt processing better thermal etc
coming 3070 itll double faster speed im definitely getting 5080 maybe ti come ill consider upgrading thats least year though ti
coming 6800xt two generation older 5080 exactly 16gb im getting new card two generation newer doesnt improve vram current card
thats exactly nvidia intended giving okayish vram one premium product youre really inclined upgrade rather sooner later well played nvidia well played
sure could also pay 5000 5080 15 gb memory would feel worthy upgrade 50 increase memory point nvidia purposefully keeping vram low people pay higher end card need also making buy separate exorbitantly priced card ai really holding people back near monopoly gpus cuda imagine world people buy 24 gb gpu 300 buck nvidia would still make enough profit poorer people could game also tinker ai 1000 16 gb vram awful ratio comparison amd 7800xt 16gb vram cost 500 buckshalf price
4090 priced
suspicion see 3gb module way move 8x2 6x3 giving u 18gb total using fewer module
wan na wrong man
wont even fast 4070 super doesnt seem likely
nah bro sell 4090 500 get 5070 nvidia telling truth sure
well every major player nvidia neither amd intel publicly made claim could partially due position market advertise improvement youre concerned raster rt similar gain comparatively specifically supposed next step rendering technology nvidia getting complacent tech go allin ai rendering im even concerned nerual rendering frame generation still ghosting artifacting problem alongside input latency penalty still good enough supplant traditional rendering method imo
yes context luxury hobby hardware worrying rest planet right
perfect thanks head going going 5080 5090 impacted look like ill safe
150000 usd barely used apparently belonged ex seller bought gift set put back market trying recoup cost felt lucky considered new one around 2200 time
bought one used 1450 sold last month 1550 got another one used 3 month 1300 last week
vendor typically waitlist havent bought new card quite year rtx 2070 gang let go wouldnt mind getting waitlist definitely hurry plan pay msrp
waitlist pay msrp
dude keep saying example he given arent waitlists theyre email stock notification doesnt cut edit clarification bh look like pny msi card listed going preorder given time date launch morning basically maybe specifically he talking whatever reason aib partner dont message presumably target one aib card preorder info listed get early would get chance buy later relaxed schedule
waited month walked best buy got ez decent card anyways
extra benefit waiting time youll able see new radeons caught amd match nvidia rt include lot ram might switch

scaling isnt linear across generation better 35 much
anyone slightly informed beyond surface level understood everything wrote
part work 3d animation render gpus hence relevant u none term used particularly obscure happy help something isnt clear
mean knew going yikes saw 575w tdp didnt think itd actually hit 500w consistently though im surprised people dont take issue
yes amazing one like 3090 4090 good
3080ti used l mfg scaling look good goal match display target frame rate eliminate tearing stuttering
dont worry still 5070 give u 4090 performance
wait mean nonfe msrp card
lifting 5080 embargo day release certainly decision
referring metric experimental chart segment cpu review didnt watch whole video expect already cutting lot thing try keep length video really refer 40minute video way sort analysis seems likely relevant card way competing price
didnt watch im buying card lol letting anyone interested know
actually straight gave bullshit answer front first 15 second saving lot time looking itching hear appreciated im gon na let video play way get view count
totally agree spend 30 per year gaming hardware software combined spend 10k per year car difference majority community agrees price worth especially high end game context suck
much lightly used 4090 aftermarket card sold time
3080 ti awesome struggle modern ue5 title 4k unfortunately 5090 surely cost closer 3k eventually maybe 1000 euro 4090 might smarter move
yah realizing price 4090s lmao guess answer
sure youre looking amazon scalper rhardwareswap 4090s sell 1400 seems consensus buy 4090 save cash 5090 though im opting 5090 price difference seems worth since trend 90 series hold value well upgrading gen gen doesnt cost much grand scheme thing
cause 5090 disappointing
dumb
said new design seem provide fair bit thermal transfer 4090 fe cooler significantly smaller run little bit hotter cooling card us 130 much energy concern well hold time since introduces many new point failure memory module seem roasting squeezed tiny board next massive vrm
surface rack make sure compression auxiliary working 3 opposed box setting 14 also reset manufacturer boost recommended dimension whatever clock rate compared censor core temp
sorry clarify there upscaling thats fine input lag confusing marketing part dlss3 includes frame generation introduces input lag due fake frame correct im wrong
woops youre correct realized never included chart showed difference im going delete comment useless
scrubbed video unfortunately doesnt look like one
pretty sure jayztwocentz one without dlss
yeah mb point still stand
flip side relatively light gpu still pushing good frame even native 4khttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertx5090foundersedition10html
even 4090 cant hit 60fps act 3
think fps always get net increase fps unit 10 fps 20 100 increase game would still unplayable honestly wouldnt go upgrade even gave 100 increase 140 280 fps dont play interest game would factor yeah get value

use fake frame lock base frame pay 2000 card hmmmm would stay 3000 series use loseless scaling need cap thing u add fake frame 4rd party software maybe add 8 per frame convince u bigger better v
mean fact come locked annoying already benchmark dropping nearly 100 watt cut performance 6 overall would make look worse 4090 keep power category annoying trend across industry
cope supposed new gen price jump gon na massive aibs looking 2300
one could argue financial perspective dont take advantage 0 financing option something going purchase anyway youre fucking
exactly pay something 24 month interest free meaning youre spending additional money period smarter moneywise drop 2000 catch 0 financing offer bank fact buyer forgetslip paying purchase full end buyer get charged full 2year interest purchase thats recommended make sure fully paid typically month 2 period end make sure
read time value money live well within mean never turn 0 financing offer significant amount money
purchase justification user use case current hardware etc way saying buy 0 financing nice convenience get 0 financing literally anything
adding comment financing anything doesnt increase value generally bad recipe problem including video card people want obviously id recommend take monthly payment would save every month ive seen people financing thing luxury item get hit unexpected car repair cause miss payment take year catch interest payment one exception cash hand luxury item offered zero interest financing spend someone elses money keep money something earns ultimately come ahead people arent reddit trying justify gpu purchase
free loan guy finance dont really feel like dropping 2k right 2k 24 month interest however
youre spending per month make financing legit build credit thing let convince bank sell house
afford card financing financing 24 month 0 interest zero downside
use card responsibly course

offer waitlists time upgrade im new buying thing impossible get msrp

ive looked video showing performance gain versus insane power draw increase 90 imma wist till 6000s definite
fuck source basically non existent launch true even bot left disappointed
got tip best ive always bought second hand
month sound like lot difficulty
remember looking getting two zotec gtx980s sli going around 1200cdn tax inflation still would around 1500 never pull trigger purchase couldnt fully justify time 5080 going easily 1700 tax 5090 probably easily going well 3000 paid 1150 3080 covid
even 580s sli era 500 2 2010 voodoo tnt pre 2000 iirc sub 300 card dropped lower tier card much cheaper tv tuner version expensive always wanted one lol
voodoo tnt old memory smell sunscreen magic card

dunno edited showing correctly
interestingly enough number core 4070 ti super 5070 ti slightly increased 8448 8960 actually decreased 4070 super 5070 7168 6144 thats probably nvidias graph reference nonsuper model release going shitshow next month
make real happy 970 4080 super purchase
yeah overkill clearly gaming alone gigagenius
overkill care make unreal game make sure make unoptimized possible play see card reach limit there need atleast
im interesting buying top card muck around ai image video generation wouldnt touch new 5080 lame amount memory ai generator like lot memory ideally card would 64gb video generation think nvidia allow card maker put much memory card want thats possible idk
yep 4080 probably least tempted ive ever upgrade gpu bit better nothing exciting im interested gpu upgrade doesnt yield least 5075 actual raster performance increase 970 1080ti 4080 50series aint
honest looking new card might well pick 5080 instead 4080 super like going get big discount 4080 super
super different due supply oems reusing board instead new design buying fall mean would able find msrp nice cause msrp make best value lineup
reasonable see dlss 4 pretty good improvement im side using ai achieve better performance good long doesnt compromise everything else much
keeping 4090 production selling 1499 would undermined nvidias 5000 series
thought itmaybe could get fire sale someone upgrading wont paying premium new one due scarcity love idea used one
3090 feel ridiculous upgrading 5080 would make lose 8 gb vram
thats feel im gon na going 1080ti think im gon na bite bullet get 5090 want pc last 67 year without upgrade hopefully
likely 10000 range
youre releasing gpu double ram equivalent card 9 year ago youre something wrong gta6 easily eat much memory
aaaand cant nice thing sometimes wish pc crowd resolve budweiser boycotting moron
ive got 3090 feel like really awkward spot 5080 would upgrade everything except id actually lose 8 gb vram feel bad 5090 feel like true upgrade
exactly individual user situation many upgrading 5080 worth others redditors like act like card complete scam people buying sucker fall nvidias marketing theyre even asking people card theyre upgrading use card personally im 5050 split gaming ai added ai power extremely valuable extra gaming performance nice bonus
ok dude like amd card better buy amd literally one stopping personally choose buy nvidia feature want yes cost little im ok dont understand upset
buy save
4090 performance wait 25 year
itll 1500 fe meaning 2000 third party card
would lower bandwidth though would make 5080 even worse

restocked holding card x amount time dont purchase within window lose place line want retailer wipe as whine semantics

much dont get nvidias problem people cant cool computer evidently house
lol people see bad review 5080 say well atleast still get 5070 4090 performance nvidia marketing battle
rate 6070 give u 7090 performance
correct least launch
idea u norway get 4090 around 1700 4080 around 1000 comparison 5090 retail around 2480
feeler gaming trio got lot bite 1900 cad 1320 usd went 2100 mark got nothing got mine launch though
dlss dude solve issue mention save 3000 buck scalping price xd anything go 4080 90 80 within 10 percent performance 90 caveat less vram though 16 gb still twice much use dont issue far one third price 4090 plus melting power connector 90
absolutely bonkers anyone managed get one around msrp made like bandit point
shall see
frame generation add 5 millisecond youre waiting one frame time actually put extra frame fake frame really frame smoothing work really well despite artifact optimum video youtube think best one actual review he generally positive 5090 seems anyway frame smoothing one youre running 40 frame second otherwise itll look funny
aso many people even monitor capable 280 fps dont would 4 fps upgrade
whats mfg
implication fe 5090 high mass flow rate air allows server sized fin array
main issue ive always seen gpus constraint commercial customer cooler limited size id argue typical tower pc build cooler size doesnt really matter much day given likely small subset gamers pcie card except gpu ive long wondered could somebody take advantage design serverstyle consumer gpu pcie slot 20mm apart 34 slot card two 60mm fan back card perpendicular pcb blowing air heatsink would work natural airflow path tower case direct airflow outside case possible run passively highairflow case
look
deprecate isnt exactly right word correct say something like dlss 4 feature limited restricted 4000 3000 series card
back ported deprecated deprecated different
im pretty sure pretty confusing dont quote new transformer model exclusive blackwell even though algorithmic enhancement dlss4 cnnbased model least thats sounded like digital foundry reporting literally review guide coming card thats good least
lol dlss4 multiframe srie 50
yes straightforward implementation basically previous card act generating frame requires dedicated flow accelerator hardware reduced base frame rate since take gpu resource processing separate hardware get frame double performance also fact framegen work well frame rate low begin reduce frame rate gpu throttled need run frame gen frame rate work well framegen great time changed process use lightweight ai model run inside cuda tensor core instead separate hardware result lighter gpu result literal 2x 4x quite funny seeing 600 fps cyberpunk 2077 sure youll need wait probably digital foundry game breakdown whether something want enable seems impressed least well need see whether ai model also result similar performance boost lowertier card kinda impressive
stay 3000 series thats needed hear yes enjoy 3000 series card
certainly dumb trend never understand argument trend still tweak card easily lower power consumption click problem largely solved like card stay way box
supposed new gen yup 30 gen v gen pretty normal price jump gon na massive aibs comparing 4090 fe 5090 aibs thats stupid thing going 25 jump looking like like card youre getting better performance per dollar deal 4090 uplift pretty standard new gen got ta get hate
depends credit card often kind financing give cashback wouldve gotten paid full
updated comment clarify agree 0 percent financing great tool op acting like decision maker least interpration youre still paying 2000 dollar video card affordable split 24 payment doesnt justify purchase unless going anyways
easier budget good cashflow let kid people using use buy afford later take 3 end entire monthly budget eaten mortgaged product ive used ease sting high ticket item im talking 24 week always pay immediately sometimes feel bad see large quantity leave bank account also could help keep credit card utilization certain threshold
also give 5 cash back reward dollar spend best buy opting 0 financing thats something consider
wouldnt either justifying purchase saying spread 24 month mean living beyond mean
time value mean something actually something else productive money cash spend either way financing doesnt much arent investing cash elsewhere dont cash first place financing living beyond mean
ah okay make sense
racking balance credit card improve credit card open length time build credit credit card installment loan would different story

youre right certainly use lot power typically people dont say something run hot mean high wattage run high temperature 4090 actually run cooler many lower wattage card still produce heat card high wattage better transferring energy environment

lol got fe 4080s around price week back
game 4090 barely getting 60 fps native 4k example cp2077
lol overkill 4090 cant even max display need card actually push
almost seems like know 24gb 5080ti coming bet sits price point 4090 doesnt make sense massive vram gap
problem 5080 looking 200 4080 super canada
want good advertised sold 23 frame manufactured looking good hope wrong
ill sell mine
going want 5090 cant afford
update 4090
1080ti youre going get lot benefit thing beyond vram dont think thats applestoapples
3070 5080 stupid doesnt matter get 8gb vram enough idea many people sub let nvidia get away
5070 super likely 5070ti doesnt right die also likely would disappear super series released would mean less cutdown dy end design
cuda core count isnt everything 5070 year newer part latest generation card unlikely 50 cheaper mean run considerably worse there less year difference 4070 4070 super theyre generation yet latter 15 faster im saying cant happen going improvement say 15 would pretty unique situation

certain overall thickness may make sense pushpull fan opposed thicker fin stack gamersnexus look prototype card earlier month take 5090 passthrough idea extreme less pcb way way thicker ultimately doesnt seem viable nvidia make since theyre trying make card intended pushed much beyond reference spec
transformer model usable rtx card afaik digital foundry talked expect heavier current model everything 50series hardware intended run transformer model quickly
always spend people money
eh yes cant afford drop 2k one purchase today could pay wouldnt prudent certainly wouldnt dip saving stream 84 dollar month 2 year yeah fall next monthly cigarette purchase course work single couple splurge purchase free 2 year loan well
one thing reminded got bestbuy credit card 4080s purchase came 10 reward first purchase within 24hr used new card obviously went check gave 5 back option financing option ended returning 4080s later didnt matter always bugged never got 10 cashback option soured bestbuy
read inflation money almost certainly going worth today even used unproductively 23 month
paying balance improves credit credit card nothing need show pay debt
midlate ampere thing lovelace went right back early ampere add cartout stock
bestbuy doesnt offer waitlist notify come stock nothing pleasant email come already botted
great give time save money evga wait list 3090 worked well enough
discord channel good
feel less bad launch 4080 still bad less bad
people sold 4090s gon na upset 5090s selling 3k 5080 thing available guess enjoy downgrade
didnt read answer ig live bubble
want folk like ughjr67jurbgrt buy low end rtx pro formerly quadro card gaming card
nothing ever good advertised unfortunately
honestly im sure yet 5090 really damn expensive assuming everything weve heard correct got 3090 craigslist 500 whole rig 1500 hard justify dropping gpu 3090 still pretty well game wouldnt mind trying hold 5080 super hopefully 24 gb vram could also see looking pick used 4090 someone upgrading think 3090 sell decent price since vram future proof better old card
eh considered get one good price maybe im sure jump enough worth 4090 available made build got 3090 hold 5000 series feel weird go back 4090
yeah itll big jump shame really still run alot new game 4k look like new game like ff7 rebirth indiana jones making obsolete due required rt guess inevitable unfortunately
dont upgrade wait next gen 5000 super series whatever shouldnt feel forced upgrade new card released youre disappointed current nvidia card simply dont buy dont shame people choose buy
comparing 5070 4070 course faster talking 4070 super nvidia purposely didnt compare guess find soon enough 5090 benchmark really show nearly improvement gen gen ipc happens 5080 believe reason think 5070 significantly improved
youre concerned fg used confuse consumer thats fair enough guess dont necessarily buy nvidia set embargo way 50seriesspecific reason since embargo date seem pretty normal nvidia nvidia doesnt really deserve benefit doubt im worried nearly every reviewer review thing perspective doesnt match average gamer according nvidia people use dlss given opportunity good thing review overwhelmingly done without dlss nvidia set ab test frame generation trade show prerendered native 240fps v fg 240fps rep flabbergasted professional reviewer able immediately tell one frame generation really expect expierence friendsfamily similar reviewer think review need become lot complicated subjective ready
cant speak bb actually going use 40 series bh literally send confirmation email option get signed biweekly update say still list whatevs eventually get email saying restocked like 24 hour something actually buy card lose spot oem manufacturer well dont post notify link actual launch got 2040 series card evga asus bh still dont believe dont know tell
wow didnt realize 3080 ti could actually bogged mean 3060 ti struggle minecraft 4k shaders without shaders could run 8k still nail 60 fps probably already impressed xd might build machine 3080 ti point cuz like 30 series overall except 3050 nobody like 3050 good doesnt deserve anything hate get 4080 super good alternative youre looking upgrade one gen go 50 series
got got alienware 3225qf ive got 4k 240hz looking build new system 5090 might alley currently 5 year old rig 2080 super
wasnt talking pushpull setup rather fan blow air across card lengthwise rather card youd need fairly thick card make work 2slot card would limit tiny 40mm fan 3 4 slot many card already could use 6080mm fan move lot air much lower speed would aided natural fronttoback airflow many tower case already
true 2000 financed inflation negligible 5 inflation 24 month thats 200 buying 2k gpu 200 doesnt mean much
im sure youre getting information true high balance paying improve credit score return base line tanked score high utilization revolving credit installment credit racking balance paying different paying full month there literally whole metric score based called credit age
ahh thats pity scalper win

said hed need make new game explicit purpose maxing card received reply existing somewhat old game easily max card equate answer read
nah look like didnt read comment
yeah butwhat nerd wan na ai relevant career need learn spare time love gaming
curious much would sell 3090
one shaming anyone calm tit bud couldnt give less fuck issue guy excusing 16gb fine thats ridiculous
comparing 5070 4070 super significantly improved could slight improvement

commenting reddit insufferable experience whole point original person responded acting like reason anyone would finance card couldnt afford lump sum payment absolutely case easily afford would rather finance could stick 2k stock market pay bill etc would likely yield positive return versus spending entirety money front since edited post clearly wrong none hard understand
fuck yes ill take 200 10 discount obviously 10 discount value money changing throughout life loan youre saying complete nonsense
theyre selling regardless theyve little fuck give theyre selling anything likely bitter scalper get make extra margin

youve looking ebay right checking price maybe facebook marketplace well well tell lot people trying right sell 4080 4080 super msrp bought theyre getting stuck sitting market youre smart buyer youll wait 50 series drop someone asks pay exact amount paid card theyve using month tell go f 5080 faster know much faster keep mind seller jockeying get hand likely limited supply 50 series card according rumor meanwhile huge supply 4080s 4080 super decent amount market pressure people sell 4080s one 50 series come want sell fast want money towards 50 series card would patient set roof price dont buy price whatever decide
think 5080 v 4080s sidegrade actual upgrade sure faster much one know exactly 29th 7800 faster dont think there also dlss40 going 5080 opinion divided
depends fomo ive read 5080 1015 better performance wise 4080 super sure resolution youre playing 1440p 4080 super enough also get support latest dlss updated id go route put saved something else setup
5080 wont 50 faster 4080s thats pretty much safe say need card 4080s decent buy 1000 usd probably wont miss much v 5080 would get price earliest summer
want best value 5070ti likely perform better 4080s cheaper card rockstar value
think 4080s going ok product even 5080 come dont love either card msrp okay value 1k local equivalent would wait buy used 4070 ti 4080s someone overeager jump 50 series 4080s 900 seems quite good
would go ahead get rtx 4080 super really cant go wrong beast start enjoying immediately
make sense headache last week ive made choice buy refurbished 4080s 15 discount new one barely available way overpriced anyway since obvious 5080 wont cheaper difficult catch wont huge generational gap wait next gen absolutely 0 regret pretty sure wont next two year
4080 super wait game 40 series card still relevant still perform youre waiting 50 series youd consider pricing also whether get hand one scalper around
im currently running 3070 waiting 5070ti come canada may even upgrade anyways depending price trade war brewing right paid part new rig moving fron ryzen 7 3700x ryzen 7 7800x3d move 3070 know much answer

im boat portugal leak look like 5080 1800 bought 4080super 1200 5080 come actually cheaper 14 day return 4080 question asked get 5080 small increase performance doesnt justify enormous difference price get 4090 5080 price
word im hearing based leaked performance data 5080 modest improvement 4080 super know little longer wait one compelling new generation 5070 ti cut back little 5080 34 price vram see though
leaked benchmark rgadgets probably place 5080 looking hot right 4090 example performs food thought
50 price worth 5 performance mfg thats need ask
4080 super enough year come save money
5080 isnt worth price bump imo 4080s plenty card year come
get 4080 super 4070ti super built architecture 4080 debating waiting 5080 coming 3060 12g got fair deal canada 1050 cad 730 usd brand new large retail store would get 4080 enjoy platform likely less driver issue forseeable future there always caveat brand new card
get 4080 super price point go get losing value 5080 fact expected performance 5 4090 losing performance value due much cheaper 4080 super
4080 super
5080 benchmark already leaked everywhere 8 increase 4080 even 4080s think choice fairly clear
dont really need lastest gen card
got 4080 super finding 5080 gon na msrp europe afterall couldnt happier get 4080 super
pulled trigger 4080s exact reason seeing 5090 benchmark since performance improvement 5090 4090 still pretty meh doubt 5080 would worth wait especially considering hardware upgrade much smaller itd 10 raster improvement access 4x multi frame gen anecdotally resulted artefact initial testing least 25 cost assuming msrp fe aussie never get least 3050 aib card like initial assumption sure could improve frame gen ai time might well see 6000 series go next generation tech becomes mature
pricing similar live 2300 aud haggling buy used 4090 look beating 5080 country mile saying
im currently boat gut tell go 4080s fomo tell wait see benchmark cost availability honest doubt 5080 much efficient 4080s justify additional wait cost
plan play unreal game use nvidia dev architecture id waiting 5080
youre going spend much 4090 seems like better buy id definitely 4080s long meet need 5080 isnt enough faster ive seen justify premium unless really care 4x frame gen
like fake frame wait 5080 buy 4080s enjoy life less money
get 7900 xtx overclock since high performance one around price 5080 msrp
second need get stock dwindle way 5080 gon na price range 4090 super launch performance difference doesnt really justify cost upgrade moment
agreed 5080 bad value compared 4080 super guess thats happens generational increase poor
fantastic advice exactly id
making assumption people sell 40 series card purchase 50 series card happen given limited supply 50series card inevitably high price msrp wouldnt surprised see people hold onto 40 series card mention part reason gpu price always comparatively higher australia u exceeding ppp exchange rate australia great consumer protection law would prefer buy new take advantage
dlss 4 intangible impossible consider 40 series receiving upscaling benefit thats plus
1440p 240hz expecting push far aaa title 4080 super still competitive game
4080s enough 4k even
considered 5070ti 17001800aud compared 1600aud get 4080s today also dont think im prepared wait long im sitting onboard graphic staring first 1440p ultrawide oled
1600aud almost exactly 1000usd almost unheard comparable price gpus australia im thinking good deal
think mention buy 4080super keep sealed return 5080 benchmark come back unexpected
bought 1440p 240hz monitor hope last long long time
australia lot
comment really swaying toward 4080s im sure 5080 going 1020 powerful large increase cost particularly australia there always next generation upgrade easier spending less money
mean theyll stick run 4080s right 15 worse pending upcoming benchmark
4090 australia 35004000 unknown reason significant amount 1600 4080s 25 increased performance 1440p
get great framedollar card bad value compared 4080 super price likely bit faster feature
5080 bad value compared 4080 super come seems around price value sad new generation still worse
reason buy electronics new germany much easier anything go wrong first couple year 4080s game 1440p 240hz 4k 120hz panel pretty much perfect card use case consider priceperformance certainly really change 60 series release give much bigger performance bump similar money hopefully
dlss 4 released 4080s itll also get tier multi framegen thingy think get x2 version 5 series get x4 x8 dont quote ive played cyberpunk 2077 4080s new dlss net 20 fps everything maxed framegen 110120 fps
get mfg buck form lossless scaling need spend hundred dollar
id get 4080 super
yeah think answer id go 4080 super
dlss yes even demanding aaaaa game youll lucky hitting 60fps consistently
think 5080 end 1015 faster 4080s based core count 5090 performance software feature seems get 4080s mfg definitely drawback said dont think msrp great value 4080s unlike buying one early 2024 dont think value card hand week worth lot skeptical 5080 offer much step term priceperformance getting one could quite challenge think buying 4080s decent price defensible
lucky yeah get unless really want multi frame generation justify cost increase 5080 faster real jump better machine learning model used dlss coming rtx card dont care compare 7900xtx similar performance 4080 super worse ray tracing dlss though fsr gotten better
price today clearly per ops provided pricing pricing even worse would pay 50 money less half performance gain thats frame dollar 4080s win today easily simple math
op say price 50 buy 5080 v 4080s need base current pricing 4080s released given poor reception 4080 launch overpriced
agree price difference worth lossless scaling look feel nowhere near good dlss frame gen
customer protection make msrp easy choice country protect customer
well today isnt available buy sure wouldnt pay 50 4080s 5080
cant comment dlss fg feel seeing cant use 30 series pleb say use lsfg almost every single game play good recent update improved performance quality dramatically already pretty good course mentioning get downvoted sub
even release stock level dont sound great better 5090 stock great market different im saying price 5080 isnt great deal wish got usa pricing side globe
i9 14900k undervolted barely pulling 220watts peak gaming would lucky hit 125 watt fine
dont think ever cpu gpu time peak like least gaming undervolt able shave 200w peak number combined maybe even make sure stable
wont ever sit peak usage 14700k pull 400 watt
dont get 14700k please get 7800x3d 9800x3d instead
14700k4090 hyte y70 rgb etc issue 1000w psu take look draw peak see headroom
enough
youtube channel called hardware buster released video yesterday say people latest intel amd cpu get 1200 psu minimum make sure everything work correctly pc doesnt shut watch video make mind think position would
wont peak power cpu gpu time also one best psu market
ideally want keep psu usage 80 maximum efficiency would suggest 1200 watt psu safe especially ever plan overclocking cpu atx 31 pcie 51 would nice 5090 power draw spike could cause psu go overcurrent mode shut probably wont hurt keep happening 5090 crazy expensive 5080 would likely plenty 4k usage especially gaming productivity work psu would enough
youre way fine firstly even direct die custom loop cooling youd barely able cool 400watt cpu gpu blowing 600w heat forget second limit recommanded 253w doubling consumption 10 increase performance rendering worth even close 253 gaming either way
think nvidia hoping everyone would little nuclear fission reactor home time launched 50 series
owned intel cpu point id power limitingundervolting maintain acceptable performance minimizing silicon degradation time worst case 14700k drawing 400w peak could avoided though smart configuration setting bios allowing avoid buying new psu go 5090
get 1300w gold never worry rocking psu close decade never worried power
need 1200w run safely 1000w enough fan drive oc transient power spike
depends rest build fresh build id go 1200 high quality already 1000w good quality id probably roll mainly going 1200 stay better noise efficiency window noise bad get shut downsissues always replace later
wild comment saying need upgrade 1200w 1000w fine real world usage going pull 1000w even good quality psu supply rated least short period time
put build pcpartpicker get total tdp build good rule thumb plan 12x tdp available power supply cover potential spike keep system stable example let say tdp 900w 900w x 12 1080w rounding need 1200w power supply
probably need 1200w needed 1000w 3090 7820x without overclocking would randomly shut game 850w wasnt cutting anymore titanium rated seasonics
get 1200 always want call
yes 1200
1200w
never maximum peak power time even case psu still safety reserve itll run inefficiently 100 capacity sustained itll shut get hot much current going limit power limit 13700k max 250w call day wont feel difference performance
technically could get away undervolting either cpu gpu realistically wont yeah new psu cool idea thats really practical seen pc 1 psu maybe could get 6700w psu dedicated card rest build
computer would need 1000w psu beyond
im pissed got 1000w new build dumb thought would enough fml
fine software generated power figure accurate corsair power supply top line series ax something show actual power drawn power supply much lower think current cpu gpu situation dont need 1kw power supply matter combo needed sli era dual cpu board extreme platform maybe use 100 mechanical hdds attached
ran number psu calculator build pull close 900 watt fully loaded drop 9800x3d take immediately 120 watt load drop 7900xtx 630 watt
dont buy intel 13th14th gen ewaste bro point true way maximum power rig amd

spending 2k gpu choking save 200 1200w psu worth
sound like already still work great cpu still

honestly sub tunnel vision polar thing ive 14700k havent issue great card post comment ignorance plausible deniability come hasnt happened yet happening havent noticed blah blah end world guy buy intel card theyre still good every single one crumbles ironically metric obsessed people melting compulsively running benchmark

playing 4k ultra 5090 hit 761w draw test game 4k ultra assuming anyone play see peak 700w leaving 200w rest system 1000w
buy watt meter check consumption gaming jump new expensive psu reason
odd using 600w gpu 220 cpu sametime pretty much never happen
yes hwinfo processor tab cpu package power
wont choke anything unless plan oc furnace intel cpu 500w gpu
fantastic cpu 14900kf 14700kf 14900 1 year old month nothing wrong low voltage awesome performance 14700 6 month old thing awesome
ah yes

nothing performance
yes 7800x3d ia beast

efficiency also dont want running psu close max time system need wiggle room good rule thumb always buy power supply cover 20 system tdp
still least good rule thumb powerful enough psu system imo think 1000 watt enough 5090
patch fix damage already done time
referencing eps pcie power cpu gpu
hopefully battery backup report proper wattage usage
tech powerup review cpu show 200w gaming depends possible especially game need cpu power next year
there nothing wrong something wrong
yes already work well
gaming
got 13900k used 200 lol going amd point completely cost prohibitive
would buy am5 board aswell already intel board z790 prime use 1213 14th gen 120 new got also 9800x3d 550 i7 14700k 330
dont dispute dispute date claim make material difference efficiency hasnt case good quality psus long time
dont problem suggesting right level psu outdated notion efficiency material factor hasnt case really long time yet keep getting thrown around like still relevant
yes 1000w psu enough 5090
yeah thats warranty
even happens wont still 20 extra wattage availablezero reason upgrade psu point
correct lol good way look
anything history object get well noted issue resolved honestly way sub forgets 7th gen chip fried mobos launch incredible resolved code everyone forgave amd board maker overvolting chip enough cause fire yes let go constantly still intel gradual degradation performance bricking

yeah dont accessory fan drive rgb also dont transient power spike sure maxed 850w 10900k3090 accessory would rather spend 200 better psu already spending 2k gpu one reason 4090 custom loop system went ax1600i psu power never issue

nvidia discontinued production high end 40 series card month ago anticipation 50 series launch
rtx4000 rx7000 series gpus process discontinued stopping production manufacturer dont worry clearancing old stock later
drying supply 40 series still relatively level demand since 50 series isnt fully yet short supply
also built using 4nm architecture mean would likely produce less new card wanted keep fabs pumping 40 series card wont able sell much
manufacturing scale back current generation card scale next generation card production fewer card expensive next generation card drop scalped theyll expensive cycle gpus
people kept thinking price would go 40 series telling people thats work stopped production make hard get drive demand make 50 series hard get scalper make worse
person said wait 50 series release wrong unless scalper apparently
time upgrade bad 10 year
ive asking ever since release 2000 series
amd competing nvidias biggest competition youre likely buy 5000 series geforce cant find sanely priced cheaper 4000 skus
usa tariff threat
get rx 7800 xt instead
yup looking rx6700xt one sell anymore instead going 7700series 7800 good choice
situation 4070 super cart month reasonable price doubled lol suspect 5070s get thing normalize fully expect pay msrp though
probably picked perhaps worst time buy 40 series card nividea launched 50 series discontinued production 40 series card price gon na go
pretty easy get 4070s 50 series announced got one niece build 2 month ago bestbuy sale albeit 20 hehe
timing upgrading graphic card bad yeah amd model also drying great time said still jumped 4070 super couple week ago pretty nice 4k
nvidia always discontinues previous generation launch new generation around 2 3 month launch might make exception one product stack generally entire line
ive seeing radeon way 7900xtx pretty readily available around msrp reason people arent pivoting amd im guessing theyre waiting 50 series wondering anything else know 7900xtx isnt quite tier still look like really good card actually get one right
trump declared tariff people company respond expect get worse company selling even higher price future
nvidia card dont really go price much age stock dry small discount go away
timing upgrading graphic card bad missed hundred post comment warning past month
profit
cause there gon na another shortage black friday january sale
gpu price place right manufacturer scaling back production 40 series make way 50 series add scalper hype new card even fear potential tariffsits perfect storm supply low demand still strong people holding snatching whats left honestly bad time upgrade unless absolutely need
lot reason people buying inventory case u tariff impact early review 5000 nvidia series point incremental improvement revolutionary 4000 series card compare favourably priceperformance 4000 series card production inventory drying 5000 series arent yet available amd card offer pure raster performance vram niche appeal offer different value proposition short 5090 sell ai implication ensure demand professionalhobbyist space best available 5080 sell since theyre latest nvidia product 4000 series sell theyre proven still decent value money amd card sell theyre targeted specific price point fill availability gap
supply demand nvidia shifted production 50series stopped making 40series supply 40series go lot rumor 50series bad nvidia inflating price one point people utterly convinced 5080 going sell 1500 people started panic buying 40series gpus also lot rumor 5080 terrible based single leaked benchmark like 5 better 4080 making worse 4080 super good chunk internet seems biting onto rumor combine fear shortage panic buying get worse 40series price drop take good amount time typically prior gen price tend slip around 1 year thing stabilized also start slow usually need work used market want good deal prior gen 2 gen date price start seeing significant drop example 3080 550 outside used market problem time price drop usually still arent smart buy 550 buy 5070
op supply demand 4070s becoming scarce available better alternative cost go worst time get brandnew card 3060 day may see sale last gen 40007000 series gpus still shelf bestbuy store continue hold new card consider used market lot people selling able fund purchase new card might able scoop good deal preowned card
hmm able get two 4070ti super two week ago
amd ramping radeon 7000 manufacturing prepare radeon 9000 launch well
also ramp demand new people pause purchase waiting new card
arent yet drop 30th review embargo dropped day ago card wont sale another week
ugh realize 50 arent yet right
know dont buy even though amd isnt competing sadly many complain amd screwed competing fault
yea forehead tariff implemented causing decline month
shh need card dropping price
similarly performing rx 6800 xt even less
price best time buy back october xfx cranking even second hand card high belief supplier hoarding wait tariff sell higher even though already imported mean time still get tariff price without tariff dont want sell
basicallythe buy save damn
pretty sure nvidia discontinued 40 series 508090 30th 50705070ti time february 5060 hasnt even announced
fully meant arent sold yet there enough information performance price demand high leak supply fewer 20 series launch drive demand even higher
price already since ce board partner since limited supply initial release scalping followed tariff unless made usa price 50 get closer msrp 40 series incentive come either
amd fault cant buy cheaper nvidia card would hilarious take people didnt actually believe
gaming correct need one work purpose well get fucked
tariff threatsinduced pretariff demandhigher cpu gpu price people bought computer component trump took office
oo
indeed also good option
similarly performing 40w extra power consumption 7800 xt 260w
going suck horribly forgot stupid trump tariff damn already difficult dominican republic trying import usa get expensive never desktop gaming pc thats sure
last week bought last one rtx 4090 hour later corsair package 50 lol im almost 70 dont time build one first puter 1980 shook head told sent back guess didnt new puter god willing monday new puter way vengeance i7500 gaming pc intel core i914900kf geforce rtx 4090 192gb ddr5 6tb 2tb4tb nvme ssd win11 pro think using gtx 1550 got 6 year
people already told nvidia theyll buy expensive card 5090 people continue buy
work need look cost benefit buying bring much
sound like bro need use forehead
true also 100e cheaper month ago
ulowcoffee4427 cool config btw reason didnt opt ryzen

complicated spend little time research pick component youll eventually able slap build together minute also kind pay attention ton tech news stay date whats latest greatest whats best value within category want cheat code check logical increment get pretty solid build various price point
easy pick right part good pc however difficult comparing price current deal future priceperformance expectation etc month people debate wait next gen gpus buy old one edit possible great example fuck money enough cash could pick decent expensive prebuilt system happy course could save buck built chose another ram etc minimal performance cost gain say fuck happy new pc

biggest problem come people picking flashy looking component really low quality sound like youre
high end pc expensive im sure could afford rebuild whole machine original good part cheap part every id upgrade something im pretty close top end system rebuilt many time time need compromise cost dont tend compromise mb use lower cpu upgrade later cpu memory building computer isnt end goal continuous project

hard people like argue thing give small marginal difference likely never notice people
always someone internet opinion something upgrade either brand preference cost saving minor performance benefit etc confusing part inexperienced builder sorting brandsmodelsversionstech eg rtx 4080 super coming bunch version per aio brand oc superoc etc variant think budget seems want high end overpaying think going something like rtx 5080 founder gigabytemsi ryzen 9800x3d gigabytemsiasrock x870 isnt overpriced eg aorus elite 32gb ddr5 6000mhz corsairtridentzkingston samsung 990 pro nvme ssd whatever size need corsair rmx 1000w antec flux pro case airflow focused case like noctua nf 14x25 bequiet silent wing 4 pro arctic p14 fan arctic liquid freezer iii 360 cooler noctua nhd15 g2 think thats highend cheaping anywhere also crazy overspending super controversial pick yes optimal option different preference end gon na run similarly
get amd processor get whatever 7000 series amd gpu 4000 series nvidia gpu budget get 32 gig ddr5 6000mts ram name recognize 750 watt psu gold better name brand psu supplier enjoy pc dont worry people opinion
510k stupid assembling best functional component everything 35k max stuff stuff aesthetic marginal performance gain even overkill dont monitor level graphic realistically 12k build without spending stupidly fan case limited extreme gamer edition version thing etc another 5002k panel probably high someone need go without blowing money fun
honestly thing think complicated motherboards purely many seems like two identical find later one explodes doesnt
dont waste 5000 pc pc part get outdated fast would get best bang buck pc ready upgrade future needed
honestly vr 5000 dollar budget enough maybe much spending 10000 pc useless spend 5000 like 10000 pc ur gon na play 4k really high refresh rate 1440p
yeah last built one 10 year ago research everything build current one tech sometimes phase example like sli move hdd ssd m2 nvme real hardest part deciphering ridiculous naming convention like amd cpu range good luck trying get head around 5800xt compared 5800x like am4 released am5 newer basically couple percent uplift performance ti super etc nvidia manufacturer difference exist identical card
one hand wan na jump amd go 9800x3d hand im making anywhere near fuck money another year considering current pc 12400 4070 worth two half month salary made worse im basically upgrade dead end
ya bought 7800x3d like 300 slam dunk cant miss best buy probably fucked werent paying attention used cpu time hype consumer positivity 7800x3d carried 9800x3d good luck finding one msrp nevermind catching one sale rofl im definitely market upgrade cpu topoftheline am5 whenever make sense current ecosystem machine im running right doesnt make sense probably wont year two
pick one review say silent fan 3070ti gainward phoenix shit frikin loud high load anoying even headset never buying gainward
quality performance
rather ignorant actually ram failure rate usually low sweet spot speed timing generation solid state drive dram absolutely cause issue especially operating system game drive type memory also make big difference experience dramless qlc drive sometimes bordering unusable larger game example give bought crucial p3 dedicated game drive expand storage caused stuttering larger game stuttering gone drive replaced also drive internals switched worse performance original review power supply every power supply equal better conditioning power better worse protection feature current protection voltage protection there tier list take bit understanding help people dont need tier power supply tend check whatever psu im looking make sure doesnt fatal flaw purchasing however psu tier listhttpscultistsnetwork140psutierlist
gpu price make 4080 super
excellent advice decide part read bad review someone familiar thus creating hesitation doubt even best part bad review
psu list provided best stick atx 30 correct rmx better tier rme good great write btw helped ton
even thats drive psvr2 first place wouldnt use 5k resolution headset bad lol
dont need 5000 play 4k youd trying spend much
u go zttbuildscom dor like build template help stuff like picking gpu
least super ti card usually faster normal counterpart explain friend mine none talk 4080 4080s available lol
yes dont get dont go simple numerical order
went 7600x 20 7500f wait good enough depending long 7900xt sufficient could hopefully upgrade best am5cpu am6 already dont get new mainboard etc
good luck finding one msrp nevermind catching one sale understand may micro center near get big drop every 2 week dont fly shelf quick 475
bought 7800x3d im definitely market ask pc
fair enough specific quality cpu cooler gpu may important consider yeah noise always one ill generally get 3fan card know move air surface area slower rpm
rather ignorant actually yes thats point save lot time headache building pc popular wellreviewed part pcpartpicker checking compatibility nonenthusiast consumer okay know little nuance unlikely affect enduser experience meaningful way component actually causing big issue significant number people online review fall behind competitor
4080s slightly worse 8gb less vram 150 expensive
probably smart go atx30 since nvidia seems pretty commited way there bigger chance able reuse psu future build youre strict budget know youre going amd gpu want budget dont go atx3 unit really good psus rm750e good enough probably 90 build yes rmx slightly higher quality
sure 140000000 people game mobile chip 2014
4k gaming pc cost 450 lol jank work 60fps assetto corsa competizione easy
agree u dont need spend much
even nvidia laptop gpus v desktop gpus
micro center near nope local store sell msrp always back order said im really dying upgrade 7800x3d 9800x3d full price
yup microcenter ftw walked yesterday grabbed 9800x3d
guess point trying make always like upgrading pc would always like best make sense right kind bad time youre looking good value highend part far usage go mostly game also lot photogrammetry 3d modeling video editing drone got highend work pc custom built kind workload stuff sometimes home
yeah thats definitely kinda misleading realistically expect mobile chip restricted amount cooling wont able perform good desktop counterpart whats really absurd tho 4090 laptop around 4070s desktop term performance truly feel like kind scam lol
unfortunate gl hunting one ar msrp next best bet set alert best buy youre tech savvy use changedetectioniohttpsgithubcomdgtlmoonchangedetectionio ir notify instantly come stock
high priority right sure really broadcasted earlier reply id far interested something like 11950x3d assuming thats still am5 wait year well id rather catch sale rather pay full price
look much 4070s 14700kf cost amazon come back u lol
yep seems fine win giveaway seems weird
thats pretty good money probably low end board since wifi 5
lol
bidfta auction
yeah thats one thing noticed understanding expensive upgrade board would like one 25gb ethernet connection
yeah 800 fine
show photo socket processor
need photo one
imagine zero research putting high end pc together best gaming cpu world
assume amd processor may buy new processor
pin removed mobo
deleted
mb processor
lpt watch one video people building pc learn slight variation tip person better explaining thing others
yes
rip bozo
pc snuff prn schadenfreude
research lead instruction b c mentioning case wrong
research installation video cool still learning go
yep watching installation video didnt mention cover pop locking cpu mine didnt pop looked manual
pin cpu broke motherboard cpu slot
gigabyte x870 elite amd 9800x3d got phone computer store said cpu doesnt pin pin motherboard might still luck
processor remove pin tweezer motherboard
accident happen
good luck rest build feeling finish everything thing purring better anything youve incredibly satisfying
9800x3d doesnt pin pad youre probably fine
youre making sense word youre using dont correspond am5 socket cpu work post puctures
thats exactly thinking pin cpu mb pin get bent treated kindly chance perfectly fine could look mb pin strong magnifying glassmicroscopemacro lense phone check damage linus tech tip video showing possible relate bent mb pin
ya amd cpu pin 9800x3d would difficult pull every pin like mentioned like would need heat torch pry screwdriver hard
pin broke cpu need new one way knowing th motherboard damaged try
thank currently stuck needing radiator screw push pull method aio came enough screw fan came jt yes cant wait see finished project plus almost 4yr old daughter helping make memory
learned store customer service continue build
fact thought every single pin perfectly ripped cpu bring great joy next 24 hour thank kind sir

gave heart attack hopefully made customer service laugh
certainly made laugh count anything second read pin 99 sure cpu mobo pin board cpu edit confirmed
dude mean anything honest mistake make havent put together pc dont sweat
306000 2000 10 nanosecond 326400 2000 10 nanosecond exactly latency 6400 bandwidth 6400 might work 11 mode cpu

speed inconsiquential honestly latency likey get system instability 6400 kit 6000 kit id go 6000 save potential headache
get 6000mhz even gamers nexus us 6000mhz memory 9800x3d stable best performance am5
think people tell get 6000 cl30 work almost always manually push higher freq 6400 cl32 practically
6400 32 200 6000 30 200 think perform identically certainly within margin error
httpsyoutubebwfetqjifcsiuevmtyimdnvstlrg gaming 6400mhz cl32 performs slightly better thats system run 11 depends lot motherboard could require tinkering bios said difference miniscule likely something ever able identify without monitoring software
latency 6400 higher bandwidth would faster system allows reach full potential
recall formula ca latency time 2000 divided frequency case 10 nanosecond first word latency look kit pcpp 8700g unusual choice
6000mhz would enough
httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc6p92kme1chttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvc6p92kme1c 6000mhzcast 30 sweat spot 6400 guarantee stable performance increase uclf stable 3200 mhz force 12
get one better die 4800 ram running 8000 fast ram doesnt expensive
ryzen 7 8700g b650 motherboard id go 6000mhz cl30 ram here ryzen cpu tend perform better lower latency 6000mhz often considered sweet spot ddr5 am5 platform term stability performance
get 6400 way fasterr

6000 mhz cl32 1067 n 6400 mhz cl34 1063 n difference latency extremely small 004 n making almost identical realworld scenario however 6400 mhz cl34 slightly faster term latency additionally higher frequency may provide better bandwidth could beneficial memoryintensive application
generally speaking 6400 mt ram faster 6000 mt however task wont able notice difference also certain system run 6400 mt cl32 stable want learn ram speed latency recommend watching videohttpsyoutube9a4cagbyec8 topic would pick 6400 one anyway price already designed run faster needed select lower speed manually
ram speed 5600 6000 waste referring base mt mb cpu support 8400mts xmp base 5600mts since qvl tested mean guaranteed stable purchased listed
could explain youre dividing mhz cl im new pc component lol never really deep dived ram
push infinity fabric hit 6400mts gear 1 guaranty amd memory controller stability might involve juicing cpu tad voltage
apu imc better monolithic design
isnt 6400 cl32 guaranteed hynix mdie adie change
agree case reviewer test system always recommendation others set pc example gamers nexus use static 54 ghz overclock also 9800x3d 8700g different cpu architecture
claiming best performance 6400 mt cl32 would faster make sense
run 6000 mhz cl 30 stick 6400 stable software let clock 8000
perform identically made especially theyre usually price 6400 mhz kit room overclocking vice versa know depends kit die last question genuinely confused kit would even made
cl ram timing measured clock cycle ie number tick clock higher frequency mean clock tick faster cycle shorter dividing cycle frequency give absolute time ram timing delay issue command ram wait period data ready simplify thing waiting 32 164 n waiting 30 160 n
clock cycle tick per second latency clock cycle per access faster clock cycle mean complete access sooner
thats formula cl rating timing memory mhz speed two number together using formula give latency ram latency cl x 2000 frequency comparison 6000 mhz cl32 1067 n 6400 mhz cl34 1063 n latency 6400 mhz cl34 marginally faster bandwidth 6400 mhz cl34 also slight edge due higher frequency
sure know samsung hasnt idle last year make faster ddr5 hesitate commit certain right come cl speed im go bed could right
6000mhz ostensibly recommended every reviewer benchmarker across entire ryzen series even lower end cpu offer much better performance 5200 5600 almost identical performance 6400 despite costing significantly less 6400 am5 get unstable higher anyway general dont different architecture theyre platform exactly dont vastly different architecture different internal design placement overall design core architecture extremely similar
barely faster enough register hefty like 40 price increase world fastest gaming cpu performs fine 6000 fucking earth still pretending leg stand
faster bester
exactly latency perform task higher frequency processor initiate request time frame increasing overall bandwidth responsiveness though certain task favor latency may perform identically task favoring higher bandwidth high frequency ram better
mhz speed read write data 20 m delay read writes theory 6400 read write data per cycle faster real world heavily many factor basic explanation well
1 higher frequency faster memory timing often bottleneck higher clock speed mean data sent cpu memory controller running higher clock speed also decrease latency within cpu tiny bit bandwidth latency improved cl tell latency within dram one aspect 2 dram chip always clock higher waiting capacitor charge timing also logic circuit like microprocessor limitation 6400 cl32 kit always clock 6000 cl30 inverse isnt always true 3 ddr56000 specifically performance sweet spot ryzen 7000 9000 cpu quirk internal clock limitation uclk div1 mode infinity fabric etc ryzen cpu owner prefer buy ddr56000 cl30 4 everyone different risk tolerance overclocking ddr58000 cl40 faster bigger gamble
sorry used wrong cl number requested im going leave pist good example 6000mhz cl30 v 6400mhz cl 2 latency 1000ns
sure amount anything dr 2x32 patriot 6400 cl32 kit listed hynix adie qvls might different sr ram guess
hefty like 40 price increase price increase 3
one said anything fine discussing better simple concept admit youre wrong done claiming something best performance objectively extremely misleading
actually faster better case allows greater memory bandwidth maintaining exact latency really get basic fundamental understanding computer making asinine comment subreddit
bloody
nah cant admit fault especially 8700g might even handle 6400
case think problem rather didnt read shit replying
stop thinking youre smartest person room talking people assuming theyre ignorant unbecoming use case different best faster isnt better want rock solid reliability absolutely major factor platform relatively recently plus benchmark show unless ram dependent title like farcry etc really dont affect fps gaming much
thats lot word admit youre wrong talking stability kit 100 stable xmp motherboard cant run ram test one week straight get single error youre stable simple best one objectively better
performance benchmark better mean nothing real world performance indistinguishable latency important factor irl difference hundredth nanosecond isnt noticeable think objective full stop best room discussion bad faith discussion ill let keep thinking youre gatekeeper best ram
yes objective winner two choice listed op youre right room discussion
argument really dumb faster literally faster better every single way work objectively better every way
goddamn cant stand people like must exhausting living life way
7800x3d crazy price
9800x3d better 37 better like price 37 higher
amazon listing im thinking fake seller like yingping something fake address china double check seller
struggle trying build something keep long time havent new pc upgrade since 20142015
7800 obviously see 360
youre using 4090 id say go 9800x3d gpu id say 7800x3d 7800x3d bottleneck gpu besides 4090 unless game 1080p edit saw comment definitely 9800x3d lmao
definitely go 9800x3d
like 200 7600x
would say might depend gpu theyre gaming cpu im guessing productivity already secondary concern likely gpu bottlenecked anyway would save 130 get 7800x3d want room grow am5 without future cpu upgrade getting high end gpu already go 9800x3d conundrum building first serious pc went cheaper 7800 happy performance spec got black friday deal 4070 ti super waited 7800 price drop run cyberpunk 219 1440p ultra setting full rt quality dlss buttery smooth enough hope useful
350 7800x3d fantastic
cheap one amazon one review chinese seller dont waste time wont price match random third party seller
check amazon listing legit 350 good pas
u 4k take 7800x3d lower 9800x3d imho
9800x3d isnt worth 130
agreed thats best deal ive ever seen 7800x3d considering tiny bit slower 9800x3d id take deal every day week
exactly random 3rd party pop time time never review always chinese
sorry guy false alarm dumbass didnt notice wasnt sold amazon directly saw similar post yup scam seller price back 449 lol
wouldnt pay 120 cpu realistically better 1080p lower setting
180 microcenter
maybe totally worth
thought 20 slower
probably got cheaper got bundle cpu aorous b650 elite ax like 405 total cost door new year
37 cost 8 performance
depends game looking numerous benchmark average looking somewhere 13 17 faster 7800x3d 1080p number get lower 1440p 4k strain put gpu cpu unique exception like star citizen benefit greatly 9800x3d put high strain gpu cpu even higher setting
depending game came 20 need extra frame vr doesnt stutter sim racing worth like getting eight foot ladder sale need ten foot ladder sure cheap never going reach
path exile say sup
really make seem like 9800x3d isnt really worth
true across 40 game average come 8 9800x3d mostly improves 1 low could important 7800x3d also good well hard beat value 7800x3d
money play star citizen bg3 game perform much better 9800x3d im waiting hit good price pull trigger still pretty expensive canada live
doesnt matter cant give steady fps vr bargain doesnt job need
id surprised large difference two vr since push many pixel compared flat game difference already small really noticable 1080p
surprised physic based gamesim cpu pushed limit especially carsplanes view ive got 4090 driving pimax crystal im severely cpu limited
performance difference isnt terrible 1440p long paid fair price gre keep paid 7900xt price return httpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388htmlhttpswwwtomshardwarecomreviewsgpuhierarchy4388html
price good return inbuilt graphic enough normal pc task might regret delay much
asus one buy return gre thats 100 worth gre get asus xt thats model reach
f id definitely return get 7900xt similar price instead different brand arent huge deal come gpus long isnt noname brand dont recognize asus one fine
4060ti 8gb terrible card regardless price
8gb vram might cause issue future especially u wan na upgrade resolution 1080p fine ive heard pny time theyre budget option 280 cant really complain top head wouldnt know would give better performance similar price rn
7700xt better card price minus dlss imo least price outperforms 4060ti especially step 1440p
vram come question card strong enough really utilize dont think 4060ti ever majorly bottlenecked vram good deal even tough pny best brand price amazing deal
really tho name similarly priced new gpu outperforms objectively bad card bad nvidias msrp
highly unlikely therell lasting damage modern cpu lot built protection like fact running 06 ghz past yes would lasting damage cpu would attempted run full performance regardless temp reaching would seen smelled magic smoke also would turned afterwards sadly old enough lived literally turned system heat sink fully seated cpu
older cpu id worried modern one ton safeguard place stuff like
highly unlikely modern cpu even go far crashing o keep overheating
yeah youre fine heatsink able passively prevent flash heating slower heating trigger cpu heat failsafe
think fine man one kid reddit cleaned desktop meaning wiped everything turned asked running hot worry put thermal paste fine car kind idiot proof people still manage take mechanic silly reason
thats bad instruction arctic even video tell plug fan mobo
thats real bruh moment right
dont worry tried stuffing gpu slot without removing pin cover took way long realize wrong
hey least connected rgbs
yup modern cpu thermal throttle 0 needed remember day able cpu commit suicide turning heatsink
modern chip still delidded temp rise fast cpu fails shut time
happened first build 14 99 never forget first time fry cpu good time
thank reassurance found reddit thread 2 year ago op thing reply said thing similar told got really worried google ai said accidentally booted pc ryzen 7 9800x3d without cooler highly likely damaged cpu would rapidly overheated within second due lack cooling potentially causing permanent damage even brief boot without cooler detrimental processor
good know thanks ton feel lot better
oh man make feel bit better forgetting plug aio fan
yeah man proudest moment considering ive buildingupgrading pc last 10 year wont happen ever thats sure lol
yeah dont listen google ai like 50 time bother read providing inaccurate misleading information also missing nuance cooler installed fan aio pump werent running cooler still passively pull heat away cpu massively decreased efficiency better nothing though

buy non asus am5 board gpu buy xtx phantom gigabyte hellhound
dont buy amd anymore dlss 4 huge upgrade come clarity even beat game poor taa implementation u check rfucktaa
need one find good offer go wait 5070ti 5080
reading wrong spending 210 fan
would go nvidia honestly unless amd killer feature sleeve doubtful dlss4 amazing tested eye 4070s doubt would need anything 1440p next year

youre building pc need gpu get best one afford make happy move
sapphire nitro 7900 xtx probably overkill im going get build 2500 also would strongly recommend switching fan get arctic fan something want aio try liquid freezer 3 best aio get value match fan take suggestion also good looking imo
best time buy gpu last year next best time right price moving upwards
unbalanced build spend part actually matter gpu could cheaper cpu play 1440p4k definitely spend less ram fan
isnt dont get gpu rn asus brand anyone strapped cash buy dont give fuck product arent built better worse
use current gpu couple month cpu cooler got 9800x3d yesterday thermalright phantom spirit evo benchmarking cpuz hit 41c
shit got 7900gre mistake 689 stupid thought 7900xt im waiting probably return want play 1440p without issue year dont upgrade regularly want buy good

nothing wrong wanting look nice get fan ali express 7 also id recommend getting xfx merc 310 instead gigabit brand 7900xt

memory almost twice price get better priced one difference would almost carry xtx
wouldnt call balance 180 fan
oh alright balance 2500 budget would 4080 super minimum

hell hound design emulate whine noise actual hound hell
guess motherboard part meant sorry itx version good im curious there something aware
wouldnt buy 5080 7900xtx exists played multiplayer vr since wouldnt use dlss game whole stop buying amd 50 series annoying msrp there nothing wrong nvidia never work way
ur lost
play story game 1440p without ray tracing doesnt need 5090
work good asus board am5 riddled random issue
use dlss demanding vr title dlss4 look great judging clip flight sim httpsyoutubenst43ofb4smsik7q8ustxkct1aaww another example dlss absolute godsend modded skyrim vr probably heaviest vr experience date term multiplayer game wouldnt use dlss superior aa builtin performance boost work great marvel rival experience ultimately dlss massive strike amd amd aa fsr upscaling look like shit comparison believe amd better fps wise dlss4 performance mode equal visuals previous dlss quality mode advantage completely disappeared could change fsr4 thats far certain funnily enough area amd really keep right frame gen fsr3 frame gen pretty neat 3080

guess got lucky well really msi board first bought wouldnt boot bought asus lol
asus product riddled random issue
first time hearing anything positive dlss vr im open new thing lol
probably would lol
haha think vr game arent usually heavy enough issue good vr capable card flight sim especially modded skyrim take vram run mod list skyrim vr literally cant run well even 4090 unless use dlss

4tb ssd full 2 year fact try deleting everything dont want keep currently planing buying 2 x4 tb ssds add pc
1tb good amount type use case personal experience tho college 15tb fill pretty quick game like cod school file arent deleted dont need shouldnt much problem make sure file neat use like google drive store file cloud instead directly pc dont immediately need fell rabbit hole type ssds make sure ssd buy either dram hmb really help drive speed consistency personal research western digital blue sn580 cheap durable ssd look like released better model wd blue sn5000 like 2 extra buck 1tb 2tb actually save like 5 buck

ngl day fortnite cod take lot space especially new update likely want download game 2tb minimum id say preferably thankfully day cheaper ever
would get 4tb imo currently 32tb exos drive 11tb used crazy world live ssd o game hdd storage
depends would personally feel comfortable 1tb modern machine formatting going take 100gb window going take well 20gb start continue grow stuff continues accrue like registry entry browser history stuff like could use window drive compress help stretch space come performance penalty personally went little overboard 18tb ssd space time could help saw good deal ssd put foot stop im never going use space anyway 1tb might forced juggling mean uninstall thing arent using make room something using vice versa dont forget also good practice leave portion ssd empty help move data around better use overprovisioning want set space aside purpose hidden use whatever app come ssd example corsair use corsair software 2tb would give extra breathing room smart keep computer well cleaned organized may able make 1tb work really
1 tb ssd downloaded 5 game already half full dont file
15tb sweet spot one 1tb 512gb could install half steam library 120 game forza 3 4 flight sim 1tb bare minimum 24001800 mb enough heat last waaaay longer loading time literally instantaneous
nope also leave atleast 10 headroom data written drive 90 full die quicker cod nearly 200gb install warzone everything else fortnite get towards 100gb youve got o 1tb go run space almost instantly
lifelong system engineer dont love hoarding data better multiple smaller drive youre using redundant setup failure youre ever going lose maximum storage drive would comfortable losing 256gb data losing 1tb

agree 4 tb perfect
way
right answer road youre finding youre running space often buy another
yep economical buy 1 tb buy another 1tb later long enough slot instead buying 2tb use less 1 tb know 2tb cheaper 2 1tb drive 1 tb plus 1 tb later im sure cheaper 1 tb later cheaper 1 tb might even pleasant surprise even needing 1 tb whole pc life cycle like 400 gb video ethically sourced course heh couple game heck genshin 100 gb wtf give u ability delete previous quest like mobile hoyoverse still 180 gb free though delete game im finished like marvel spiderman nier automaton detroit become human name chonky game

compatible yes good part least gaming build optimal cpu great pick day mobo probably expansive ssd great im sure u find something better price u mentioned r u anyway cpu go like ryzen 5600 u bigger budget u get ryzen 7600 use stock cooler save money get one cpu compatible mobo ram use list find better nvme httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1b27j9ndpu3cnlj2hkcrfpjkhkofoi1dbuuqva2gt4htmlviewgid0httpsdocsgooglecomspreadsheetsd1b27j9ndpu3cnlj2hkcrfpjkhkofoi1dbuuqva2gt4htmlviewgid0 money saved get better gpu would say least 10gb vram like least 67006700xt6750xt
find tomshardware review spec corsair cant bothered put enough spec website atx connector 204 pin go right side board also 44 pin eps12v go one 8 pin cpu power connector top left board also modular 44 eps12v plug fully supply board seems come extra cable plug second 44 fine build im surprised pcpp flagged click link doesnt say anything psu must upgrade bios asus board installing cpu unfortunately kinda need cpu think hopefully come right bios
youll fine update bios dont get cpu seller
around price able get much better gold rated psu worry enough connector want one 2 cpu power connector get 9800x3d b580 either get less expensive cpu much nicer gpu
thank much checking understand im good go psu want use cpu install right bios mobo need cpu word specific b660plus tuf asus board likely wont support 9800x3d
really dimension wise itll ok pin mobo psu conflict also wont ill get dedicated website includes bundle likely second hand
really cant get better psu denmark im doubling price current psu thats really wanted fit component gpu wise ill probably get second hand 4070
youre gon na hope come updated bios find equivalent b850 board go
spend less much cheaper cpu 9800x3d overkill 4070 even 7600x would plenty gaming psu last place want cheap go bad could damage whole system strongly suggest getting least gold rated psu good warranty
wouldnt guarantee consistent 240 fps cpu intensive game seek
600 euro really good build congrats enjoy
youre enjoying tinkering want continue budget look repairing retro computer ive repairing old c64s pick cheap flip make money youll learn soldering skill learn lot electronics electricity general everything need youtube great hobby learn carry modern pc well

ive using throwing star sorry bois
called supply demand intel fukked hugely
looking cpu am4 specifically guess many am4 skus outofproduction causing supply chain issue unscrupulous seller charging premium scarcity
tariff coming people building box everything shoot price even one people
thats best am4 cpu buy right 5800x3d sold awhile making 5700x3d probably follow soon youre building new consider am5 price get platform probably worth difference point bought used am4 build cheap locally worth looking got 5600x a580 350 see ton 400600 locally cheaper could build case
get aliexpress theyre still 190200 moment reputable seller still long way 160 selling couple month ago think even cheaper one point
felt lucky scoring 7950x3d last year price going nut people buying 7800x3d got 7950x3d cheaper 7800x3d im feeling even better purchase live au alot excess stock routed u thanks panic buying tarriffs
u least people buying tariff kicking elsewhere likely supply drying people buying new system use 5000 series see 5700x3d rtx5070 super popular budget combo next couple year able get hold good price guess would r7 7700 5700x3d alternative due price people wanting am5 budget futurefocused cpu light game starting make use 8 core
almost certainly 5700x3d longer production supply drying like 5800x3d
bought one 230 newegg less 2 week ago
stop making thing supply price go
amd top dog almost everyone recommending build amd moment honestly reason lead shortage amd didnt predicted intels chip would noncompetitive book capacity tsmc far advance competing many company apple nvidia intel gpus etc like call like need 25 capacity running 100 intel would get head ass accept defeat 2 need start lowering price cpu make appealing thus bringing competition back amd doorstep
live near microcenter 220 right could get 7600x moboram 300 new microcenter right probably sell old stuff 200300 ebay got 130 am4 motherboard used 50 32gb ddr4 stick said got 415 cpu said done fee made 450 ebay selling moboramcpu paid 750 9800x3dam5 board32gb ddr5 honestly sell am4 motherboardram cpu go am5 itll cost little last longer upgradeable
piss market
7950x europe went 425 525 stock major retailer
got 7800x3d 350 euro 2023 500 euro sure
major gpu release mean people build new system
oof even aliexpress cpu higher price think might gg
bummer dude got 5700x3d month back around 150 microcenter
live u check news
upcoming tariff
election consequence
american vote vote fall line 51 voter answer american american cpu price ignore american yeah getting exactly voted dont get ask something happen happens play victim
lucky live near micro center got one 2 week ago 180 might worth trip far
buy used buy 2 gen older end world
think everyone gearing raise price u tariff bought mine like 3 month ago 150
thats funny bought 7700x 3 week ago 300 instead 330 paid suck shopping
200 5700x3d discount price holiday sale plain simple
still get 5700x3d 200 microcenter aliexpress option yeah pretty much everyone else saying demand really high holiday season company putting thing sale msrp 5700x3d 249 normal part year itll cost around major retailer
got 5700x3d 180 sale last month honestly kind pay attention holiday deal come
ali express szcpu store still 200 wont let link reason bought one store month ago complaint
price older part always place cause unstable supply price current cpu usually stable ryzen 5 7600 ryzen 7 7700 7800x3d price didnt change much past month
case lga1700 intel cpu pretty sure 14600k still cheapest ever
uncertainty market price based people willing pay rightly wrongly believe want going 400 next month might willing pay 300 today something could gotten 200 last month
noticed hesitated get one instead choosing gamble lose somehow picked different storefront thought lmao ali express lower price 50 60 buck higher started looking kinda hoping amazon would get big shipment theyd drop back 5700x 5800x significantly cheaper still there always
got mine 209 last year 5800x3d still thing supply diminishing
look like people buying likely new build 50 series 70 class amd gpus 5700x3d damn good price intel basically running gaming cpu worthwhile unless plan heavy medium stuff
aliexpress still around 198 microcenter 210 there still option brodie ali take time tho took month get mine
even aliexpress price gone 50 5700x3d
trump tariff preparation edit looking online seems purely 5700x3d thing
would suspect 50 srries coming talk lot people wanting build new system less sale following logic retailer
new generation gpus lot big spender looking upgrade pc build new one upgrading part building using old gpu get hand new top line one people probably also ordering ordering new system si might stockpiling cpu otherwise perhaps anticipation tariff
nobody want intel cpu plus lot people switched away 13th 14th gen due failure supply issue
popular cpu right given actual performance gain gaming get cheaper couple hundred youll take bit risk looking aliexpress fortune buying one local brickandmortar pc store country 200 pop tray box fan pretty much dodging bullet
even europe bought friend 5700x3d 180 2month ago least 250
price going x 3d compared newer x3d cpu cost 100 150 would say quite cheap since also possibly keep older ram dont mind using
theyre production still offer good performance id look benchmark x3d chip generally excellent gaming whatever technobabble reason main feature excessive amount l3 cache something add lot performance game also wort even 300 arguably yes cpu ludicrous amount l3 cache specifically make x3d chip good gaming im sure intel even amd chip price range compete even newer one either lack extra cache wayyy expensive
scalper apparently unheard concept manufacturer sell authorized dealer screw market
starting go stock writing wall unless amd another batch coming dont think youre going get one retail price anymore
demand going amd cpu hot stuff right basically entire top 10 best selling cpu diy market amd cant keep production intel barely exists anymore diy market without oem market would bailed government security reason thats jab joke
yup ive noticed curious cost versus 150 paid 5700x3d aliexpress beginning month cant say ali totally safe limit experience havent problem ordering pleased constant notification tracking long tracking info meaning still went quiet week let know passed custom notified day delivery youre interested id google buying cpu aliexpress something effect basic gist order vendor sold thousand high rating oh forgot mention put new cpu system 2 day ago working fine producing expected result
algorithm got installed 10 year ago major store sadly price yoyo time opposed downward trend used see due age put tracker want buy let shopping
think bought 7800x3d 300 usd shoulda bought bunch sold em profit new box
xeon w 2135 5 less 6 moth ago
think halo effect x3d model amd whole compared intel
probably massive intel fuck caused many people look cpu alternative marvel rival blizzard put popups issue week back launcher
got ryzen 5500 84 im happy gaming rig 7600 30 paid nearly year ago
usa perhaps looking something tariff maybe demand due fear tariff
5700x3d still widely available aliexpress really good price
bought qtj1 8c16 i9 10900hk 1151 mutant today 67 bad
grabbed 5700x3d local micro center 180 last weekend 220 still 25 available
new gpus people preparing new system everyone want amd amd cant keep demand law supply demand kick amd blame intel uncompetative really twist knife
wait tariff pc get 25100 expensive american
greed
lot people old platform movingupgradingbuilding new pc sold used 5800x3d 415with taxship ebay month ago paid 350 came motherboard 32gb ddr4 memoryso daughter got free moboram upgrade made money back kit newer game also cpu killer there 1020 game 2022 need better cpu struggle
supply demand either supply going demand going
5800x3d doesnt appear manufactured amd probably ramping production others well 7000 8000 9000 series produce didnt think am4 would last forever
tariff affecting
rthankstrump
5700x3d im assuming supply side pond drying got one aliexpress like 155 tho highest ive seen like 180 buy someone high number item sold youll good
bro recipet 7800x3d actually went value course 6 month
dang make sense throw please
dude httpswwwredditcomrunexpectedcomments1i7afrctestingwhichcpuisthefastest
wow executorman
old pentium cpu use comb lol
maybe throw higher end one way dont aim vitals please
also new video card coming people start upgrade cycle 5700x3d best am4 cpu gaming people want upgrade entire system snap also arent produced quantity anymore theyre legacy part
happened intel
intel fukked hugely thats true regardless
intel fucking seems pretty much new normal
supply command ricky would say
huge anymore actually kind funny degradation issue basically verified fixed recommended setting available afraid issue still qa issue affected pretty small batch specific cpu intel extended warranty even upgraded people people act like still ongoing see people including amd gpus shit intel cpu efficiency heat efficiency difference amd gpu make saving amd cpu theyll suddenly care performance per dollar nothing else matter besides raw frame per dollar look benchmark realistic benchmark 4090s 720p low show overall people resolution setting gpu choice apart esports people amd intel cpu well little difference game people take game intel doesnt good run amd cpu gpu buyer ignore game amd gpus arent good end day whatever want people probably dont need spend hundred extra x3d chip look benchmark work best type game play
looking amd chip outside am4 well havent compared intel
5700x3d still production available microcenter 210 180 last year still deal available people within reasonable driving distance microcenter store itll almost certainly increase price go production ryzen 9600 announced imagine amd leave am4 behind sometime year
time released new am4 sku made leftover silicon found couch cushion
bought stuff new build second elected lol
originally going build around black friday year decided move case tariff everything except gpu right
""
completed build
really didnt need upgrade coming 5800x tariff pretty much confirmed gon na end regretting putting hoping 9800x3d last next 56 year
also one people took hour long trip microcenter today secured loot
ive already stocked electronics tech stuff beforehand
walked micro center yesterday scooped 9800x3d bundle gathering expensive part
way also ever wanted get retro gaming handhelds would time pull trigger
tariff war trump invades canada mexico greenland panama trade break completely money become nearly worthless inflation follow path germany enjoy peace last
got 115 5700x3d october aliexpress loving came 3600 night day improvement game
ive never used aliexpress seems shady
1 vouch aliexpress got 5700x3d 140 took age arrive well worth lot people youtubers done issue
bought mine aliexpress week ago us160 shipping quickly installed day ago
recommendation reputable seller aliexpress
yeah bought 7950x3d like 400 usd sale directly amazon little less year ago feel like happened buy cpu ideal time price definitely lucked edit 470
considering used gpu steam 3060 next budget build include 5060 maybe 5060ti
see 5700x3d rtx5070 super popular budget combo next couple year able get hold good price strategy run together still use good 650750w psu gucci next year
thought saw article two late october claiming official word amd think longer manufactured everyone selling remaining inventory
yeah newegg price like 210 week two ago 300
dont live anywhere near microcenter would lucky get 200 current moboramcpu combo probably like 100150 highend am4 gear 5700x3d end upgrade path aware year away core refresh
went mc 200 last week 180 start month
think view getting way logic cpu becoming scarce obviously go price
removed
far unfortunately
220 bah
yeah ive kept eye szcpu usually 13 listing 5700x3d three difference price 170 180 190 last looked right there one listing 198
x model significantly less powerful though
im hour away nearest m sure much trust ae say good thing
anticipation tariff likely
highest thats lowest price
advice shady people advising
cpu
looked gpu line ups decided 3080 another two year new motherboard necessary get 5700x3d call day well guess wait week demand drop bit bet enough inventory chip
isnt 5800x3d best gaming 5700x3d lower budget
yep picked one month ago exact reason look like ahead curve picked mine new cool 130
new gpu gen got thinking upgrading price came fucked thinking max rest system existing gpu upgrading cpu meantime till better gen hopefully come
calling 5700x3d legacy wild
intels cpu dookie everyone buying amd
cpu long term lifespan concern 13th 14th gen allegedly fixed wont necessarily know sure lot people would rather trust latest cpu release underwhelming mean game fine good chip amd putting throw tendency change socket frequently closing upgrade path compared amd socket lifespan people even less reason recommend
fucked hugely
got complacent made bad business decision whole amd passed
google intel ring bus hot carrier injection basically midrange 13 14 gen processor ticking time bomb
zero reason buy intel cpu gamers almost reason buy intel cpu nongamers youre drawing 2x power less performance costing nobody gon na buy cpu especially power draw ridiculous 5800x3d draw 60w gaming 12900k equivalent performance draw like 150w gaming 13th 14th gen even worse talking stress test load gaming load intel consumes least double power matter especially there performance uplift really really bad top 13th 14th gen microcode bug basically slowly destroys cpu time unless patched supposedly
fast faster amd run hot
go am5 dont am4 motherboard yet
dont intel terrible amd option cpu game right intel pull shit back together
whats left 4500x3d
nov everyone 1500 blow given time especially holiday lot people probably waited get christmas way big expense theyre jumping upgrade train late
going wait situation partner got gpu upgrade since decent last gen amd system old 4gig card covid time im struggling decide drop another 300 16 gig card well mine older amd 8 gig
got 5700x3d aliexpress 135 since bought 1111 day coupon work flawlessly
got one 150 fine make sure seller lot sale good rating dont buy one like 20 sale
shady also great every page full great deal hardtofind hardware page full 1000 counterfeit fraudulent item like good true sd card usb drive ssds depends seller youre looking cant find something amazon ebay absolutely use aliexpress next stuff find amazon ebay probably come aliexpress save money ordering directly wait longer shipping ive great support whenever issue well actually felt bad one seller controller got didnt work expected simply refunded full amount without expecting ship back china youtube channel called dawid tech stuff order thing lot aliexpress test review get legit good stuff everything get good quality legitimate product legitimate seller
like amazon newegg walmart seller take pick wary
make sure youre right store page somehow went back different store front smaller sale instead reputable one meant buy scam attempted get refund sent bullshit tracking info though said ive seen people say szcpu trustworthy literally 178 buck last night refreshed went 20 buck lol 200 think small gamble import fee getting caught skirt something though
shadier amazon site seller look review youre buying make sure there plenty positive review seller return window work
got 7500f 110 took like month ship
shadiness much different amazon ebay ive buying least 2 dozen item aliexpress since 2016 reached safely never bought pc component tho many official chinese brand selling directly rheadphones rflashlight rbudgetkeebs user commonly buying respective hobby stuff ali
yeah used couple time got scammed twice seems like really hit miss
people bought 4090s got 4050s 4090 lazer printed anyway
sketch fuck im
bought mine 150 160 tax chose seller 1000 sale mine luckily arrived within week
listing show many unit seller sold find seller thats sold least 100 unit youll fine
probably considering 5070 12gb vram sure theyll popular 2025 8gb wouldve previous year
thats crazy
ok insane still get 221chf wilk wait sub 200
newegg outside vendor sort like difference sold amazon seller site external vendor usually one ludicrous pricing
youd surprised youre am4 motherboard probably worth 100 ram worth 25 per 16gb
market around world also cpu generally continue go price new generation release
think view getting way logic cpu getting scarce cause people buying told selling well expectation dramatic price increase tariff people trying beat
answer going cpu price get life

oh wow didnt realize went fast
dont trust aliex much either thishttpsamdcpualiexpresscomstore1101244590 shop found suggested lot bought 5700x3d supposedly there protection place aliex case need refundreplace good luck 7
ill let know ordered 2 week two different store ali first one updated tracking info frequently say left china
sure today yeah price aliexpress change almost daily bought partner 5700x3d around 180 jumped 147 tax 155 market vigilance pay
listening dude story
think meant reply commenthttpswwwredditcomrbuildapcs9inpheruul sure happened kind funny
5700x3d demand gon na drop week gon na go due new gpu release buy wait like 6 month
honestly plan keeping 7800xt gpu little faster 3080 avg least til 20282030 1440p
true dont think cpu even available anymore cant find stock anywhere
5800x3d best hit bump month ago supply dwindling getting one new right isnt even close value money 5700x3d practically next available sensible one also jump 100200 going rate am5 upgrade start looking like path even folk would upgraded cpu instead
amd stopped production 5800x3d 7800x3d technically pick 5700x3d 9800x3d anything else leftover old stock
5800x3d original better pretty much longer available 5700x3d likely produced lower binned chip didnt quite make 5800x3d spec werent exactly trash
performance difference two massive 5700x3d easy get low price aliexpress quite time idk thats still case
difference two apparently large price 5700x3d make huge value
game noticeably better part within spitting distance plus 5800x3d discontinued time burning whatever 5700x3d stock still remains
theyre similar realworld application
5800x3d production 1 digit performance difference two technically 5800x3d best similar performance guess due availability 5700x3d best upgrade
production least 6 month
fairly new chip old platform would still consider legacy
way generation intel dookie besides change naming convention
true recently bought intel im happy always
bigly
thought i9 line
messed microcode literally burn without bios update fix fixed micro code perform basically clocked voltage past point failure bench high die understand correctly
degrade fail

ive am4 year
intel ultra line fine effiecient 14th gen ultra 5 outperforms 9600x 9700x outperforms 9600x 50 cinebench multicore amd best option purely gaming x3d productivity budget build depends country price
admit fomo cpu especially saw bunch indicator price gon na go wait month 9800x3d bought 78 600eur around beginning december last week saw 9800x3d stock 580 thought wtf quickly checked term found bought around holiday could return end january first thing next daygood thing didnt build yet still new unused issue return already got new cpu running
live close mc im gon na go line morning hope best youre rush wait feb get data along 5070 series launch make decision
could share link seller dm want pls
even return policy needed
november wife 150 aliexpress pick top seller lot review wait week worked like charm good go year
normally buy retailer seller yeah
dont vet seller platform youre blindly taking gamble see scam chinese vendor little review new account ebay amazon would different chinese marketplace
seller buy
wouldnt buy gpu aliexpress cpu seem pretty good
personal experience
probably bought seller also remembered key collecting coupon guess get spending certain amount something otherwise wouldve like 170 actually ordered small thing paying like fifth wouldve paid couple usb cable small thing site quite gem certain stuff
4070ti super 16gb start drop due 5070 5070ti might see build
might go
motherboard probably worth 100 get b550m vdh wifi 90 new 2 m2 wifi board op board longer doubt well featured 25 per 16gb thats price 2x8gb 3200cl16 brand new managed get people spend second hand thats great really worth
paid less 100 motherboard new thats like 2 year ago
top line cpu eol socket many use niche case
whats explanation arent american buying cpu america issue exist worldwide right
bowling
maybe misunderstood something
hmm true yeah talked aliexpress
yea milk every drop am4 platform gpu complete overhaul new ssd hdds many outdated small storage device dont need anymore since human included inherently lazy probably wont 2030 mostly play stuff like factorio dsp anyways lol
best chance secondhand discordfb marketplace sometimes get lucky someone upgrade am5
dont realize new jedec standard released usually older standard longer made find new like newegg leftover stock youll notice newegg there 2 actual skus 5700x3d everything else stock refurbishedused newegg sku used likenew 5800x3d 450 also showing stock mean finding stuff upgrade am4 system going become harder harder find price may come may continue upward trend stock get tighter
got mine ebay month ago 450 came 3800x worth every penny
thats im currently 5900x want jump am5 question 7800 9800x3d
uhh seen 7800x3d price 5700x3d upgrade still much cheaper 7800x3d am5 platform youll want x3d vcache ryzen 7600 paper get average fps similar 5800x3d practice feel afford get vcache cpu dont vcache cpu thinking entering argument based graph tedchtubers stop cache delivers gaming benefit dont see avg even 1 low fps every gamer unless youre budget get suitable x3d cpu hence price sky high
even 5800x3d available getting sold weekly basis retailer low yield 5700x3d much better yield actually stockpile built failed 5800x3ds thats probably seeing price go stock likely depleted
yeah 9095 performance 5066 cost problem 5800x3d got expensive upgrading am5 system became cost effective
generation quality unconfirmed previous generation would seppuku
maybe physical chip failure due internal corrosion

dont think mainstream card unlessuntil price hit price 3060 card started used card steam 3060 first started top gpus steam summer 2024 ie 335 year introduced dont expect 4070ti super high used steam card next couple year course much higher priced price 3060 seems ppl buy 3060 msrp price bracket used resolution used game steam 1080p anyway
doubt know local seller 10 stock running stock last couple week guess see price coming

yeah ik ive bought many time aliexpress including 7500f issue asking bought probably bought random seller reputation
already finding 4070ti ti super dropping 1020 due imminent arrival 5070 people forget card race bottom
who local seller
ive got am4 asrock b450m steel legend micro atx edit look like theyre going 4080 ebay
thats like opinion man
dummy gon na dumb
thats thought 3080ti right id probably try jump 50 series gpu well
snag one best buy 47999 ill definitely go 9800x3d problem ill learn run bot something order
uk there 40 difference 9800x3d delivered today
higher framerates much higher 1 01 low smoother gameplay people without x3d cpu envious downvote
reason people arent buying intel right due httpswwwtechradarcomcomputingcpuintelfinallyconfirmsinstabilityissueswith13thgenand14thgencpusarefullyfixedbutsomeownersmaystillbeworried supposedly fixed gen remains seen
right one saying intel cpu unusable ewaste ootbbut vast majority people there reason actually buy intel cpu competition amd mean bad product
sure got 4 haha anywhere 20 100 like f1 sure yeah fun playing application
4fps lmao cope
whatever make believe didnt step rake lol
ive got intel cpu ignore hater repeating something heard influencer paid say oh company getting new ceo guess mean cpu doesnt work anymore lol
intel garbage specifically 12th gen intel failing 10th 11th 13th 14th counting ultra series also failing amd pretty much running circle around year lowmid mid top cpu tell using intel 2009 2021 intel king amazing cpu overpriced crap cant hold amd let people know pc talk
thanks though doesnt make much easier might wait 9950x3d plenty fast enough also good occasional gaming though probably wouldnt notice much rl difference game lot gamers colour calibrated rather old 4k monitor run 60hz would even know im convinced many people would using instead staring benchmark there anything wrong probably end deciding mobo feature whether itll talk nicely na various hw synths itll hanging ill actually use point
digitecch
think worth think might wait 60 series im still playing 1440p far game issue 3080 mean sure cant max ray tracking setting mostly everything run fine 9800x3d im fine fps game
go hotstockio got hand 5 different amazon 9800x3d preorders kept one shipped first cancelled others shouldnt hard took couple day
sure would grabbing 9800x3d enjoy mate beast chip
nothing perfect including intel point glazing one another preference loved intel nvidia since little kid choice forever
also bad product wouldnt buyable one especially past
bro drank loserbenchmark flavor aid
know already thing amd isnt really intel father since beggining
tbh built intel like half price live dont regret
several reason considering 98003xd upgrade 5090 3080ti intel i911900kf firstly recently begun playing rival game terribly optimized secondly recently discovered beauty performance capability dlss dldsr particularly advantageous sadly enough prefer maintain high frame rate found dlss allows upscaling game desktop 5k2k resolution may ideal application provides visually appealing highperformance experience additionally developer utilizes ai tool topaz work machine learning llm tool require high level computational power 98003xds performance capability would enable continue working efficiently effectively
fanboys fanboys im judge asked intel isnt hot right also note whole debacle particularly intel looking new ceo
nothing perfect wild thing say cpu killing ability rma refund
comment incoherent assume mean wouldnt purchased brand amd absolutely crushing intel consumer sale sure intel better built strong reputation following intel cpu world today youre looking build new pc amd cpu provide superior value people consumer reflection market 10 year ago necessarily reflect market today
bro got good deal product everything asked end story
didnt ask intel isnt well told actually good im happy also wan na mention wouldnt mind fanboy werent one 3 best
wouldnt agree people still buying matter chocie wan na mention im repeating fact guy keep getting mad grow realise better thing two someone better something one vice versa
well yeah get good sale intel cpu worth price obviously huge factor price product typically found amd cpu better go ahead enjoy pc need swap cpu doesnt need shouldnt result telling people make inefficient purchase decision
dead
everything else working worried might damaged mainboard psu damage might show later point
nah probably somthing usb circuit port
yeah several back one front next damaged one wouldve thought port next would fried sit board one front usb port thought
well nothing try em dont work consider new case case io front
one front working thats thought might able reanimate one seems dead
rx 7600 better 6600 xt
depends badly need performance much youre willing spare 6600xt like 15 percent better game 20 percent extra cost personally would upgrade money spare really cant think anything else put
worth non xt version around 150 ebay question yeah xt version worth extra 30
6650xt area find new 230 used 150
got 6650xt 120 definitely worth much
6650xt id get around 20 faster 6600 non xt sure verse 6600xt though
man idk know save 100 used 6800 xt would worth understandable cant 240 used 6600 xt isnt great horrible
find 6650xt retail around much
yes good give 3060 performance
cost 6700xt already better choice 7600xt
wont fit budget
j found one 255 good
maybe try find used 6700 non xt got one 175
iirc thats roughly proportional much gain 6650xt 6600xt refresh basically think around 710 faster
theyre priced near
get
would go retail 6650xt spend extra thats prefer retail used trust used market 1
psu offer protection definitely get surge protector
joule rating specific power strip yes
might good precaution use one even though cheap make sure actually handle pc edit fix spelling
depends small surge originates within home sure lightning strike managed reach home chance something like youd need wholehome surge protector tie electrical panel said chance happening pretty low get surge protector reputable brand protect surge originate within house
surge protector worthless really nice high end one nothing brownout fried whole pc 2017 ups ever since well worth even tried use connected device coverage surge protector come denied manufacturer course
buy ups line conditioning cheap protection spike brown out
psu protect part
would cheap tripp lite suffice think im confused cheap surge protector would anything considering 99 people always recommend 100 one online
arent worthless misunderstood use something called metaloxide varistor soak extra voltage degrade use finite lifespan live area frequent surge replace frequently also protect surge specifically brownout drop voltage surge protector nothing
looked brownout im pretty sure ive gotten something like random flickering light though 18 year pcing never system fry however install tankless water heater electric house suck 80amps use light flicker lot run researching say something voltage spike led bulb think would effect pc slowly damage im building new quite expensive pc rn im definitely interested usp ever
damn remember brand failed
well problem one use case huge overvoltages decent psu also protect part problem still damage pc
wrong use case brownout surge either need power conditioner raise voltage backup take technically monitor cut power low would work wouldnt recommend
fyi ups us exact technology surge protection plain old surge protector strip
would buy new psu case safe continue using
well offer guarantee good enough live area thats prone power cut etc
tripp lite make good stuff understand two three surge protector
thank posting parent comment annoyed also worth noting multiple level surge protection always best everyone get high quality type 1 spd installed main electrical panel well sub panel addition surge protection point use location electronics
buy high quality ups itll protect pc screwy voltage make sure product feature list voltage regulation course though really dirty power keep mind battery probably taking dive lieu pc part use vendor software test regularly
either corsair 850 gold evga 850 plat
brownout totally different power surge undervoltage surge protector power conditioner wont raise low voltage
work continue using wont burst power trip
area building im extremely old problem like buzzy humming electrical outlet turned electric wall heater dont trust electrical much money pc
thank
ah ok lcd tv likely damaged power surge pc surge protector
aware psu power doesnt mean isnt damaged old unit worked fine time caused intermittent crash gaming advice add extra layer protection possible 2030 dollar surge protector enough
actually projector lol moved job yeah tell roommate get one havent surge yet 3 month weve risk aint worth feel
go surge protector good
definitely get oled 4k high refresh rate monitor justify cost 5090 build look good
native resolution gaming
lgtm solid choice antec c8 really underrated great case arctic lf3 best performing aio prefer one aesthetic go help cost fan personally went fan fanhub fish tank case way cheaper still look good httpswwwaliexpresscomitem1005006224852502htmlspma2g0oorderlistorderlistmain5264071802ci77fjhttpswwwaliexpresscomitem1005006224852502htmlspma2g0oorderlistorderlistmain5264071802ci77fj httpswwwaliexpresscomitem1005007493166130htmlspma2g0oorderlistorderlistmain6064071802ci77fjhttpswwwaliexpresscomitem1005007493166130htmlspma2g0oorderlistorderlistmain6064071802ci77fj
make sure put cpu aio fan intake 5090 dump 500700w heat case dont want aio using
im also making almost exact build 4k oled
try later year system alone expensive enough dont want buy cheap shit thanks tho
second someone oled 3440x1440 4090 confirm true hdr effect way game look way ray tracing ever wish people would buy 5070 get good hdr monitor instead dumping gpu
im 2560x1440 im planing buying 4k monitor later year
yea know arctic lf3 good one dont like look much also mounting seems bit wacky im expert building pc haha thanks posting fan im kinda set fan since seem damn good term thermal also rgb also 3 aio already thanks man
wait thats new one none build saw 5090 youtubers 3 bottom intake140mm isnt enough
nice hear change whats monitor buying thanks posting
yeah hdr change look game sooo much tried ff7 remake kinda killed overall aesthetic final fantasy cyberpunk tho damn look awesome
long make sure play 4k otherwise would stick 5080 look like solid system minus expensive feeling know want
putting aio top 5090s even fe dump back case lot heat 3rd party card pulling 700 watt dumping heat back aio exhaust using air going work harder normal
im still waiting getting 5090 finger crossed buy part ill grab one 9800x3d microcenter bundle get 5090 also im fully set case yet antec pretty much exactly im looking monitor still stuck pg32ucdm pg27ucdm msi mpg 272urx look really good yet msi mpg 321urx also radar
literally transformative got hdr monitor still 2070 blew mind 4090 gave better fps game good hdr implementation literally zero hit fps mind blowing
yea money wise im high right want spend something last also im selling old pc 1k deal thanks advice tho
going top yeah thanks advice since people seem put top first keep eye review thermal go still thanks advice
yeah im waiting cant grab 5090 point bulding new system see change get one right new aios new case im also thanks writing monitor look
good hear check time new monitor
highly recommended
sorry changed motherboard going see performance upgrade wanted better performance would gpu cpu upgrade wasted money reason got unlucky costed performance dip reason would want new mobo get onto new cpu socket stayed am4 help troubleshoot issue would ddu uninstall gpu driver reinstall gpu chipset driver actually wanted make reasonable upgrade upgrading gpu b580 would value best budget gpu atm cpu good enough there need go am5 still return motherboard use old one im still shocked waste money
playing resolution quality setting xmp enabled bios ram new mobo ram wouldnt much anything gaming performance shouldnt worse cpu temp load hwinfo data seems idling since cpu frequency boosting want data gaming really need frequency temp performance monitor seems normal gpu close 100 load seems working ok
basically throught year changed little little every component build second pc thats bought new motherboard missing part second pc
yes everything ive changed every detail related setting cpu temp around 60c 14v changed 11v stay areound 3238c thing old setup didnt impact perfomance still got 122 fps even 14v fps wont go 90 fps
shouldt need mess voltage setting especially temp normal load clean install window new drive clone old installation would recommend resetting bios default setting clean install window rule bios setting softwaredriver issue
ive already done thing ran solution thats posted reddit maybe niche problem something
sure werent using dlss thats fps higher checked benchmark using gpu game compare performance game getting 85 fps
maybe 2x32 stick p 120 se cooler 710 gpu barely better integrated graphic
ik stel voor dat je voor de huidige generatie cpu socket gaat am5 zodat je veel ruimte hebt voor een upgrade 4 jaar ryzen 8700g en 8600g hebben geintegreerde graphic zodat je geen losse gt710 nodig hebt dan heb je ook een ander moederbord en ram nodig 32gb ram nog prima tenzij en van plan bent om aan videobewerking te doen deze kingston ssd qlc al je voor een lage meerprijs een met tlc kan vinden zou ik die aanraden zelf laatst voor sk hynix gegaan met black friday de goedkoopste goede cpu koeler met 2 stack en 2 fan de peerless assassin 120 se voor office workload de hyper wss goed genoeg let ook op er thermal paste bij de koeler geleverd wordt ik heb het zelf nooit los hoeven kopen al met al kosten deze aanpassingen meer geld dus overweeg per onderdeel je het waard vindt
please dear god spend 600 9800x3d msrp 47999 anything higher scalper pricing fucker really need rewarded bullshit 7800x3d still great cpu 30 difference msrp pricing id rather get 9800x3d
dont buy msrp
spend 600 9800x3d lol get close msrp totally go worth almost 200 price increase besides someone 7800x3d already amazing cpu think put great spot performance whereas diminishing return 9800x3d worth extra cost also possible find 7800x3d cheaper youre diligent patiencedont mind waiting longer got mine 250 last month course thats lucky deal even getting 100 totally possible depending live especially considering people upgrading around time
get 7800x3d less 400 decent deal sure imo like 1015 less performance 9800x3d gon na hold super well even 5090
msrp coming 9800x3d owner
get 7800 worth buying 9800 600
gamers wont matter youd notice big difference gaming low resolution trying push high fps resolution 1080 cpu matter less difference bad cpu great cpu big youre comparing great cpu great cpu id save money
built 7800x3d rig friend year ago 350 amazon 600 sound overpriced id skip x3d mark im running 160 14900k like used part
way looking 9800x3d gpu shopping window 4070 5070 7800x3d enough save extra money try stretch 4080 5080
dont pay scalper price 7800x3d 3090 playing 4k 120hz monitor gpu usually maxed 99 7800x3d sits around 25
thats 9800x3d 480 good cpu launch past year hot item thats always stock scalped end
get hot stock app turn notification 9800x3d took day snag one newegg
whats use case game target resolution frame run 7600x7900xt plenty 4k 120fps gaming
either 400 dont bother stopped waiting normal price got 9700x put money saved beefier gpu
stupid buy 9800x3d anything msrp
yes would spend extra gpu
yes cpu important thing future proof dont decide get new gpu 4 year get whole new pc good cpu change gpu
yes
bro dont buy 9800x3d much want one bad id recommend going rhardwareswap
personally id get ryzen 7600 max gpu budget
get 7800x3d spent 1000 gpu get 7900xtx 4080s
run 7800x3d 4090 superb
7800x3d second 9800x3d enough unless youre trying squeeze everything new 5090 put money towards next tier graphic card 5070ti seems like going sweet spot high end value
good finding fuckin motherboard confusing hell everything want stock also hell motherboards get damn expensive also 9800x3d choice patient youll get one closer msrp bought mine amazon couple week ago came today
reason 9800x3d getting msrp microcenter msrp id downgraded cause tbh didnt need wanted best strategy game play
get 7800x3d still monster cpu
think aliexpress 7500f option always consideration pool talking am5 x3d cpu powerful processor carry endgame x3d want hit market low
7800x3d pair 4080 super 1440p game library make cpu bottleneck helldiver2 fps still hovering around 144fps dont see problem ypu pick 7800x3d tbh dont forget fact turn path tracing run everything 4k native even 12700k job fine game market
nope go 9800
normally id go 9800x3d price
please either wait get 7800x3d either one bottleneck system come gaming
whats funny havent followed market blue wanting upgrade 5800x went newegg found combo deal motherboard 9800x3d msrp done wasnt hard idea people would pay 600 cpu also funny enough next day got email saying motherboard stock refunded cost still got cpu shipped msrp bad thing wait monday motherboard order separately hoping weekend oh well
pp better 7800x3d think could get 309 usd long ago
600 dumb took like 3 day waiting newegg email get one
built 9800x3d paired amd 7800xt 16gb got ta say downright incredible setup capable cyberpunk ultra 1920x1080p avg 275 fps maybe optimistic gtx 1070 ti must got hundred software upgrade got faster time went think 7800xt relatively new could similar case also dont like nvidia right greedy enough bang buck
technically gpu good enough dont see big difference play pubg upgrade
look 7600x3d super close performance cost less half country
bought 9800x3d 600eur lowest price could find stock already option like 650eur 7800x3d 540e crazy expensive 60 eur think made good deal
resolution playing game lower re need cpu higher re need gpu
bro got extra 200 burn msrp cpu get 7800x3d use extra money pick 5080 4080 super instead
got 9800x3d 520 479 msrp plus tax something around 513 pretty much paid msrp price facebook marketplace seller announced 550 negotiated 520 keep eye find good deal
paid 600 9800x3d fair 7800x3d sold online selling north 600 well built new am5 rig want wait longer 80 worth waiting month two cpu available
lol ripoff price bought 7800x3d 300 funny gone price since
cant believe post wanted 9800x3d know waited
sad thing cpu gon na sold price someone anyway lol
use hotstock sends notification let know store get new stock select whatever item youre looking wanted 9800x3d marked notification hotstock within 3 day got one msrp highly recommend patient save 200
dont buy 9800 msrp go stock often warrant paying scalper price patient
u familiar real price scalper price site method suggests realistic price wish way reliably find price without buggering people forum
checked price 9800x3d morning released tray version around 550 euroim europe lowest price 7800x3d find around 450 euro im sorry forgot add post building pc around may use 1650 super buy better gpu buy better gpu around july
yeah bought 9800x3d amazon shipping date sometime next month 479 7800 449 time bought couple week back 9800x3d cant found anywhere 7800x3d gone 479 ill waiting patiently 9800x3d come
600 570 msrp 9800x3d 525 600 great price europe
wait long 7800x3d 350 rising 550 would think price go anytime soon case 7800x3d would 250 logic bought 7800x3d people said im crazy wait till get lower listened people would end paying 550 right price way high need one need one
600 close msrp europe
depends 7800x3d 550 8900x3d 600620 would worth point
nonsense try playing game like tarkov rust factorio satisfactory poe 2 see 2030 fps gain least big improvement 1 low even 2k sometimes 4k kcd 2 come week bet see performance gain misinformation cpu mattering 1080p spread 2025 beyond
best advice thread id argue go even lower cpu am5 always upgrade year 7500f bought 125 aliexpress paired 3080ti beast mode 1440p ill upgrade whatever best am5 cpu platform end
deleted
game setting preset
4k cpu stop mattering
ordered mine amazon msrp 2 week ago expected feb1 supposed arrive yesterday
1080p buy 1440p future
concur exactly dont hotstock premium either failed time able get built first pc last week one got
479 u price 9800x3d
anything msrp could considered either price gouging scalping suppose retailer might markup price difference 100 put firmly either camp finding retail pricing case look directly amd storefronthttpsshopusenamdcomprocessors msrp also looking store physical location well online store tend keep accepted pricing standard bestbuy microcenter two good example inside usa outside usa cant really speak would come person looking determine local pricing honestly asking question forum another good way find building forum question expected yes sometimes question getting asked tiresome since search function place literately built anyone welcome seek input helpful community piece together desktop anyone bothered people asking question open forum avoid scammed frankly go fuck
msrp europe 525 550 absolutely fine would go ahead spend 100 9800x3d yes kinda overkill wont thinking upgrading lomg time
ask may would say
ended friend build back jan 6 mine came couple day ago hopefully soon
ah ol dyslexia kicked didnt notice flipped side thinking usd euro
thats true
7800x3d 9800x3d 30 fps increase tarkov everything else doubt
truegifemotefreeemotespackflipout
he good go 99 game go 7800 op
7800x3d midrange thats gutter level bait right
many game cod horizon fw dead space spiderman remastered cp2077 etc required ill use fsr quality boost frame adjust setting two get desired framerate
change gpu upgrade monitor
around 680 cdn
new gpus getting released less week situation could change quite significantly besides ue5 famously cpudemanding lot popular game releasewill release using engine stalker 2 avowed witcher 4 example dragon dogma 2 cpuintensive kcd 2 op building pc around may buy price difference might become smaller point getting 7800x3d
keep mind many esport game really cpu heavy x3d would help lot
advice still hold pay cdn msrp price stock trickling cc memex price dont fall newegg amazon marking 750 cdn reason
dont know single cpu heavy esport game esports like lol dota 2 cs2 valorant starcraft etc well optimized run potato even tho said require better cpu better gpu competitive fps pretty much unplayable without x3d tarkov rust degree maybe warzone
mean fine 60120 fps good want play game 240480 fps need good cpu
yeah dumb pairing 3080 9800x3d instead old 10900k raised avg frame 6080 130160 tarkov 1440p
r5 2600 stock w 980ti 20 slower 3060 valorant 200fps cs2 150 max setting 1080p tried cs2 competitive lowest setting 1080p italy got avg 280300fps r7 5700x wo oc totally fine assuming cs2 cpu intensive esport game dont really need good cpu esports unless youre pro high ranked player simply want utilize 360hz screen
yes exactly saying enable expo change frequency 6400 6000
would change motherboard probably ram
1 low better 850 better particularly still well 60fps vrr gsyncfreesync would notice 13600k paired 4080 play 1440p fathom paying much see 1 low go 70fps 90100fps pointless
plain simple really cant believe people struggling answer micro code update even dont still worth gpu another story monitor worth incremental increase cpu performance absolutely hang least 2 3 year even itll depend
think worth hard time running whatever app game running want improvement really worth
wrong choice either way really depends need upgrade
op know feel lowly i512600 65w game 4k120 4090 ill get 9800x3d 9900x3d soonish p got ram already ordered asrock b850i lightning wifi itx board yesterday expect see quite nice uplift almost everything although tpus chart show small gain compared 12600k faster cpu got least future game run lot better new gear
easy upgrade gpu later cpu
gaming performance gain 9800x3d allways big compared lot recent cpu especially midtier gpu simulator mmos game like stalker 2 even going good 7800x3d 9800x3d mean 4k 1 low turn 01 low 9800x3d smooth go smoother gaming game blow gain especially matter 1 01 fps even 4k resolution got gpu 4080 cpu upgrade question without mentioning gpu gaming resolution game care get generic response could basicly watch lowbudget centric techtuber follow cpu recommendation popular game place hardware requirement following basic recommendation hit massive miss gaming budget spend meaningfull performance upgrade game actually care
would personally wait next gen x3ds
doesnt kinda matter gpu
nah wait like 1 r 2 year might make sense upgrade powerful cpu
planning purchasing 5090 launch possible considered jump im running 13700k 32gb ddr5 dont think im gon na see much difference open thought
yes am5 platform last another generation make complete sense
""
youre 13600k dont think need upgrade rnprobably game arent running good high setting look
problem spending extra money personally think 13600k good enough 1440p
seems like money sense thing
absolutely waste money barely gain wait couple gen
depends play im playing flight sim 2024 satisfactory lot lately helped ton 9800x3d even 3440x1440p talking going nice nice
make sense experience gaming area 13600k better youll fine awhile better put fund toward gpu better monitor
4090 game would significant jump people thread plain wrong
wanted upgrade i9 9900k ended building entirely new rig cost almost identical
9800x3d far expensive justify upgrade like even without considering motherboard time spent rebuilding pc
making similar jump i9 9900k 32 gb ddr4 3080ti 9800x3d 64 gb ddr5 5080 better cruising 4k60 highway
yes yes
play 1440p 3080ti 12600kf upgrade 9800x3d would get approximately 50fps yeah make sense
3d vcache alone worth make meaningful difference game overall itll definitely faster
yup kinda im looking second opinion since relative big cost least im already using ddr5 im set regard
850usd definitely
flip side op could sell mobo cpu ram hundred like 450 better suddenly completely insane
kind im struggling make decision wondering extra 30 fps really noticable
12600 noticeable difference sure 4k 13th gen dont think much
game like stalker 2 cpu upgrade question without mentioning gpu gaming resolution game care ok ill bite pls excuse hijacking thread stalker 2 main fps game care waited decade 4k 60hz monitor currently researching component high ish end audio production pc id like know processor game would run best monitor assume 5080 least 64 gig ram probably asus creator mobo air cooled passive obviously consider factor instead running one game audio quiet cooling core probably better stability able hang lot gear etc itd nice know could wait 9590x3d job including future monitor upgrade im sick running stuff current potato faster glacier
would rtx 5080 likely
upgrade gpu see get want still 9900k another machine keep upgrading cpu 9900k4090 setup waste money
setup likely 4k240
wouldnt
absolutely impossible
deleted
9800x3dam5 motherboard 650 op need replace ram well would 750 tax shipping fee 850 sound right
1020 better 1 low still going go insane people time wherewithal sell old gear base advice thing basically people
nature lowest 1 frame meaning 99 time youre higher especially vrr wont judder jump vrr max fps 13600k rarely trouble hitting refresh rate cap monitor 165hz time im hitting cap gpu cpu issue
13600k youre pretty safe untill am6next intel whatever small fps uplift clearly worh like 700900 ofc personally think thats waste money especially youre playing aaagames
dependsif yoire playing 100 yes obviously youre playing lot competitive shooter like valorant c go 150 200 yes obviously case probably mainly 1 low help btw number totally random clue much fps get
lower fps game absolutely noticeable
9900k absolutely bottlenecking 4090
horrible advice everyone please ignore 9900k massive bottleneck
haha like way think
play tarkov would

depending monitor obviously
yes
thats another youtube channel fake benchmark dude show 5070ti even yet critical thinking crucial folk
dont assume taking account platform purchase cant throw 9800x3d intel board worth noting well 9800x3d isnt available msrp hell right even stock olaces
im rolling 48 inch lg oled tv gsync frame capped bit

imagine he working nvidia
stock 9800x3d stabilised easily gotten nowadays 479usd ive seen stock best buy newegg amazon bhphotovideo
got msrp minimal effort u anyone u easily track drop buy restock way easier buying 30 series gpus shortage also clear wording prevents misunderstanding said 850 reference 9800x3d jump logic understand meant mentioned hardware several unmentioned hardware well

used play tarkov 4k120hz tv alright 100 fps 1440p180hz monitor got drop factory 100fps ground zero used give even 130fps get drop even 6090fps im sure part new update thats mental also ddr4 let forget would get fps simple switch ddr5 system
