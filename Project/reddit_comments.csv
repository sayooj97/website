1id0kv0,4 sticks of ram one is dead,None,Prize_Nectarine,"Only use the same brand and same size of ram sticks together. Mix and match won’t work, or if it somehow did all your ram will be the speed and size of the slowest/smallest in the system. Also don’t place them right next to each other leave one space free between the ram sticks unless you have enough of the same ram to fill all slots. Look at your motherboard manual for confirmation but usually closest to the CPU and third from cpu for two ram sticks.

TLDR: remove both old 8gb sticks and replace with new 16gb sticks leave one slot free between the new ones.

Edit: after you put in new ram sticks your pc might take a couple minutes to start first time because the ram sticks have to be trained the first time after that everything should start quick.",1

If you're making a leap from older generations then the 5080 is absolutely amazing value. especially when 4090's are scalped to shit (they're 3500+ AUD here.) 4080 supers make no sense when you can get a 5080 for 200 more ( supers are 1900+ AUD) and the 5090 is fucking insane (5000 AUD)

1id0jkl,"Upgrade from a 1080ti, 5080 or wait for the 5070ti?",siamonsez,KodiakJedi,The problem though is that latency is based off of actual rendered frames. So lets say you are playing a game at 40 FPS in 4k max settings. Sure...you can turn on DLSS and get 160 FPS...but the response / latency is going to feel a little sluggish. I think in certain titles (especially single player games) it won't matter a ton...but in anything competitive...you aren't going to want DLSS on.,1

1id09bs,"Software question. Is it possible to capture PC screen into a tablet, for streaming purposes?",Dangerpizzaslice_Z,imacleopard,"Could have started chugging your question into an LLM and gone from there…

Yes, it’s possible to capture your PC screen to your Honor tablet and stream from the tablet, even with an underpowered PC. Here’s a concise breakdown of practical methods:

—

### **Best Options**  
#### 1. **HDMI Capture Card (Wired, Most Reliable)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Connect your PC’s HDMI output to a USB capture card (e.g., Elgato Cam Link, Magewell, or budget-friendly options like UGREEN).  
     - Plug the capture card into your tablet via USB-OTG.  
   - **Tablet Setup**:  
     - Use an Android app like **USB Camera Pro** or **Larix Broadcaster** to read the HDMI feed.  
     - Stream directly via apps like **Streamlabs Mobile** or **PRISM Live**.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Low latency, high quality.  
     - Offloads encoding to the tablet (Snapdragon 6 Gen1 handles it well).  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires purchasing a capture card (~$50–$150).  

#### 2. **NDI over Network (Wireless, Free/Software-Based)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Install **OBS Studio + NDI Plugin** on your PC.  
     - Use **NDI HX Camera** (Android app) to receive the NDI feed on your tablet.  
     - Stream via **Larix Broadcaster** or similar apps.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - No extra hardware.  
     - Good for moderate-quality streaming.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires a strong Wi-Fi network (5 GHz recommended).  
     - Slightly higher latency.  

#### 3. **RTMP Restreaming (Advanced)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Use OBS on your PC to stream to a local RTMP server (e.g., **Restream.io** or a self-hosted server).  
     - Use the tablet to pick up the RTMP feed and rebroadcast it.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Flexible, no hardware needed.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Complex setup; relies on PC encoding (may strain an underpowered PC).  

—

### **Other Ideas**  
- **Screen Mirroring + Tablet Capture** (e.g., **Splashtop**, **scrcpy**):  
  - Mirror the PC screen to the tablet, then use screen-recording apps.  
  - **Limitations**: Android often blocks app-based screen capture for DRM/security reasons.  

—

### **Verdict**  
- **Recommended**: **HDMI Capture Card** for reliability and quality.  
- **Budget Option**: **NDI** if your network is strong.  

Your idea isn’t stupid—it’s a smart workaround for offloading streaming from a weak PC. The Snapdragon 6 Gen1 in your Honor tablet can handle encoding, especially at 720p/1080p. Test with free tools like NDI first, but invest in a capture card for long-term use.  

**Pro Tip**: Keep your tablet plugged in during streams to avoid battery drain.",1

1iczqbh,Please let me know If this is a good Part list,Description_Wild,Tasty-Wait831,"Recommendations
CPU: Make sure you've got the right CPU model. If it's the Ryzen 5 7600X, that's a solid pick for gaming. If you have some extra cash, think about upgrading to a Ryzen 7 for more cores.
Cooling: If you want better temps or a quieter setup, consider getting a better CPU cooler.
Budget Check: Keep an eye on your total cost to stay within that €1700 budget, especially if you're thinking about upgrades like a cooler or a fancier CPU.
Overall, your list looks pretty good for gaming on a budget. Tweaking the CPU and cooler could boost performance and help them last longer, depending on what you need and how much you can spend.",1

1iczpf3,Is there a market for used parts?,Redhood101101,psimwork,"Ebay is usually the easiest. I've been selling used parts on there..pretty much since it started. But be advised - you're going to lose ~15% to fees (especially if you promote your listings). 

And buyers can also be a bit of a pain-in-the-ass. I've not yet had someone try to scam me on returns, but I have had plenty of people that will make a last minute bid, win an auction, and then minutes later send me a message asking me to cancel the sale - that they just placed a bid ""to see if they could win"". 

I also really don't like that they moved to their own payment system rather than using paypal. I totally get WHY they did this, but in the past, I didn't pull the money out of paypal until the return window had closed. Now in-order to avoid being classified as a bank, Ebay sends your payout (less fees) almost immediately. 

Also be aware that ALL of the benefit of the doubt is on the buyer and that buyer protection (naturally) is heavily biased towards any issues the buyer may have, whether-or-not it has anything to do with you or the item you've sold. 

Customer buys a used motherboard that is DDR2 only and they expected to be able to use DDR3? Guess what - they will probably initiate a return, saying that your listing didn't reflect what they received, and you're going to end up eating the shipping cost to them, and sometimes eating the shipping cost to return it. HOPEFULLY if they return it, they'll properly package it before sending it back. But given that shit happens sometimes, if you send an item out, the customer decides to return it (even if it's legitimate reasons), and it gets smashed by the USPS, you're probably going to eat all of it - cost to ship to customer, cost to ship back to you. And getting a payout on USPS insurance isn't easy (if there IS any insurance). USPS loses the item? Even with insurance? If everything worked as it should, the CUSTOMER is the one that should be going to USPS and filing a claim that they lost the item you shipped. But chances are they'll complain to ebay, and ebay will do a 100% refund which will pull right out of your bank. 

Also some buyers will make really weird claims about the condition of the item, but will classify the feedback as positive, so that you have no recourse to get it removed. I had one guy say that I damaged the USB ports on a motherboard that I shipped to them. I know this was flat out un-true, but because it was a positive feedback, I couldn't challenge it. Same thing with a surface tablet that I sold - I had a tempered glass screen protector on it from about five minutes after I bought it, to the last moment before I took the picture to put it up for sale. I then got a ""positive"" feedback that said I lied about the condition of the screen and that it had a deep scratch right in the center. But again - it was ""positive"" feedback, so I couldn't challenge it. It's really weird, and I do NOT understand why people do this. 

Anyway.. this may all sound like I don't like selling on ebay, but that's not true. For the most part, it's a really good way to get rid of old parts for which you have no more use. Additionally, some hardware sells for a lot more than you may expect. If you've got hardware that is several generations old, for instance, there is a surprising market for ""retro battlestations"" and hardware that is still operating. I sold some old DDR1 RAM a while ago. Is it going to sell as much as it did new? Of course not. But it sold for like $20, which is more than the $0 I would have gotten if I had sent it to tech recycling (which is what I was previously planning on doing).",1

1iczp94,Should I change my psu? I5 14400f + RTX 2080TI,KindheartednessOk196,DesertEagleFiveOh,You're probably right on the edge of maxing out your PSU when under full load. My 2080ti pulls 335watts under load. I had been running it with some xOC settings on my 32gb ddr4 and my 8700k for a number of years with a 750watt supply though and it worked fine.,1

1iczp94,Should I change my psu? I5 14400f + RTX 2080TI,KindheartednessOk196,psimwork,"PCPP has this as a max draw estimate of ~500W. This is pretty close to the 550W peak output rating for me to be comfortable, so I would probably upgrade the power supply sooner than later. 

If you don't want to change the power supply, I would look into under-volting your 2080Ti, and power limiting your 14400F to around 110W.",1

Does Undervolting/Powerlimiting affects performance ?",1
1iczp94,Should I change my psu? I5 14400f + RTX 2080TI,KindheartednessOk196,DesertEagleFiveOh,Doesn’t really matter. My gpu wasn’t overclocked and was pulling 335 watts. You’re looking at 225 watts total available power after factoring in ONLY your gpu. I don’t think 225 watts is enough headroom before for any kind of gaming.,1
1iczp94,Should I change my psu? I5 14400f + RTX 2080TI,KindheartednessOk196,psimwork,"It *CAN* but it doesn't necessarily have to. 

Power limiting the CPU will probably reduce some performance, but nothing that you're likely to notice. I would guess at MOST you'd lose 2%. And probably not even that much. More likely is that you won't lose any performance because in gaming, the CPU isn't likely to pull its full 148W. The power limitation will just prevent it in the case that it DOES want to do so. 

As for under-volting, this one is a bit harder to explain. The main thing to keep in-mind about it is that there is absolutely no risk to the hardware by attempting to under-volt (as opposed to increasing voltage to get a more stable overclock - that DEFINITELY has a risk of damage). 

Under-volting can be thought of as a weird mix of power restricting *AND* overclocking. The way the graphics card operates, the graphics card will increase its clockspeed automatically (AKA boosting or dynamic overclocking). This is built into the graphics card itself (the founder's edition 2080 Ti, for instance, ran at a base clockspeed of 1350MHz with a boost clockspeed of 1635MHz). 

Now with the automatic clockspeed boosting, the card basically says, ""for [x] amount of clockspeed, increase the voltage intake by [y]."" Some folks will then manually overclock the card, but as they manually overclock it without under-volting (or sometimes over-volting), that causes the power limiter to kick in and the card is like, ""Nope. Not doing that.""

Under-volting, then, creates a voltage curve that basically says, ""run at [x] clockspeed with [z] voltage"" (where [z]) is a lower value than the default. If you keep the clockspeed values the same as default, it's possible to reduce the voltage being fed to the card. The GPU designer, wanting to ensure max stability, will often err on the higher-end of voltages, while not so high that it starts to cause damage. So what ends up happening is that the card takes more power than it really NEEDS, but the engineers know that the GPU will run stable. If you under-volt it, you CAN start to run into some instability (but again - NO risk of damage. If you start to have crashes or whatnot, you can just remove the under-volt settings and try again). 

So it's actually *POSSIBLE* that by under-volting, and manually overclocking, you can actually achieve MORE performance than if you ran the card stock. But silicon lottery being a thing (i.e. some computer chips overclock better than others), this is never guaranteed. 

Most of the time, however, under-volting is generally about power savings. I'm not sure how well the 2080 Ti under-volts, the RTX 3000-series (and especially the RTX 3080) was where under-volting became really a thing. I was able to retain my stock clockspeed (AKA no performance loss), and drop the power usage by about 10%. 

Now it follows that if you (generally) need more voltage to achieve higher clockspeeds, if you LOWER clockspeeds, you would also need less voltage. But this is where the performance loss can come in (hence - under-volting CAN result in performance loss, but it doesn't necessarily have to). 

The 10% power savings was good, but I wanted to reduce the power consumption further, as it was getting hot as balls in my office in the middle of summer, and I was willing to accept a small loss in performance in order to reduce the heat output from my computer. In all, I was able to drop my performance by about 6% by lowering the clockspeed, but I was able to achieve a rock solid (i.e. no artifacts or crashing) power reduction of *almost 40%* (from 378W at peak, down to as low as 210W). And for what it's worth, not that I care, but my graphics card temperatures dropped from 84C under load to a max of about 62C. 

Yes, there was some performance loss, but to give you a bit of a wider view as to how little that mattered, I was gaming at 4K/60 at the time, and a 6% loss in performance meant that my FPS dropped from about 74 FPS in the games I was playing, down to about 69 FPS. A mere 5 FPS loss - nothing I was ever going to notice. 

As a result of all of this (as my flair would indicate), I've become a bit of an Undervolting evangelist.",1

1icz0fl,does it matter what slot i put  my m.2,chisio1102,AConant,I do not know your board but some boards like mine will document if there is a shared PCIe lane. You want to probably keep the M2 on its own lane separate from the GPU. You will need to look at the board docs,2
1icz0fl,does it matter what slot i put  my m.2,chisio1102,psimwork,"The person that told you that is both right and wrong. 

According to the [specs page](https://rog.asus.com/us/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b450-f-gaming-model/spec/), there are 3x M.2 ports on the board. The one closest to the CPU has its own CPU lanes. The second shares CPU lanes with the graphics card slot. The third is attached to the chipset. 

Using the secondary M.2 port will actually cause the graphics card slot to run in X8 mode, which cuts its bandwidth in-half. This may-or-may-not matter, depending on which graphics card you're using, but in-general it should be avoided. 

Using the third M.2 port will cause SATA ports 5&6 to be disabled. Additionally, this M.2 port shares PCIe3 bandwidth with other devices in your system (i.e. networking, sound card, etc). 

SO - to answer the question. If you're using the secondary M.2 port, the M.2 itself will run at full speed, but the graphics card may not. 

If you're using the third M.2 port, it has to share its bandwidth with the rest of the machine, so there *MAY* (emphasis: **MAY**) be a slight decline in speed in situations where the chipset uplink gets clogged (though this is pretty unlikely). 

The proximity to the CPU itself has nothing to do with it, but the primary M.2 port is the one you would want to use because it's the one that has its own dedicated lanes.

But all that said, if you move it, the chances of you noticing *ANY* difference is pretty remote.",2

1: if one slot is faster than the other (newer PCIe gen version)

1icz0fl,does it matter what slot i put  my m.2,chisio1102,OGigachaod,"Only reason that would matter is if you were using your chipset bandwidth (USB/SATA) on something else, since the one near the CPU has direct access, otherwise it makes no difference.",1
1icz0fl,does it matter what slot i put  my m.2,chisio1102,ecktt,"The slot closest to the CPU talks directly to the CPU.

The further away ports normally operate off the south bridge which means it is shared bandwidth which could possibly be slower.

However there are few interesting things that make me thing that is not the case.

    When the M.2_2 is occupied by M.2 device, PCIe x16_1 will run at x8 mode.
    PCIe x16_3 slot shares bandwidth with PCIe x1_2 and PCIe x1_3.

    2 x PCIe 3.0/2.0 x16 (x16 or x8/x4)

1icyzb3,What Ram can I run?,International_Gur566,_Rusty_Axe,"MT/s is twice MHz.  DDR = dual data rate, so you get 2 memory reads per clock cycle.  So if the memory is running at 1600 Mhz, that is 3200 MT/s.  If you are getting 2667 MT/s, your memory is running at 1333 MHz.

You actually see MT/s all the time - that is generally what memory speeds are advertised at.  DDR5-6000 is 6000 MT/s with a 3000 MHz clock speed.

You would need to go into your BIOS and enable XMP to get the 3200 speed.

They use 1080p (often with a GPU that isn't useful for 1080p gaming) to force the limitation on the CPU to get results that are CPU limited. So the way i'd look at it is if you upgrade your GPU later on with the CPU you end up buying, it can give you an increase in performance, but only up to the point you become CPU limited.

Unless you're planning on going with a HFR (120hz+) monitor in your near future before you'd upgrade past AM4, I would stick with the 5600G and see if its enough. used CPUs tend to get pretty cheap if they're not among the best in their socket.

1icyqcg,are ASUS motherboards still a bad pick or have they improved?,Silveriovski,psimwork,"Ok. A few things. First, assuming you're referring to the CPU burning issues, the issue you're referring to wasn't just Asus. It was all of them, because AMD wasn't conservative enough with the maximum voltages for the 7800X3D, and motherboard manufacturers thought AMD WAS being conservative, so they allowed even more voltage to flow into the CPU from there. In fairness, Asus was the worst for this particular issue because they allowed the most over-voltage to flow, and their response to the problem was BY FAR the worst of any manufacturer.  But literally all motherboard manufacturers got SOME of this problem. But Asus' poor public response is why this is commonly referred to as the ""Asus burning CPU issue"", and that drives me slightly nuts - Asus deserves a fair amount of shit for the way they handle their RMAs. But they don't really deserve to be thought of as the primary driver for this particular problem. 

Background aside, this hasn't been a thing for like almost two years. And even then, it was a pretty short thing when it was an issue. And even then, it was only an issue for X3D CPUs. 

Just be sure to update your BIOS after you get everything up-and-running and you'll be fine. This really isn't critical - even if you have an X3D CPU, the likelihood that the BIOS hasn't been updated to fix the over-voltage is pretty low. And even in the (extremely) unlikely event that you got a motherboard with a BIOS that is over two years old, and you have an X3D CPU, it's not an issue for initial powerup and setup. There is no need to do it via BIOS flashback. 

Just make sure that a BIOS update is the first thing you do when you get to the BIOS screen, and you'll be fine.",0

Step 2 - Blame the customer themselves for improper installation or operation. If improper installation or operation *cannot* be at fault, proceed to step 3.

\* 3600 MT/s, they run at 1800 MHz. Timing is more than just the transfer rate though, the spec probably lists a timing profile like 18-22-22-42 or similar.

What are the *exact* DIMMs you have and what are you looking at buying? Full specs...

>I am not sure what single rank and dual rank mean, if you could please clarify.

DIMMs are physically arranged into either single-rank or dual-rank. it's how the actual memory chips are connected to something called a chip select line. Having more ranks per channel improves performance by allowing something called interleaving, but the more ranks you have the harder it is to run the memory.

Ranks should be in the specifications for the module, but some manufacturers don't specify it and have multiple SKUs under one type of kit. Corsair are notorious for this with their LPX kits... The specs printed on a module sometimes list the ranks like 2r8 (dual rank) or 1r8. CPUz will tell you how many ranks each DIMM has for DDR4.

With Ryzen 5000, two ranks per channel (so two single-rank DIMMs per channel) pretty much always works at 3600 MT/s provided the sticks have compatible XMP profiles. Three ranks per channel works more often than not, four ranks per channel is much harder to run.",1

1icxqj5,Power supply help,Bubs1819_,GeraltForOverwatch,"> Does my CPU also use PCIe?

It does not.

CPU takes its power from the motherboard. The motherboard takes its power from 24 pin ATX cable (the thick one) and EPS cable (4 ou 8 pin).

>If so should I fill both power spots on my Motherboard as I have the 7800x3d

It's not absolutely necessary. The second CPU power cable (aka EPS) is usually not needed unless you're gonna be a hardcore overclocker.

>I have the WD_Black that doesn’t use Sata correct?

WD_Black could be a bunch of stuff, not sure which one you mean.

Rule of thumb is: If it goes in a M.2 slot, it does not use SATA.

If SSD/HDD screws in the case frame, it uses a SATA power.",1

Just so we're clear, CPU power cable is not PCI-E. They can both be 8 pin but they are not interchangeable and dont fit the same slot.

Also, for the GPU, you need 2 separate *cables*, even if one cable has 2x PCI-E plugs in them, you still need to use 2 different cables (to split the power between them).

4080 super or even the 4070 ti super could be decent if you can find them near retail pricing.

1icwsgc,Is it worth upgrading to a 5080 from a 3080 10GB?,SporadicSpaceMan,DEZbiansUnite,I think benchmarks are showing you'll get a 70-something percent improvement so it's up to you whether that's worth the price tag or not. Nvidia is recommending you to use 850 W for a 5080 but you might be able to get away with a 750W,2
1icwsgc,Is it worth upgrading to a 5080 from a 3080 10GB?,SporadicSpaceMan,Minzoik,"750W seems like it's kind of close if you upgrade to the 5080 if you do a quick estimate. It might be alright if you have a good quality PSU. 

Doesn't hurt to at least try and see how it all behaves. You can always return it since you're buying it locally. It's a pretty significant upgrade in terms of performance, but it's also quite a chunk of money as well. 

Apart from that, have you updated your BIOS for the microcode updates for 14700K? Also, what are you temps like with the NHD-15S? Are you not thermal throttling at all?",1

What makes you believe it's at 4800mhz? What does it say if you check the memory tab in task manager performance monitor? 

Did simply enabling the EXPO profile for your ram not work? You shouldn't need to manually adjust any other settings, since the profile will automatically set frequency, timings and voltages. 

If you are enabling the profile and it doesn't seem to be sticking, it could be that the ram is not stable on the profile. In that case the system reverts to default ram settings when it fails to boot properly. 

A bios update may help with that. It's a good idea to update the bios anyway. I would start there and then re-enable expo and see if sticks.",2

A 9800X3D will likely smooth out  1 percent lows, but is unlikely to increase your overall fps much, so don't expect a night and day performance increase. You would need the GPU upgrade for that. 

9800X3D is still significantly overpriced due to low supply and high demand, though, and hard to even find in stock from legit retailers. Definitely don't buy one from sketchy amazon marketplace sellers or aliexpress. There have been reports of counterfeit lid swapped or faked CPUs, especially from aliexpress. 

Might be worth waiting until you can get a new GPU before upgrading at all.

1icvytm,Is 16gb vram still future proof for gaming? What games might struggle?,BoBoGaijin,SpoilerAlertHeDied,"It's actually hard to say. Hogwarts pushes 15 GB of VRAM usage at 1440p. No one has a crystal ball, but personally I went with higher VRAM (7900 XTX) and while I haven't yet run into a game that uses it all, it's been nice to play around with 20+ GB ML models while also having peace of mind that my VRAM is not going to be an issue for several generations.

There is a limiting factor with VRAM, in that if a game does require more than 16 GB, the majority of cards out there will struggle to run it. While people blame Nvidia for keeping VRAM low, on the flip side it at least forces developers to optimize a tiny bit so that lots of games will run. We probably won't see 16+ GB being common until most graphics cards offer that as an option.

If you think about it, this is part of the reason 32 GB on the 5090 makes zero sense for gaming. No one in the world is going to release a game that only the 5090 with 32 GB of VRAM can play. That 32 GB is only going to be used for ML and other non-gaming tasks.",0

While I generally agree, games these days for are simply requiring more. I play at 1440p 144hz and I've already ran into multiple games that needed more. 

Hogwarts legacy ran at literally half speed for me with 16gb no matter what settings I played on. Switched to 32gb and was instantly a smooth gaming experience. The game used 29-31gb at any given time. And this was a few years ago. 

I also play Escape from Tarkov which uses upwards of 29gb and that game has also been so much better since upgrading. 

Not saying these games were super optimized, but for 1440p gaming imo 32gb is kinda the standard now. With how close those kinds of games got me to the absolute limit I've since upgraded to 64gb to really future proof my setup. The cost/benefit was worth it for me and I reallly won't have to worry about anything for a long time.

The concern is that DLSS is the metaphorical lipstick on the pig to cover up the optimization devs should be doing, but I don't see that leaving a 5080 owner saying ""I literally can't play my games on my TV"". I'd expect any game running that poorly to outright flop for performance issues.",1

It is, but there are usually motherboards that offer the same for less, as ASUS TUF is quite a popular (and therefor overpriced) brand. ASRock generally has great value boards in many markets, as has MSI. Which country are you in, and do you need wifi/bluetooth?

> As for the GPU i think i'll stay with this one because it has ray-tracing.

A 4060 won't be fast enough for proper raytracing anyway, it's simply a slow card. AMD is pretty bad at raytracing technologically, but because AMD cards at the same price are much faster raytracing performance isn't that bad in most games.

1icuytk,How many of you reuse old parts when putting together a new build?,MyHonestViews,DevB1ker,"Something to consider about cases ...

Cases from 7 years ago tend to have limited support for AIOs at best. And most of those have challenges when using them. So if you are looking at using an AIO, you'll want to take that into consideration.

Additionally ... the newer cases will have lots of quality-of-life features that make building and cable management much easier as well as better airflow, which is going to be important for cooling the very hot components that we have these days. I recently did a similar task (upgrading the guts) for my nephews build in his old case ... fitting even a 240mm AIO was a challenge. Several months later, we swapped out the case and the new one was much, much easier when it came to ease of building. And easily supported a 360mm AIO.

As for PSUs ... it depends on the PSU, its wattage, its efficiency, and its warranty. If it has enough wattage and is still under warranty, definitely consider continuing to use it. There are PSUs out there with 10 year warranties.

Here we reccomed parts and sutch, but for a full build go to r/buildapcforme , or to there like ones about prebuilts. So unless you're willing to build it yourself this is not your sub.

No intent to intimidate you, may have sounded a bit rough. Have a nice day.",2
1icup3n,Buying my first PC,Succsqueeze497,JamesW14,"Yeah the 5700G is an APU so when they list ""AMD Radeon"" Graphics Card I'm guessing it's the on board GPU from the CPU. Meaning there is no actual physical graphics card in that PC and it won't run very well for most games.

Also the 5700G is AM4 socket which isn't necessarily bad but it will be outdated soon as AMD are no longer creating AM4 processors. Having said that your budget kind of restricts you to AM4.

Also I'd say 512gb storage isn't enough and I'd want 1tb which would do you well.

And 32gb ram would be much better than 16gb without a massive price difference.

Personally, with a budget of $1000 CAD there's not a great deal you could get new and I'd say if you're gonna buy a pre built just get a second hand one for this price. 

But honestly it's really not hard to build a PC yourself if you just use a youtube video. Pretty much all parts have the same process of installation so you wouldn't even need a video of somebody with your same parts.

If you are to build one, which would be best, I'd go something like a Ryzen 5 5600 with 32gb ram, and maybe something like an AMD RX 6600.

This build would probably be a bit more expensive than that prebuilt you found but 1 million percent better value and it would last longer.

Having said all that, and looking at the requirements for that one specific game, I guess the PC you found would work for it, but IMHO I would not be buying that ever.",2

It's mostly knowing what's in the market right now, building is easy, plus you can get help from the almighty Google or reddit for any issue.

But AFAIK r/buildapcforme is for full lists of components to assemble yourself. But might be nice info to compare a custom build and prebuilt, specially price to performance, custom basically destroys in all classes.

* 2TB of SSD for the same price as the 1TB you're looking at, Samsung is overpriced for non-professional workloads. 

* A quieter and beefier PSU for roughly the same price.

* A properly specced monitor, 1080p is both a chokepoint for your picked GPU _and_ is stupidly overpriced for what you're getting.",2

5700x3d is still widely available and its performance is very close to the 5800x3d. 

Unless you already have a pretty decent heatsink/AIO, then you should probably also upgrade that, as the x3d parts run hotter than their non-x3d versions.

RAM is fine.

Since you have your machine open - drop in a 2TB NVME drive. Games are big now.

If you could spring it, you'd squeeze more out of the 4090 going 7800x3d or 9800x3d on AM5, but that'll be a huge jump in cost.",2

If so a GPU would run the operation much faster and likely more efficiently if it could be leveraged.  If you are doing vector math operations or some of the already GPU enabled versions of MATLAB functions, perhaps its possible with some code rework.  Also, AVX512 extensions of new CPUs will help vector math operation, these are in the latest threadripper.  Best practice for cooling is just draw in cool air and push it out the back and monitor temperatures to keep them in the recommended range for your server.  Sounds silly but my point is I try to load something I know will run hot in the front racks where the coolest air can be drawn in and have a plan to beef up datacenter cooling in case you need to.  Last tid bit... you may want to test your work on cloud instances AMD, Intel, GPU, tinker with number of CPU cores vs. RAM, etc. to determine what works best before you commit to capitol investment.

If the times which your workload runs is flexible, cloud compute instances on demand can help save a lot of money but often monolithic apps are not going to be good candidate.  With private cloud instances its totally possible to keep your info very private and secure, even US gov't 3 letter agencies leverage the heck out of cloud, it just needs to be designed correctly.

1icucoz,"Is it worth upgrading from the 4090 to a 5090 for a Samsung odissey G9 57""?",Eliuz19,Eliuz19,"Maybe I explained myself poorly. The screen is a 240hz screen, but the 4090 is limited to 120hz because it doesn't have a display port 2.1. Buying a 5090 would unlock those 240hz thanks to the new port, therefore if I boot up an old game capable to do 240fps, I would actually use the screen at its maximum potential, while with the 4090 regardless of the game is limited at 50%.

  
The PSU is not a problem, I've got a 1200W, so I'm not worried about that. For what I've seen on benchmarks the 5090 seems 30% faster in raster in 4k, and considering that the screen is a dual 4k, probably that 30% could come in handy",1

I will likely sell it this summer and pickup a used 4090 or 5090 depending on upgrade cost but I'm waiting for 5090 to be more field tested, make sure its very solid, before I spend big on it.  Before that I had a 1080ti for about 4 years which was also a great GPU.  Initial reviewers are saying 5090 is overkill for any game out there and in the foreseeable future so its very much sounds like a 5+ year card.

I won’t debate the merits of a 4090 over a 5090 price wise because at the XX90 level you’re not super worried about the price. And in your case you do have a legitimate, hardware reason to upgrade.

What about having the fan run when the inverter runs?",1
1icu9nc,Looking for a Thermally Throttled Noctua Fan for Sailboat Electronics Cooling,canuckingeh,ZeroPaladn,"If the fan keeping you awake is a concern, you can pick up inline resistors for them to slow them down to the point where they'd be silent/effectively silent. 

And if you're worried about something being on 24/7, the circuitry to enable the kind of automatic adjustment would also be turned on all the time, introduce complexity in the form of an automatic monitoring and potentiometer system (probably a hobby board like a Raspberry Pi/Arduino), and would be prone to the same hazards that an always running fan would.

A physical switch to turn it on/off would be the _most_ I would complicate the circuit in this setup, and simply find a speed that is quiet enough to not be a bother at night.",1

Typically in a PC, you use the 4th PWM pin to regulate speed. 

However, you can still regulate any fan by regulating voltage, aka 6V is half speed.

1ict5kt,Is it okay to put 8gb(2) and 16gb(2) RAM (same brand),Realistic_Table_2871,Havarem,"Good questions! First it depends on the platform. I don’t know if it changed but when the AMD 7000 platform came out, using all 4 DIMM meant a significant reduction in data transfer rates - something like from 6000 to 3600. But sometimes you don’t really care about transfer rates and only need to handle large file or running multiple virtual machines. As far as I know intel didn’t had that limitation.

My intuition here is it to make sure each pair have their own “channel” (usually using alternating slots) and you the system will probably use the worst timing of the two sets. If you have time just test with a memory test - sometimes available directly in the bios - and analyze your needs : if you are going for gaming, 2x16 is probably enough.

While I'm not thrilled with a $1200 graphics card only having 16GB of VRAM, the build itself should run just about anything 4k 60fps+ at high/ultra settings. That's why I went with AMD and the 7950x3d + 7900xtx (24gb VRAM) this gen.

1icsi0e,Just a mum here trying to upgrade an Acer aspire GX-781 for my son.,LornaOk91,zelyre,"I think the games that he plays can help steer us with what upgrades you should look at first. 

With that said, I looked up the full specs on that PC.

With just a 128GB SSD, no games will fit on there. There's a 1TB HDD, but these drives are very slow.

Once consoles started coming out with SSDs by default, game development moved to assuming they're going to get that type of performance. A lot of modern games will choke trying to run off a hard drive.

You also mentioned a new PC for Christmas. So, let's look at upgrades that we can carry over to the new PC.

A 1TB SSD is pretty cost effective. There are two types. An NVME SSD - this looks like a stick of gum. And a SATA SSD. This is a 2.5"" little box, like half a stack of playing cards in size. The NVME drive is significantly faster, whereas the SATA SSD is old tech, but still much faster than a HDD.

I looked up the motherboard on this PC and it looks like there's just 1 NVME slot on this PC. It's in the upper right corner, next to the big bundle of cables (power). If it has something in there now, we can rule out using an NVME SSD, as this most likely has the operating system and will require additional steps and hardware to swap out. If it's empty, then it's free game. 

If that NVME slot is in use, if you look at the lower right corner of the motherboard, there's a metal plate. Inbetween that plate and the giant cable attached to the motherboard are two black plugs with an L inside them. These are SATA ports. One might be in use by a hard drive - it'll have a flat cable. You could add another SATA SSD and this upgrade could also move on to the new future PC.

This is probably the best glow-up you can give this PC.

For under $20, add another 1x 8GB stick of DDR4 ram. There are two physical types - one is for laptop and the other for desktop, so make sure you get one for desktop. In a perfect world, it's best to pair these as kits and get the same speed/brand. But eh. Not worth it for this use case.

And, without knowing what the plans are for future PC, that's as far as I'd go. A new graphics card would do wonders, but I don't see much point in getting one now if future PC one may have one that's much better.",3
1icsi0e,Just a mum here trying to upgrade an Acer aspire GX-781 for my son.,LornaOk91,TiredOldGrunt412,"Like Deadpool said, upgrade the Ram.

Unless your son is running heavy CPU tasks, the memory will really make a big difference.

  
After that, do a deep dive into the registry and clean out all the garbage left behind by deleted programs and stuff that isn't being used, but still takes up system memory.",3

It's ddr4 ram from a quick Google search. Make sure to put the ram sticks in the correct slots, as some/all? Motherboards have slots that they prefer.

If the rest of your components are more power-hungry than normal then you need more, but otherwise 650 watts is enough. If you have a less power-hungry CPU, you might even be okay with less than 650.

Of course, you can get as much more than that as you want. This is just the minimum recommended.

>I've heard you should get a PSU that is 1.5x what you expect

The ""what you expect"" there is actual full load power consumption. What pcpartpicker tells you is a theoretical maximum and a rough estimate. For example, see here some of Techspot's total system consumption measurements while gaming: [https://www.techspot.com/review/2793-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super/#Power\_Consumption](https://www.techspot.com/review/2793-nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-ti-super/#Power_Consumption)",2

If you wanna go for a b450 rather look at the MSI variants as most of them do support Bios Flashback.

I personally prefer the a520 lineup, as they do offer full pci-e 3.0 on the entire board. Fav one would be the gigabyte a520I AC Itx board. Got a solid VRM, 2 HDMI and 1 DP output. ASUS TUF GAMING A520M-PLUS (WIFI) would be my second choice. If you still want to keep some more support, MSI B550M Pro-VDH (wifi)

These boards are not exactly the cheapest but you will get the most for your money, at least from my perspective.

You will need more ram and honestly, I would rather go 32GB, as you share the memory with the IGPU. Ram speed should be 3600mhz as you will benefit from it in IGPU performance.

I am running non IGPU builds with either PICO modules 160 / 200 W or with an FSP 200W SFX power supply ( got those cheap and work fine for office). Highest I got was roughly 120W on total consumption pushing that thing to it's limit.",1

1icrw4j,Need suggestion for my Budget build AMD 5600G,lightyagami_01,B3nto-san,"Bios refers to a file that is and needs to be installed onto the motherboard itself to be able to use the newer processor. To update the Bios, you will need either have access to the bios while booting or a feature that is called bios flashback, a button to use an USB drive with the file, to update it.

This can be a hideous process, so rather go with a newer board that already supports it.

Older boards usually need a supported processor installed to get access to the bios. 

Many older boards don't have that button, which is why I said look for a MSI motherboard, if you want to go the bios update route on B450.

A520 refers to the chipset used on the MB, which is newer than the B450 and most likely will support the 5600g out of the box.

Other than that, you would be looking a passive cooled VRM (Voltage Regulator Module) that also uses a higher quality.

2 Years after built i had problems with 1 RAM Stick it was faulty. Found it with Memtest86

3 Years after built i had another problem. Normally my Mainboard setting was 1,36v VRAM

Sticks have 1,35v it was fine with 2 Sticks and with 4 Sticks bluescreens

After upping the VRAM voltage to 1,38 in the bios it worked fine since now \^\^

i built that System 2020

i9 9900k

RTX2070Super changed that last year to a RTX4070TI",1

I'd recommend you get another CPU, at least to test it out. This CPU has a separate I/O interface and it sometimes dies without affecting the main cores right away... or something like that.

You can go back on my post history and check this out, I had a similar issue some months ago and someone explained it perfectly. I can't post the link here because of dumb rules.

While I usually don't advocate going AIO over aircooling, in such an aquarium style case which are really mostly built for AIOs I would just get a 360mm RGB aircooler, since that's actually cheaper than getting that Thermalright PS 120SE + 3 Arctic RGB fans.

The RGB RAM of that same kit is also cheaper, so I'd get that.

Lastly, since you are going to RGB, bear in mind that the bottom and side should be intake, so with those arctic fans you will be looking at the back of the frame. There are reverse blaade fans for that purpose, but they are a bit more expensive. Thermaltake sells a 3-pack.

You can also save some money on board, NVME and I did select a cheaper PSU, but you don't seem to be going for value. Nothing wrong with the components themselves.

1icqz4c,"Feeling the urge to upgrade my PC, though I'm not sure what it would benefit from most – what would YOU upgrade?",TheFlyingBogey,kociol21,"DDR4 RAM is dirt cheap right now, and you could probably just get another 2x8GB of same model for pennies, to upgrade to 32 GB, unless your motherboard has only 2 RAM slots?

Otherwise - definitely GPU. Your CPU is still more than fine, unless you do professional workflows requiring some beefy CPUs. 1080 Ti is still not bad by any means, but it's the first part of your setup to become obsolete, as more and more games will require ray-tracing capabilities. For now there is only one notable game I think - Indiana Jones, but there is also new Doom announced and basically over the time this will be the trend. 

To upgrade CPU you'd have to upgrade motherboard and RAM too, so it would be big switch without really notable performance changes in gaming. 

If you want to upgrade anyway in 2 years and you desperately want to do something now, there is no point of upgrading something other than GPU now for like 4070 Super or something. But if you are willing to wait 2 months - there will be 5070 out and new AMD cards, so we will have a bigger picture.",2

Idk. if it's good to wait for the new 5070 or 9070XT from iNvidia/AMD. If you're on a budget and you can find a B580 for close to MSRP($250) I believe it will be a good upgrade, but I guess if you want future proofing for 1080p at least and don't mind spending $400-ish something like a 7800XT or even 7700XT(which I have) should serve you. Im writing that with a somewhat assumption that you're in the US, if you're in Europe like me prepare to pay more than you'd see on smth like microcenter or newegg. VAT is a bi\*\*.

Oh and the RAM thing; I've had it drummed into me by other PC builders that 4x slots is worse than just replacing the 2x slots because quad channel is ""way worse"" than dual channel, but I'd much rather just slap in another 2x8GB if those claims are overstated.",1

And I should've clarified, I'm in the UK so yeah.. I feel that on the prices 🥲

Most ""normal"" - consumer level main boards indeed don't have quad-channel support. But the number of sticks is not the same as number of channels. You can run two sticks as dual channel on dual channel board (which is most boards nowadays). You also can run 4 sticks as dual channel - it will just mean that you have 2 sticks per channel. Quad-channel would be running 4 sticks - each as separate channel - but again - quad-channel is mostly found in high end boards and mainly boards designed for server usage.

So in your case, whether you use 4 sticks or 2 sticks, it will be mostly irrelevant because it will run in dual channel either way. Just make sure that new RAM is similar to your current RAM - speed, latency etc. The best is to buy same sticks as you already have.",1

I don’t think you’ll be getting high or ultra on new games. Especially new games as they are far more gpu/cpu heavy. I can’t even play POE2 on my pc. It really sucks :(

40 series is a way better goal, 30 series might be serviceable. Rx 6600xt should be fine too. 6700xt/6750xt if you can find them at a reasonable price are ideal. Any card below 12gb vram is gonna be really rough soon enough",3

I had a 2060 when I played on 1080p Then i upgrade to 1440p and had to get a 3060 ti. Now I have a 4k monitor and a 4090 which can only push about 60-90fps on the most demanding games.",2
1icql1n,RTX 2060 in 2025,Good_Leadership_4900,Elc1247,"for some context, the 2060 is an entry level card from 3 generations ago now. It was already anemic before the PS5 generation of consoles was released, so you really need to temper your expectations.

a 2060 is a 1080p 60FPS type of card, you will likely need to crank down the settings to get a decent framerate that is stable.

so for more context, the rough GPU equivalent to a base PS5 is the AMD 6700. Using average Timespy benchmark scores, we can get a rough idea of how the cards compare in non-raytraced games.

6700 has an average score of about 10600

2060 has an average score of about 7400

That means the base PS5 is roughly 40% more powerful than the 2060.

Most games on the PS5 use what is listed as the ""Medium"" option for their graphics settings when compared to the PC settings.

1icpzfp,"Help,  I need a new gaming pc in 2025",PikaPog,WaggishSaucer62,"Yep that's good info, there's a lot of strange things about that pc, the ram issue is probably best fixed by reinstalling windows, you probably have a lot of bloatware installed.

Not having an ssd as the boot drive in 2025 is a crime, hdds aren't much cheaper except for much larger capacities these days anyway.

A i7-9700k is ok, but its not amazing these days.

A 2070 super is not the same thing as a 3070 super, a 2070 super is somewhat powerful, but it's getting a bit old, I wouldn't expect much more than med-low 1080p \~75fps in modern games with that. But the tech is off their rocker recommending an Intel Arc 770 as an upgrade, it's less powerful, and if that was within the last month or two outdated since intel released a new and much better generation.

The 2070 only running at 2.5GT/s is strange, the only way to get 2.5gt/s would be if you are running on pcie 2 which you shouldn't be, since your hardware is capable of pcie 3 (unless your motherboard isn't?), but since they mentioned the max speed was 8gt/s which is the max speed for pcie 2 it might be. Either way, if it is 2.5gb/s that is definitely slow, a modern card can use up to 32gt/s, and the 50 series will be able to do 64.

I would try reseating the GPU to see if you can get it to connect at a higher bandwidth, since that is likely the main cause of any underperforming. If that doesn't work, I would also try it in a another pcie slot if you have one. I would also get an anti sag bracket if that fixes it to prevent it in the future.

I have no experience with that, but looks to be really ram heavy from a quick search. If that's your main game then it might be worthwhile to go with 64gb.

Hard to say how availability and stock will be. It'll probably be better than the 5090 launch if i had to guess.

My original budget was around $2400 but that was fairly flexible, as this is my first time even owning a pc, so I'm still not even really sure what my budget *should* be, and I don't want to buy something that won't last, or isn't capable of what I need for a good experience. 

I do apologise for leaving out information! Wasn't trying to hide anything, this is just my first time and I really don't know what I'm doing. Absolutely will include it in the future",1

1icpnqb,Is this build ok? First time,BlazedToddler420,Hiadro,"No worries! 

I gotta admit, it's hard to definitively recommend one CPU over another, since the 7600(non x) is a pretty good performance for the cost, and I am confident you'd be happy with it. 

That said though, the x version has a slightly higher boost clock by default (gives approx. 5-7% higher performance on average as far as I can tell), and the x3D versions even higher than that again (for gaming that is - the x3D versions excels at single threaded gaming, but perform slightly worse typically for multi threading). 

Sidenote: typically the x versions of the CPUs don't come with a cooler, so be aware. I'd recommend a Thermalright Phantom Spirit anyway. 

If I were you, I'd definitely look up benchmarks for different CPUs in the games you play (youtube is great for this), that should help you decide. 

Apart from that it depends on how much you would be willing to put into it right now, or if you're thinking of upgrading in the near ish future. 

I have a 7700x that I've undervolted slightly, which performs about 10-20% better than the regular 7600 in most benchmarks I've seen - which for me is absolutely worth the slightly higher cost.",1

Good mobo pick, don't see any problems with it.

I assume that ram is 2x16gb? That means you could upgrade to 64gb in the future with another set of matching sticks if needed.

You didn't say what speed your ram was, but ddr5 can go up to 9600mt/s, but it is incredibly expensive for comparatively little performance increase. You can get 7800 or 7200 for way less.

For cpu cooler, the 9800x3d is a powerful chip, so you will need either a nice dual stack dual fan air cooler, or at least a 240mm watercooler.",1

Liquid coolers are more expensive, introduce more points of failure, and are rarely actually any quieter than an air cooler.

1icp0ee,New PC black screen,ElSensualXD,Potential_Copy27,"How did you install the RAM?

I had the same problem when building my 9600x-based system (did more or less the same upgrade you did). I had the same problem getting my Gigabyte B650 mobo booting. I got a light indicating a DRAM error.

Turns out, if you have 2 sticks of RAM, you have to install them in the 2nd and 4th slot outward from the CPU - not the 1st and 3rd as on the vast majority of board I've worked on since DDR1 first came out :-). This applies to your board as well, according to the manual.

If that doesn't help - Do a minimum viable configuration (CPU installed, 1 stick of RAM (in DIMM\_A2!), monitor hooked to the onboard GPU.  
Add parts one by one until you can't boot anymore

If the minimum config doesn't work, you can attempt to restore/update the BIOS with the Flashback feature - howto is described in the manual and [here](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1038568/)

In addition, the board has some fan control bugs - they should be fixed in the v3067 BIOS. In any case, you should update to that version, as there are some performance improvements to be had as well...

By the way:  
Neither you nor the store actually has any way to know which BIOS is installed unless the board is booted up first, so updating the BIOS for that reason is still viable.

The board *does* run with a 9000, but only if the installed BIOS is new enough... It doesn't mean the board is updated from the store...",2

If the PSU is fine but other parts are not working:  
Dismantle your computer and install what you used to use. Then, add the new parts one by one (e.g. if you bought a new GPU, remove the old one and then install the new GPU) until it's not working - it means that part has some problem. Contact with customer service.

If the fans and PSU are working:  
1. Did you turn on your monitor? Check the cable and sockets  
2. Make sure that you plug the video cable into the GPU instead of the motherboard

It’s more common to run into this issue if you’ve got 10GbE networking on the motherboard, but that’s not very common.

1ico2r1,Is there a point upgrading to 9800X3D if I can get 5800X3D?,Eleonoraa_,IncredibleGonzo,"Oversimplify incoming, but hopefully gets the basic idea across:

 The reason the difference between the two CPUs would be more significant with higher-end GPUs or lower resolution is because, essentially, in any given game, a CPU has a maximum framerate it can do. This varies based on what’s happening in the game but for the most part, the elements that depend on the CPU aren’t as easy to scale up and down as the GPU-dependent stuff.

Whereas the GPU is much more tweakable - higher resolution, higher textures, post-processing effects, etc.

As long as the GPU’s max output at the settings and resolution you use is lower than what the 5800X3D can manage, you won’t see much difference between it and a faster CPU.

So say in a game the 5800X3D can manage 90fps, the 9800X3D can do 130, the 3080 can do 80, and the 5080 can do 120 (all totally made up numbers, not based on real performance). The 5800X3D and 3080 together will get 80fps, and upgrading to the 9800X3D wouldn’t do much. But the 5080 would get 90fps with the 5800X3D, and be able to do its full 120 with the 9800X3D.

And similarly, in the same game the 3080 might be able to manage, say, 110fps if you lowered the resolution, so in that case you’d also see a difference between the two CPUs.

Right now I've really only tested Tarkov (which is why I bought it) and PoE2. My high FPS isn't much higher.... maybe 30%... but the 1% lows are where it feels the best. I don't get stuttering anymore in either game which was well worth the money to me.

I'm also finally able to run Rimworld and Kenshi without any performance hits or lag spikes (each game having over 200 mods installed). You'll generally see large gains in simulation and strategy games where everything is CPU bound. Not so much framerate, but just overall performance, turn timers, and a vast reduction in frame drops and stuttering.",1

* 5800X 3D is no longer being produced, they do less QC and make it into 5700X 3D
* Zen 3 X 3D chip is slower than 12th Gen with modern DDR5 6400 Mhz in Modern title, This is due to memory bandwidth DDR5 offer, **This advantages** is not a thing if you play solely **esport/older game**
* Zen 4 3D, Zen 5 3D got faster core and DDR5 which make it far faster even beating 14th Gen, Which is very fast

if you have 5600X I see no much reason to upgrade other than FPS bump on today games, The moment CPU because extremely problematic, 5700X 3D will not help much, because it's usually not cache bottleneck but the game are pushing much harder on the CPU.",1

In games like Star Citizen, Remnant 2, Dying Light 2 and a few others I saw around a 20FPS jump @2k. The Remnant 2 N'erud level went from a 25FPS slideshow without FSR (~35FPS with FSR) to ~55FPS native resolution going with the X3D part. Star Citizen's city Orison went from ~30FPS to ~50FPS back in 3.17/3.18 patch. 
All of my other games not mentioned here at least saw smoother, more consistent fps numbers and a reduction in stuttering.

Just to let you know you will get the same performance out of a 5700X3D as well. Many of the games i listed I tested initially with an older BIOS version that supported the X3D but kept it at 3.4ghz max.

GPUs tend to be the most important thing for game performance, until the day that your CPU is holding you back. When your CPU is starting to give you problems, it'll usually present as really bad 1% lows, freezes, and hang ups. Depending on the game, you might see almost no performance increases by upgrading your CPU, and other games might benefit greatly. It's really hard to say without any examples. If you think your CPU is starting to show it's age, then going with like 9800X3D would be a better upgrade for you. But if you're more worried about running cyberpunk on ultra settings at a higher framerate than 50-60 frames and maybe flipping on RT, then perhaps you should consider 5080 while going to a 5700x3d if you think a little more juice on your CPU would help too.

Anyways I dunno. I probably wouldn't do such a miniscule upgrade to your CPU. It'll be a little boost, but you'll probably be underwhelmed. Maybe just look into trying out overclocking?",1

Ordered a 5700x3d off Amazon. Third party seller, paid 250 plus taxes for it.

Third party seller still hasn't shipped it when I made the order on Thursday. So before I cancel that order I have Amazon putting in a release ticket to at least show that the seller has shipped the damn CPU.

The kicker? I also bought a 4070 (which has arrived and is an amazing upgrade over my old 5700xt). But for the CPU, GPU, CPU cooler and my new NAS 10tb drive I reloaded my Amazon gift balance to be the full cost of the purchase.

So if I do cancel the order from the third party seller who needs to ship the CPU. That balance would then go back as a gift card balance. Then I need to get that refunded back to my debit card I used for the purchase.

I'm pushing back on the assertion that your 4080 Super is able to ""keep up"" paired with a 5700x3d.   It's should have come with a qualifier.  If it's good enough for you great, but like I said, depending on what you're playing you could be leaving way more than 10% performance on the table.


That being said if you have access to a microcenter the bundle deals make it quite affordable to switch to AM5.  You don't have to piece it together which makes it more expensive. ",1

1icnyy1,"Fractal North XL, Can it fit two 360MM at the same time?",Difficult-Wasabi-988,aminy23,"GPU definitely at the top. 

First the GPU is 600 watts, so it's best to exhaust that heat straight out the case versus toasting every other PC part. 

Second top mount is ideal for AIOs because it enhances the lifespan because the pump is under the liquid. If the pump is over the liquid, then there's a chance the pump can run dry and fail. 

It's better to have a $2,000+ graphics card survive longer than a $200 AIO. 

Bottom AIO is the worst, and front mount is ok. 

The front AIO should ideally have the tubes on the bottom, but tubes are the top still works but might be a little louder. 

I don't recommend the 9950X here unless you have a very specific use case like VMs.

But the 7600 is the entry level AM5 CPU, and the worst CPU in its price class. 

It's hardly a top tier when nearly ever other Ryzen 7000/9000 CPU beats it. 

On AM5, the 9600 is about to beat it for a similar price: 
https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-5-9600.html

The benefit of the 7600 is it's upgrade potential, it can be upgraded to 1-2 newer generations of CPU. On the other hand, we could say the same about Arrow Lake Intel Ultra 200. 

In reality it's a layaway plan, you pay about $400 now, and then you can pay another $400-$500 later to upgrade to an 8-12 core CPU like a 9800X3D or future Zen 6. 

If we use parametric filters for the cheapest 32GB RAM with decent latency (10ns first word) and cheapest ATX motherboard. 

AM5's requirement for DDR5 makes it expensive, along with having very expensive motherboards. 

The 7600's performance is at best competitive with the 5700X3D. 

On the Intel side, a 12 core 12700KF can compete with a 7700X while costing less than a 7600. It ends up much cheaper overall, and even if you use DDR5, it will still come out cheaper.

#Middle Ground

The price can be brought down further with an i5-12400F or i5-12600KF. If you case supports ATX, the H670 PG Riptide is only $5 more. 

For a higher end build you can use the ATX H670 Steel Legend for $10 more with an Intel 14th Gen i5/i7, and the latest BIOS should be installed ASAP if using one of those CPUs.

Your running a system with a 12 year old cpu that is a quad core without multi-threading, on a DDR3 platform. This is what you should be looking to upgrade - hopefully the power supply isn't that old either.

Then, once you have a system that can actually perform ok at 1080p, I'd say you can go ahead and buy silly things like a water cooler without being totally crazy (still pointless but if it makes you happy then it makes you happy).

And just so this makes some sense;

CPU/platform upgrade comes first because as you pointed out, the cpu you have is so slow it's holding back even an RX 570 - to get full performance from it, you need a better cpu. Because your system is so old, you also need a motherboard, ram and a cooler for the cpu upgrade. 

Next comes upgrading the gpu because you have a cpu that can handle it, so a good budget option that performs well for the money such as the 6650XT is a good idea, but I'd imagine the power supply in your system is as old and bad as that cpu, so upgrading that to a well made budget optoin is important so you don't have an IED sitting on your desk. Along with that, upgrading the storage from what I assume you have is a HDD to a quick NVME SSD makes the entire system run wayyy faster and smoother, and makes the pc feel like it belongs in 2025.",1
1icnnow,upgrade for an i5 4570?,Large-Ladder-8045,aminy23,"Yes, all of them support Windows 11. A 5600 or i5-12400F is a much better CPU for a little more money. 

With Intel you also get a much better motherboard and the ability to upgrade further without having to replace the motherboard and RAM a second time. 

Even an i3-12100F is a solid upgrade from it: 
https://youtu.be/JPPeSNV9Hog

Though the i3 brand has a lot of stigma from old models which were low performance, a new i3 can outperform most i7 CPUs. The main weakness of the 5500 comes from the weak single thread performance which tanks gaming performance:

There's a benchmark button on the top left, press that, if it can complete a full pass, thats a good sign. I would keep the preset on extreme and then use the monitors max resolution, actually on second thought, 1440p is probably enough if its a 4k display.

Ideally, you would want to run a full suite of tests, but you probably don't want to spend all day at the seller's house or vice versa so yeah, that should do.

Don't forget to keep an eye on temperature in the right hand corner under all the other stats. 80c isn't that unusual under heavy load, though 90c+ could indicate a cooling problem. Cooling problems can be solved though, maybe all you need is an undervolt and new fan curve both are really easy.

1icn0m8,AM5 jump or Stick to AM4 with new GPU's.,NarmakRawwaz,dweller_12,"5700X3D is pretty good. I just sold my 5800X3D for more than I bought it for new. I picked out 8700F, B650 board, and 32GB DDR5 for under $300. At 1440p 165Hz the CPU bound games I usually play still hit 300+ FPS. The overall performance is basically identical to the AM4/DDR4 setup, I forget I even changed anything. I would have never expected to make money from a CPU upgrade.

AM4 is still extremely relevant for high end gaming, and 5700X3D is the chip you need for any sort of high refresh gaming when upgrading an older motherboard.",2

1icn0m8,AM5 jump or Stick to AM4 with new GPU's.,NarmakRawwaz,definitlyitsbutter,"The higher the resolution, the more load goes to gpu and less to the cpu. I remeber tests of 9800x3d that showed no real difference to a 5800x3d in 4k, as the gpu is such a big bottleneck. There were not many tests in that resolution, as most tests want the cpu to be the bottleneck for comparison.



My advice: if you play gpu heavy games in 4k, send that stuff back, get a 5700x3d and wait for am6.

So, just evaluate the B850 and X870 boards for the features you want/need and price level you're OK with.

Choose x870 for the following reasons:

* Major overclocking (larger VRMs)
* More M.2 drives that are at least 4x4
* USB4 in all x870 boards
* More fast USB ports
* Debug codes in more models (largely for memory/CPU overclockers)
* 5G and above networking more common
* All have Wi-Fi 7

If several of these are not absolute requirements, then shop in the B850 boards for the price/feature tradeoff you want and you can find some of the above features in the B850 boards also.

1icmjvc,First time build (Halp),SantoGeorge,etnlnight,"I’d be a little concerned with the 750W gold power supply. I know that part picker is estimating a 600-650 watt load, but I’m not so sure. Newegg was thinking a bit more power. With all the money being dumped into the 4080 and 7800x3d might not be a bad idea to get a bit more power or aim for a platinum or titanium rated supply. It’s always a bit sketchy getting a PSU that’s already near the max capacity for a system. Just a suggestion.

I’d also consider a 360mm just to ensure that you’re getting all the heat away from your x3d to maximize CPU performance. You should be able to mount the 360mm on the front panel and get some exhaust on the top and rear to pull air through.

Another more premium thing that I invested in on my last build was braided ATX cables for your modular power supply. Yeah they cost a bit more money, but they route a bit better and stay really clean for cable routing (especially with the combs to keep them organized). Looks REALLY nice afterwards, as well.

Lastly, any thermal paste? Thermal Grizzly Duronaut or Arctic MX-6 are definitely better thermal interface solutions than whatever comes on the AIO.

Happy building!",2

If you go to page 7 of your manual (1.3 Motherboard Layout), you can see their locations on your motherboard. The M2\_1 slot (best slot) fully supports PCIe 4.0x4 speeds and the M2\_2 slot supports PCIe 3.0x2. If they aren't populated, I would highly recommend purchasing an NVMe SSD. They are the easiest to install and the fastest drives on the market right now. Do note, the M2\_2 slot (in the bottom right corner) would max out at roughly 2000 MB/s speeds so if you get a faster drive and place it there, don't worry about the speeds being lower than what they should be (2000 MB/s is more than enough for games anyways). On the other hand, the M2\_1 slot would fully support the speeds of whatever NVMe Gen 4.0 drive you put into it.   
  
There are definitely videos on the internet that would show you how to install an NVMe drive as well. The process is way easier than installing a 2.5 inch SATA SSD.   
  
On a different note, I would also recommend making the M2\_1 drive your boot drive if it isn't already. You should see much faster boot times if you do (especially if you have an HDD as a boot drive)! There are a lot of tutorials on the internet to do that as well, the easiest method would be is to make a USB installer with the Windows media creation tool. Although if you're doing that for the first time, I'd recommend disconnecting every other drive than the one that you'd want to make a boot drive as it would be pretty easy to format a drive and wipe it for a beginner (data recovery would be a pain if you do).

I currently run a pair of 1TB 990 Pros in RAID 1 (AM5 platform, 9900x with an x870e) for my OS, and I only see fractionally above sequential CrystalDiskMark benchmarks on the Internet for it (sequential read benchmarks put one drive at 7,152 MB/s, I see 7,100 MB/s to 7,300 MB/s). If I compare to a single 4TB 990 Pro in the same system, I see a sequential read of 6,900 MB/s. So there is a definite improvement, but not double. [Here's a side-by-side of a benchmark on the RAID array (left) and the single 4TB drive (right)](https://imgur.com/a/2yyCLhJ). These were just random runs, not cherry picked or rerun multiple times.

I saw more of a read performance increase on my old build (5900x, x570) that used 512GB Gen 3 SSDs, but one of these 990 Pros out performs that notably. I also run a pair of 2TB MX500 drives in RAID 1, and those basically see a doubling (560 MB/s for a single drive to 1060 MB/s for a pair).

  
So why are the results like that? On consumer platforms it's because the RAID is software RAID with the CPU handling the calculations, and when you are at Gen 4 speeds, that's a lot of overhead. An enterprise RAID controller ([like this](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/highpoint-ssd7105-4x-m2-nvme-raid-controller-2242-2260-2280-22110-pcie-30-x16-single-raid-0-1-10-win)) *may* give better performance, but you have to deal with the lanes you need for it. Remember that SSDs are already essentially a RAID array in and of themselves - the multiple flash chips are used in parallel to improve read/write speeds typically.

When running on a consumer platform, you also have where the lanes are coming from to contend with - for a typical AMD platform, you normally have 4 lanes from the CPU dedicated to an SSD. Any other CPU lanes that could be used for an SSD then typically drop the graphics card slot to 8x. This means that for ""peak"" graphics performance, you are using an SSD interface that comes from the chipset, which is on it's own 4x link to the CPU. That 4x link is shared for USB, networking, other drives, etc. etc. etc. etc.

There is also the fun of dealing with the oddities of the RAID controller - since building this new system, I've had the RAID array dump one of the drives into a failed state and then refuse to boot until I've done a Windows startup repair, which needs an install USB with the RAID Drivers (I've gone and slipstreamed them in now so I don't have to faff with manual driver loading from the recovery command prompt). This is a new ""feature"" that I didn't have on the AM4 build, and really kills the redundancy benefits from having an OS mirror...

""Any read request can be serviced and handled by any drive in the array; thus, depending on the nature of I/O load, random read performance of a RAID 1 array may equal up to the sum of each member's performance,[a] while the write performance remains at the level of a single disk. However, if disks with different speeds are used in a RAID 1 array, overall write performance is equal to the speed of the slowest disk.[14][15]

Synthetic benchmarks show varying levels of performance improvements when multiple HDDs or SSDs are used in a RAID 1 setup, compared with single-drive performance. However, some synthetic benchmarks also show a drop in performance for the same comparison""",2

assuming you're talking about the back. you would have front fans pulling air in. this air needs to get out. travels to the back and then meets with another intake fan. hot air will circulate a little more. essentially 2 pulls on opposite sides. doesn't sound great.

On the right side there is a spot for two fans, one at the top and one on the bottom. I haven't installed those two yet because I was deciding the orientation. I figure I have enough of each and having both as exhaust might be too much. I figure if the intake is on the bottom right and the exhaust is top right then the intake shouldn't be affected by the exhaust at the top if there was space.

>If I upgrade my processor and nothing else, will that be good enough to play on 60 fps?

What's your GPU and CPU usage during gaming at the moment? If the GPU is already pegged at 100%, upgrading the CPU only won't help.

A quick Google search for ""Marvel Rivals GTX1060"" [turned this up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Avq4QSgfAKQ): a Ryzen 7 3700x with a GTX1060 6GB not even hitting 60 FPS at 1080p lowest. And [this one with a 1060 3GB not being CPU limited by a 4790K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feBsA5dWsn8).

1icle53,Is a x3d cpu needed for 4k gaming?,jaredsilloph,Interesting_Fee6138,"Yes, at 4K resolution, the GPU is generally more important than the CPU, especially for gaming. However, since you're focusing on photo and video editing, your CPU choice still matters.

Video editing software like Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve rely heavily on CPU performance for tasks like rendering, encoding, and timeline scrubbing. The Ryzen 7700 is a solid choice, but if your workload includes heavy video editing, color grading, or effects, a higher-end CPU with more cores (like a 12-core option) could offer better long-term performance. It all depends on the budget.",5
1icle53,Is a x3d cpu needed for 4k gaming?,jaredsilloph,whomad1215,"7700 is more like $300

but yes, 4k is more gpu bound, it can still benefit from a better cpu at times",3
1icle53,Is a x3d cpu needed for 4k gaming?,jaredsilloph,BaronB,"CPU doesn’t care about the resolution or (most) quality settings. It’ll run the game at the same frame time regardless of what those are set to. Note frame *time*, not frame rate. That is how long it takes to execute a single game update.

The GPU on the other hand cares greatly about the resolution and quality settings. And 4k is especially hard to render. And if the GPU takes longer to render a frame than the CPU, then the CPU will be waiting on the GPU and your frame rate thus whatever the GPU can do.

Most current games will be GPU limited at 4k, so getting a *7600* vs a 9800X3D will make little difference in the frame rate you see. But there are legitimately a few games out today that will still be CPU limited at 4k, even with a 9800X3D, assuming you have a 4080 or 4090. And there will likely be more and more games in the future that will as well.

That’s not to say that you shouldn’t go with a 7700 now, as most games won’t see a benefit, and the 7700 is already an excellent gaming CPU. It’s just to say that the 9800X3D isn’t *entirely* pointless for 4k.

I’d also say that when it comes to AM5 gaming, your real choices are:

7600, 7600X, 9600, 9600X, 7800X3D, or 9800X3D.

Between the 7600 and 7700X the gaming performance difference is a tiny single digit percentage difference. And if you enable PBO, a 7600 and 7700X will perform functionally exactly the same. Between the 7600 and 7600X is more about which is cheaper, and if you want to use the stock cooler or not as the X suffix version does not include it.

The 9600X is faster in gaming than a 7700X, even with PBO enabled on the 7700X but not the 9600X, but is less expensive than it. So it’s kind of the only logical step up. The 9700X is ever so slightly faster still, but not worth the $100 price increase.

The 7800X3D is a massive 25%\~30% performance increase beyond the 9600X, and the 9800X3D is another 20%\~30% beyond that.

The #700X CPUs add two more cores, which are good for systems where you want additional multithreaded performance for non-gaming applications. But just gaming, even gaming and streaming, it’s not really useful.",3
1icle53,Is a x3d cpu needed for 4k gaming?,jaredsilloph,No_Guarantee7841,4k is like zero context info. Even on a 5090 you cant run max settings on several games.

Especially if we are talking about new dlss transformer model which has turned even performance mode into actually very usable.,2
1icle53,Is a x3d cpu needed for 4k gaming?,jaredsilloph,baumaxx1,"No, a 5700x3D and up will be pretty optimal for 4k120 in most cases with a not-completely-insane priced GPU.
... So a 7600x or better out of modern non x3D CPUs is going to be pretty good. Unless you're playing with a 4080 or better, you're not going to benefit that much from a better CPU if you run optimised settings and FPS targets. Even a 3090 isn't going to Max out a 5800x3D in most cases, and when it does, you're also pretty much on the line GPU wise because you're running RT, or you're destroying your image anyway with too much upscaling.

Balance within your budget, optimise settings, leave room for growth but don't go crazy buying performance you're not going to use because you might upgrade in a few years (where the midrange will outpace whatever the current high end option is anyway).

1iclcay,Should I buy a PC or wait until I move halfway across the world?,Upbeat-Scar-2641,BigDickConfidence69,Depends on how much it is to ship it.  You could put it in the box the case comes in and check it on the plane. Might be cheaper than shipping. Might even be free if you only need one suitcase. Most international flights allow 2 checked items. I’d probably remove the gpu however and bring it separately in a suitcase or carry on.,1

ITX builds are more expensive to build. I would just use the gaming laptop to start with.

Keep the GPU box as it will be much safer to ship it out of the case. The AIO should be fine to leave installed, but not a bad idea to take it out as well.",1

1iclbzm,RAM Size Question - Mis-match size of same Type,GeoEatsRocks,heliosfa,"""It's complicated"" is the short answer.

The long answer is that you can run all four sticks, especially if you find that 16GB is not enough, but may find that you can't run it at 3600 MT/s. If you run all four, you run the same config in each channel, i.e. an 8GB and a 16GB per channel. What's the rest of your system specs?

In more detail, if these are all single-rank modules and they have the same XMP profiles, then there is a good chance this will work on any platform where the 8GBs were running at 3600 MT/s and you might see a little performance improvement from interleaving. If you have a mix of single-rank and dual-rank (so three ranks per channel), whether it works or not is less certain. Four ranks per channel is far harder to run at XMP speed.

If it won't hit XMP, then it's very much a question of does the extra capacity offset the loss in performance for you.",1
1iclbzm,RAM Size Question - Mis-match size of same Type,GeoEatsRocks,dweller_12,"If they're the same speed then there's no penalty running 4x sticks with DDR4. That's only on DDR5 and high speed overclocked DDR5 specifically. 2x8 + 2x16 works as 48GB dual channel, just put them in alternating slots.

Also FYI 2x32GB kits of DDR4 are like $90, not 2x16GB. You might have overpaid.",1

I would strongly recommend an AIO liquid freezer with a 5090. The 5090, especially Founders Edition is a card at an unparalleled power level. 

I was an early adopter with a 3090 Founders Edition and even that worked very poorly with air coolers. The hot air would blow straight into the cooler:

With a 5090, I would be afraid of impaired exhaust airflow with a massive air cooler over it. This would be the area of the blue line in the above image. 

The Crucial P3 Plus is QLC SSD. Basically this means it's a 2TB SSD, but they force 4TB of data onto it by writing half as big and using a smaller ""font"". These SSDs start fast, and then get slower and slower as they have to keep decreasing the size they write at. Also this method results in them having under half the lifespan. 

The MSI SSD is better cheaper. The SN850X is a great choice for a high end build. The Team Z540 is the best, and isn't unreasonable for a build where everything else is the best:

Seriously, it's hard to predict market trends that will influence purchases. Will 8 cores be sufficient in 4 or 6 years from now? What will GPU tech be like next gen (seeing as Blackwell is kind of mid outside of framegeneration and promises of ""megatextures"", and RDNA4 is afraid of the market)? Will HDR stop sucking on PC?

The best time to build a new system is when you need it, and the best thing to buy is what meets your needs today. Money in your pocket for upgrades down the road is the only true futureproofing, everything else is a gamble. 

If you're asking what a ""safe"" gamble is, it's likely that modern X3D CPUs will continue to dominate the market for a while. If you can get a hold of one, it's something that's more likely to last longer than a non-X3D chip, or an Intel one (unless they can truly make the Core Ultra series magically better with updates, but the jury is still out on that).",3

[Now, here's the update from last month with a bunch of 2024 released titles.](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gpu-test-system-update-for-2025/2.html )

4070s 15% faster than 7800XT

4070s 4% faster than 7900GRE


About 7% swing in one year. Let's go through some of the bigger 2024 titles:

[Black Myth Wukong](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/black-myth-wukong-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 26% faster than 7800XT, nearly as fast as 7900XT

[Silent HIll 2](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/silent-hill-2-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 44% faster than 7800XT, nearly as fast as 7900XTX\(!\)

 [Dragon Age Veilguard](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 21% faster than 7800XT.

[Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/star-wars-outlaws-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html ) - 4070s 26% faster than 7800XT.

There's so many games releasing now that use UE5/RT that you can't turn off, it's almost like AMD has shifted down a tier compared to Nvidia. Already 7% average in one year, where's it going to be a few years from now? Especially if more games are like SH2?

Even in pure raster, the lack of RT will a far bigger problem long term than the lack of vRAM, with the latter you can just turn down settings. Add in the fact that RDNA3 is going to be a dead end in terms of features (won't support FSR 4 for example), they're just not cheap enough to recommend now.

Look at this way - the 4070s is now 15% ahead of the 7800XT,  but using the links in OP it's about 20% more expensive, so even in pure price:performance it's barely behind anymore.",1

Any brand and any drive can fail. I tend to buy used and run hardware a very long time these days. I do a full format and than a thorough SMART test on all new to me drives.

Last year I tested 6x HDD all of them were older and were being thrown into a PC built out of spare parts or as data storage. Turns out 2x were dying and I didn't know that till I tested them. The full format forces it to write to every sector and than the SMART test will test everything it can afterwards, this should pick up faults if there are any on the HDD.

Good luck finding a b580 for its advertised price. People keep uncharging the card because they’re having trouble keeping them in stock. 

Also just upgrading your gpu to a b580 without replacing your old ddr3 era platform is an awful idea. Intel gpus have the worst cpu overhead of the three gpu makers.

And one more thing, I’m 100% sure intel cpus and motherboards didn’t get rebar support until 10th gen so I highly doubt you have rebar enabled on your 4th gen intel system without some sort of mod.",1

You need to consider electrical costs when comparing also. It’s really that different.

I mostly play games in 4K native resolution without RT, except for some games, and games that force RT with no option to turn it off. In my observation, the gaming experience doesn’t change much whether RT is on or off. Some games like Cyberpunk, Alan Wake 2, and Horizon do shine when RT is enabled, though this doesn’t mean these games are bad without RT—it’s just my personal taste.

I also find DLSS to be helpful, and not as bad as some people say, especially since it helps reduce the load on my GPU. I have a 10L SFFPC (FormD T1), so excessive heat is my enemy.

**Overall**, I recommend the 4070 Ti Super over the 7900 XTX for the reasons mentioned above. More upcoming AAA games will likely force RT, so DLSS will be very useful. While the upcoming 9070 is expected to significantly improve RT, given your situation, it’s better to choose between these two options or consider a used 4080 Super. That said, you can't go wrong with either option—I love my 7900 XTX, and it has served my needs well.",15

The XTX was not bad at all, I believe it is around 15% faster than the 4070 TiS. It does consume more power if you care about that. If DLSS and RT are important for Nvidia, but if you want the raster and vram go XTX.",82
1iciy02,4070 TI SUPER or 7900XTX,Markoni1100,RevolutionaryCarry57,"Well, in the multiplayer titles she'll have a very similar experience with both cards honestly. The major differences are really going to be in those specific single player games like Cyberpunk.

**The 4070TI Super** is a competent RT card that can dabble in path tracing with the right combination of DLSS and frame gen. It also has access to DLSS 4's new transformer model which is proving to make even Performance level upscaling very viable. Some are even saying it practically matches the Quality mode from the old CNN model. Those features make the Nvidia card more enticing for Cyberpunk imo, BUT that's only one game... If you think Cyberpunk will be a gateway for her to dive into other graphics intensive/heavy RT titles, then that could make a stronger case for this card.

**The 7900XTX** on the other hand is really a powerhouse of a card. In terms of rasterized 1440p Ultra gaming, she'd probably see 10-20fps more from the AMD card depending on the game. And that gap would likely grow if you enabled upscaling on both cards. Generally speaking I'd say this is the better 1440p card, but you're not going to be doing very heavy ray tracing with it and you will notice the quality drop when using upscaling. Unfortunately it's still not confirmed that the 7000 series cards will get access to FSR 4 (which seems to be really closing the gap between FSR and DLSS), and if they do eventually get it, it could very likely be a software based version similar to XeSS on non-Intel cards.

**Overall:** I don't think you'll go wrong with either card, and in most cases I doubt your girlfriend will notice the difference. If you think she's really going to fall in love with Cyberpunk and you want her to have the best experience in that specific title, then the 4070TI Super is probably the better buy.

The 7900 XTX isn't totally bad at ray tracing - its a bit behind the 4070 Ti Super, but you can't rely on as good upscaling which is really needed for heavy ray tracing or full path tracing.

I did like my 7900 for about a year as I didn't have many issues. Until one day I couldn't stop having driver updates. No matter what version EXCEPT over a year+ old driver would cause constant driver crashes in MOST games I personally play. WoW, FF14, Path of Exile 2, random ARPGs etc. 

Did I get more raw FPS in some cases compared to the 4070 TI, yes. However. I will say I am a SUCKER for ray tracing. Minecraft RTX water is my wet dream lol It's so pretty! I have not once ran into an issue where having more VRAM would have been a fix, not once. I don't think i've ever really got above10 or 12GB of usage. I game at 5120x1440p with a240hz monitor. I cannot for the life of me in any gave i've tried for DLSS notice the difference at this resolution and monitor size (49"").

I won't say sleep on FSR for AMD, but it is NOT as good or well polished as DLSS, and Frame gen for this generation and 50 series is amazing.

In regard to your question about whether or not RT will make her experience better, I think it's a bit of a tough question. The fact is that most games are still great even without ray tracing. Sometimes it doesn't even necessarily improve the game, and in a few cases it can even make it slightly worse by introducing artifacting. 

But that being said, when RT works well it can really make a difference in the ""wow factor."" Cyberpunk is definitely a good example of RT (and especially path tracing) really improving the whole vibe of the game. I know if I had a card that could use path tracing (even with upscaling like the 4070TI Super), I'd definitely use it in Cyberpunk because it looks gorgeous in that game!

I also think you're right that DLSS is definitely worth more than people give it credit for at times. I think ultimately people are upset that developers seem to be using it as crutch instead of optimizing their games, but at the end of the day the tech itself is really kind of amazing (especially the new transformer model). And being able to kick on upscaling without a major downgrade in visuals will definitely allow those cards to last longer than current gen AMD cards ( just IMO! Please no one grab your pitch forks lol).

This is all coming from someone using a 6950XT by the way. So, I'm by no means an Nvidia fan boy. I've just seen first hand the difference between DLSS and FSR enough to know that I will never use FSR performance mode. But on the other hand, the new DLSS performance looks pretty damn good... So, if you've got an AMD and Nvidia card with similar performance, but one can use aggressive upscaling and the other can't... well to me it's obvious that the one that can use it will last longer.

Owned a 7900 XTX and a 4080/Super too, tho I only have experience at 1440p, but at that resolution, most of the time the difference is huge - and I'm not even talking about DLSS 4 yet.   
FSR was something that I'd only enable if it was a must, while DLSS at the Quality preset is usually a no-brainer for me. (DLDSR + DLSS combined is also pretty great stuff.)  
Considering that FSR 4.0 may really be RX 9000 exclusive, yea, I'd rather take the 4070 Ti Super, even if it's like \~18% slower on average in rasterization.

AMD has its quirks, once you learn them you can avoid 90% of the driver/stability issues and the XTX or at least my Phantom OC has a nice headroom for overclocking and undervolting(got mine stable at 1120mV and probably can go even lower), and it got really usefull when OC gave me almost 20fps boost on my 4K tv that got me close to the 120Hz refresh rate and got rid of frame dips.

In my experience, ray tracing looks great, but in most cases, you have to look closely to see the difference. It varies from game to game—some titles look stunning with ray tracing, while in others, the impact is barely noticeable.

Also the performance hit while using raytracing is huge, like in some games i'll get 144 fps but as soon as I turn on raytracing, it'll tank down to 70-80.

If we're being brutally honest though, 95% of the time, they won’t notice much. They might say it looks slightly better or not see a difference at all. At the end of the day, it’s subjective—best solution is to just show your GF some comparisons on Youtube and let her decide for herself.",2

Now with DLSS 4, it’s going to be even better, especially considering when you can’t even use FSR4 with 7900xtx but you can use DLSS 4 and new FG update with 40 series. It’s a no brainer. So 7900xtx will be stuck with last gen AMD tech when 40 series is improving from being already better. 

Only way I’d choose 7900xtx over 4080 super is if I’d get it for $150-$200 cheaper.

Nvidia is only worth the extra money if you are really onto Cuda and doing local AI stuff. Raytracing still isnt worth it. DLSS should be a optional red button.

1icipqg,Need help with audio settings on new AM5 Windows 11 build,Strung_Out_Advocate,kloudykat,"hmm, based off of your description I'd be more inclined to think there is an issue with the case.

Try this:

Uninstall the audio driver & restart

Log back in, then go straight to Windows Update and run it, let it find what it thinks the correct audio driver is, then let it install

Restart when done

Test

Was there any change?

The overall audio (i.e. the rear audio ports/jacks) is working fine and you just want to plug in your headphones and have them work, right?  And plug them into the front panel on the case right?

You can work around the problem like get a [USB audio interface](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Headphone-Microphone-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B00NMXY2MO) and plug it into your front USB port on your case and connect your 3.5mm headphone jack into that.  

Alternately you can get a [Bluetooth headset](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1PRC4L) and just use that, nothing to plug in then, it just connects via Bluetooth.

Note that is assuming your mobo has Bluetooth. You can get a [$5 USB bluetooth interface for your PC](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22) if it doesn't come with one on the motherboard.

Note that I use that Sony headset I linked for work and it does great.  No mic boom but I still come across clear and sound is perfectly fine.

I feel like I didn't really solve anything but hopefully I gave you a few ideas on how to fix or work around the problem.  yell if you need anything else!",2
1icipqg,Need help with audio settings on new AM5 Windows 11 build,Strung_Out_Advocate,Strung_Out_Advocate,"Wouldn't my windows be up to date already? I think it's more my mobo drivers that deal with the audio isn't it? I just turned the PC on for the first time yesterday, I can't imagine uninstalling the drivers and re-installing the same ones would have a different result. 

And yes, I do just want to plug in my headphones in the front jack and have it work, I'd rather reserve the rear jack for external speakers.

Also, it's not a gaming headset or anything with software. Just a decent pair of Sennheiser cans with no mic either. The weird audio mixer option in Windows that shows headset but isn't my headset also leads me to believe it's not really a case or driver issue though. But I'm really not versed in Windows 11 enough to really understand why that's there though.",1

Pretty expensive build for that CPU. If you're playing competitive settings or low resolution, high framerate games otherwise, then sure, but a 4060 is a really suboptimal pairing for the 7800X3D. If that were my PC I'd get a 7600/X and a cheaper cooler, and then dump the rest of the budget into the fattest GPU you can get (and a bit better power supply too.)

1ichpcu,Having issues with new ram?,Croydonian_03,jfriend00,"Four sticks of DDR5 is unlikely to run as fast as two sticks without making adjustments (raising voltage, slowing speed or loosening timings or some combination of those).

These days it's only recommended to go to four sticks when that's the only way to get the capacity you need and then you want to buy a four stick set that comes with an XMP/EXPO profile specifically for the four sticks and ideally one on the QVL for your motherboard.

If you can return the sticks you just bought and buy a 2x32 set, that would be a better way to get to 64GB (though a little more expensive).

FYI, 6000 CL30 is the good Hynix RAM chips so that's probably what you want for Ryzen.

If you don't mind experimenting, you could try running the four sticks at 5600 or 5200 to see if they got stable. And, definitely use a good memory test for at least a couple hours (like Karhu, OCCT, Y-cruncher, Prime 95, TM5) to see if they appear stable.  But, you may not want to run the slower speeds (I wouldn't) even if they were stable.",3

1ichpcu,Having issues with new ram?,Croydonian_03,wyrdough,Try running the new without the old and you'll know whether it's actually bad RAM. Most likely your motherboard/CPU combination can't handle 4 sticks at 3000MHz.,1
1ichpcu,Having issues with new ram?,Croydonian_03,Kajega,"If it's the same exact brand and speed on the box I'd assume it should work.

Have you tried ONLY using the new sticks vs trying only the old sticks? And obviously you tried the old and new sticks together. If only the new sticks don't work by themselves then that's your answer. I'd also turn off any XMP or EXPO stuff until it works and then try turning it back on. All ram is considered overclocked especially at 6000 or higher.

Other than that I'd just assume there's something wrong with them and return it. Try ordering a new one or forget it entirely, I play everything at 4k maxed out and NEVER get remotely close to using 32gb of ram. 4 sticks isn't recommended if you have AMD.",1

1ichd7d,Bios bricked?? [HELP!!!!],vysmvm,Kilgarragh,"If you have a ROM backup, you can restore it with an external flasher.

Firmware update files are not complete Roms that you get from backups or dumps. There are procedures for carrying certain patches, configurations(and purging certain configurations), serial numbers, MAC addresses. These are carried out by update programs, the in bios updating tools and even BMC flashers.

It’s not as simple as sending a .CAP from the manufacturers site to the chip when compared to re-flashing a dump because some amount of perpetual state is carried between images.

You *can* create a complete image from manufacturer binaries alone, but vendor flashing tools are quite good at their job and having a backup of a complete ROM can let you retry that in the official way",2

A 5090 gets you to the later, even without frame gen, which if you don't have the monitor to go with is possibly overkill. A 4080, or possibly even only a RTX 5070 / RX 9070, gets you to the >480hz range fairly easily. I'd definitely not go for a 5090 unless you just absolutely must have the best and don't care about the price.

Case wise, the O11 is a very good, very attractive line of cases. I'm personally partial to the O11 Vision more than the EVO, but that's just personal preference.

The other user's comment about PCIe 5.0 x2 vs PCIe 5.0 x4 or PCIe 4.0 x4 SSDs is a little silly. The 990 EVO and EVO Plus drives support both 5.0 x2 and 4.0 x4. It's a neat hat trick that isn't really relevant to consumers as those two are the same speed. I.E.: It's a PCIe 4.0 SSD that they're trying to pretend is a 5.0 SSD. It matters for servers where they have a lot more PCIe 5.0 lanes and control over how they split them up, so having 5.0 x2 is more valuable than 4.0 x4. But PCIe 5.0 x2 or even 5.0 x4 is mostly pointless for consumers. A good PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD will be just as fast in real world use as the fastest PCIe 5.0 x4 SSD, and many of the best PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs of the past keep up pretty well too. Microcenter sells the 990 EVO Plus 4TB and a decent enough price, so if you're looking to get a 4TB drive, it's a good option. Though really you could go with a Crucial P3 Plus and you're unlikely to notice the difference, even though that's on the slower end of PCIe 4.0 SSDs out there. I'd generally recommend a TeamGroup MP44, WD SN580, or SN770 over the 990 Evo Plus, as those are all very fast options that are much less expensive. But only the MP44 comes in 4TB, and Microcenter doesn't carry them.

For the PSU, go with the be quiet PURE POWER 12M instead of the MSI model. It's a higher quality unit even though it's less expensive. With a 9800X3D and 5080 you don't need more than an 850W. You only need the 1000W if you end up with the 5090.",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,FuuZePL,"+ get a wd sn580 or sn770 or sn850 whichever is cheapest, they're more than fast enough for gaming and they're incredible value.",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,TK-528491,"Alright, thanks for the advice! 4.0 x 4 would save a buck and be plenty fast for me. I have actually been running a Teamgroup 3.0 x4 and it is plenty fast and reliable. I just chose the 990 because it was highly recommended and I don't know what I am doing. Thanks again!",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,TK-528491,"Oh, thanks for warning and input! Would you still recommend the case overall or if you could do it again would you use something else?",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,BaronB,"One minor thing about the O11, and basically all ""dual chamber"" cases.

They're HUGE. Much larger than most people likely suspect they are. They're not very tall cases, but they have massive footprints. Make sure you have the space for a case that size before you commit to one.",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,TK-528491,"Thanks for taking the time to explain so much. I am currently looking at 240-300hz monitors currently so it sounds like the 5090 will be for sure overkill. Can't say I am too upset about it considering the price tag attached!

 I will definitely look into which storage drive I go with. Also, the PSUs all kind of seem the same after a while of looking so I kind of just chose one at random from a reputable brand (I know that is pretty bad, haha). I will check out the be quiet one for sure.",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,MrGSC1,"FYI my comment isn’t silly at all mate. Why? Because there’s almost no reason to go pcie 5.0 x2. Theoretically it provides the same amount of bandwidth as pcie 4.0 x4, just in fewer lanes. So unless you for some reason have a mobo or another part that needs to allocate bandwidth more efficiently, then going for the cheaper option(4 x4) is better. For gaming this literally couldn’t matter less. Even going pcie 5 x4 is waste of money, but it *does* offer double the amount of bandwidth. So even though it’s overkill, it could potentially be worth the investment. (while 5 x2 is just a waste of money)",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,TK-528491,I will look into it. Thanks!,1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,MrGSC1,No problem mate,1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,Darqsat,I would use it anyway :) its still a good case,1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,TK-528491,"I knew they were quite a bit wider but I haven't actually measured yet. I will make sure to measure my space before going with a dual chamber case. Luckily I have a very long desk so I don't think it will be a problem (although I run a triple monitor so still better to be sure).

As for an earlier comment, the O11 Vision is definitely more appealing but I was worried about airflow especially with the 50 series cards. With the vision you have the side for AIO and bottom for three more fans but only one exhaust which seemed potentially problematic. Have you built in the Vision and noticed any negative impacts from heat?",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,BaronB,"The 990 EVO Plus is currently less expensive than several other high end PCIe 4.0 x4 SSDs, while having better performance. When it first launched and was more expensive than a 990 Pro, it was dumb. Now it’s a perfectly valid option if you’re looking for a top performing SSD. Though as I said in my post, I don’t actually recommend it over other more budget PCIe 4.0 x4 SSDs, like the same SN770 you suggested.",1
1icgnbm,Advice on Building a 2k High Refresh Rate Capable PC,TK-528491,BaronB,"Ive not built in either case. I like the looks, but they’re way to wide for me to ever buy one.

Using an AIO as an intake will increase your GPU temps vs using the AIO as exhaust. By about 2C. Basically it’s meaninglessly so unless you live in a very hot location and your GPU is always running just below thermal throttling it’s not a big deal to use the AIO as an intake.

That said the bottom intake fans on the O11 are mostly for aesthetics. You can setup a bottom intake and side exhaust for the O11 Vision, but the GPU temps are actually worse than using the AIO as an intake and a single exhaust. Adding bottom fans as intakes with an AIO intake mostly just makes the case louder rather than improving temps.",1
1icgkwp,Would like some feedback on a budget 5600 build,Throw_shapes,Justwafflesisfine,"Looks great to me. 
Just a heads up, the motherboard has a small chance of needing a bios update to support Ryzen 5000. 
I say small because if it’s been built anytime soon it should be out of box ready but if it wasn’t build recently it may need an update to latest bios. It looks like your model has a flashback button though so you will not need an older ryzen cpu to update it.",2
1icgkwp,Would like some feedback on a budget 5600 build,Throw_shapes,BaronB,"For a budget system there's nothing obvious wrong with the parts you have selected.

Minor tweaks and suggestions I recommend:

Motherboard - I'd probably look at spending a little more for a motherboard with two M.2 slots, just so you have the option of adding storage in the future w/o needing to keep SATA cables around. An ASRock B450M PRO4 for example might be a decent option for €89. That also gets you 4 RAM slots.

RAM - You can pretty safely go with 16GB for a build of this class. Very few games even need that, and the few that do are generally only when using a *lot* of mods (like Skyrim or Minecraft), or otherwise has a lot of user generated content (VRChat). 2x8GB 3200 CL16. If you need more in the future, it should be easy enough to buy another random 2x8GB 3200 CL16 or similar kit to get up to 32GB, and the Ryzen 5000 CPUs work very well with 4 sticks of RAM. It'll also help get you back down to below €600 with the upgraded motherboard.

SSD - 1TB isn't a lot these days and can fill up quickly with modern games. At this price point it's hard to afford much more, but that motherboard will at least let you upgrade a little easier.

GPU - The 6650 XT is a decent enough GPU. Right *now* is a rough time to be buying GPUs, used or otherwise, as new mid-range GPUs are due in the next month and it seems like the used market is going crazy with a combination of people dumping higher end GPUs for cheap, and low end GPUs for insane prices. €180 is pretty good. Not amazing, but at least not absolutely insane. One 

Case & PSU - Will do the job of holding, blowing air at things, and sending them power. Nothing remarkable about either, but at this price class that's probably a good thing.",2

Most recent I can think of

- Hell Divers
- Marvel Rivals

But if I recall correctly, it wasn't just an AMD issue. Same thing with a few Nvidia cards.

Driver update ship out pretty frequent. Outside of those two, can't think of remember any other issues I've had with the card.

Nothing I hadn't really run into with my 1080.

Also worth noting, there is no DLSS or cuda cores if you need any of that. I didn't, but some people do. Likewise ray tracing support is a bit better with Nvidia. You're probably already aware, but figure it's worth mentioning.
I really like the 24G of VRAM, mainly for some VR gear I want to get.

If it helps, here is everything I got for my current build. I've had it for a couple months shy of a year.

You WANT your GPU hitting as close to 100% as often as possible when gaming. 

If you're streaming, then its even more reason why you want this to be happening. 

The nvenc encoder is taking already rendered frames from the frame buffer to encode it into a more efficient format that makes it easier to stream HD quality without taking a huge hit in performance to the GPU. It does take SOME processing from the GPU die to do it - but how much is negligible, people used to say it lower gaming performance by as much as 30% but these days you're not likely to even notice a 5% reduction when streaming with the nvenc encoder.

It is dw.

>Will I need watercooling ? I'm afraid the pump noise will be too loud, I've never seen watercooling IRL.

I'd keep the noctua for now and see how CPU temps hold up.

>I guess 64 Go will be enough (in 6000MHz CL30). I want to learn / use machine learning locally. Should I get more ?

I think it should be enough but also, you are getting a 5090, if you are worried 64 isn't enough just get 2x48GB.


>For the screen, I still hesitate between OLED & Mini-LED

Personally I am a OLED fan boy so I'd get the OLED for gaming and a cheaper one as a second monitor.

>should I get a single 1440p ultrawide or two 1440p monitors (similar to what I have today : a good 240 Hz one for ""gaming"" and the second one (cheap 60 Hz) just for discord or documentation when working).

Personally I'd go for 2 monitors.

>Is there compatibility issues with ultrawide screens ? Extra latency ?

Maybe on some older games there may be compatibility issues. And no extra latency.

>Samsung 980 1TB

That's already a great drive I'd keep it for now.

>Should I reuse these ""old SATA SSD"" ?

Why not more storage is always nice.

>I have no idea what motherboard should I get to support all of this.

1icfjcg,What do I need with a RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D ?,Volko,knighofire,"I will say that getting a 4K monitor is basically a must with a 5090, otherwise you're wasting it's horsepower. It only really stretches it legs at 4K, as it gets CPU bottlenecked at lower resolutions. 

https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/33.html

For example, in TPUs benchmarks, who imo had the best and most expansive set of modern games in their testing, the 5090 is only 21% faster than the 4090 at 1440p but a more respectable 35% faster at 4K. Also note that it averages 147 fps in Native 4K raster; especially with DLSS 4, it's the first card that can really utilize those 4K 240 Hz OLEDs.",2
1icfjcg,What do I need with a RTX 5090 and Ryzen 7 9800X3D ?,Volko,obstan,"Water-cooling with an AIO for the 9800x3d is completely fine and the pump sound won't be hearable unless your AIO is trash. The fans are what will create the noise so just get one with good quiet fans and you'll be fine.

OLED for sure on the screen is the nicest visual upgrade you can get in my opinion. Seeing true black and the vibrant colors, good refreshrate, and really makes it so you can't go back to other monitors. Amazing for gaming, movies/tv. Single ultra-wide or 2 monitors is literally just preference so you gotta figure that out. If you decide on two monitors, its definitely recommended to have 1 oled and 1 non-OLED though as OLEDs (eventually) burn in. Newer OLED panels are pretty good at preventing this though and last a long time with just some good diligence (turn your monitor off and let it refresh). With that set up if you play games on max settings and dlss/framegen you'll be prone to ghosting if you don't have a good monitor.

You can just throw your old storage into the PC it doesn't effect the speed really, just put windows/games on your fastest drive. They don't hold each other back, but the slower drives will stay slow. If you use multiple M.2 nvme ssds then you should make sure to get a motherboard that doesn't share lanes and cut each others bandwidth. PCIE 5.0 16x slot for your gpu that doesn't share bandwidth too.

Power supply just get a solid brand with good warranty and ratings online. I always try to buy one in person so it's easy to pick up and return if its faulty. Heard the 5090 will drain a lot of power so a 1k+ prob 1200 to be safe would be good. On the other hand the 9800x3d is amazing at undervolting and running efficient, so its a good pair. Make sure you get an 3.1 ATX/5.0 pcie compatible one so you can use the 12vh cable for the 5090. You definitely don't want to use the adapter. 

Just look up a good cooler that fits the aesthetic you want, or buy thermalright one if you want the best budget to quality. I cool my 9800x3d with it completely fine for like 50$. The only thing you need to check is the size of the AIO if it fits the case.",1

I don't think it'd result in an orange CPU light, but is the monitor plugged into the GPU and not the non-iGPU CPU? 

Unsure if you tried the CMOS battery itself.. So when unplugged and after capacitors have discharged, remove the CMOS battery if you haven't and leave it out for 10 seconds. You should check the RAM again, resetting CMOS each time (I've seen AM4 RAM issues be really finnicky with CMOS, especially on ASUS boards).

I upgraded the GPU to a better one pick what you want either rx 6650xt or 7600 what you want to pick is your choice for the price. You can see the performance difference in benchmarks on YouTube.

I upgraded it to 32 gb because it is more recommended and the price difference is not too big either.

Also I switched to a decent MSI 650w 80+ bronze PSU because it is more recommended for these GPUs.

Switched the ssd for a more reliable one too and it should be also faster.

The CPU can go up to 120W using boost clock which is essentially a built in overclock that activates under load.

PSUs lose efficiency and undergo more wear and tear the closer you get to 100% load from around 50% load where they are most efficient, typically. The less efficient a PSU is running, the more heat it produces and heat = wear and tear. The common advice is that you do not want to exceed 75-80% load on a PSU.

This is a matter of convention and common advice, though. I'm not an electrical engineer so I can't advise about how much risk there is... but if I were you I'd just avoid overclocking for now if you choose to upgrade.

1icd0ww,Where can I find GPUs idle power consumption specification? (my country electricity cost is one of the highest),dekoalade,postsshortcomments,"There should be resources out there and it's fairly novice friendly with something like MSI Afterburner. It took me about 10 minutes of research to find known stable underclocks (5700XT) when I recently did a build for a friend. In our case, it was thermal limiting a bit hotter than I'd have liked even with 100% fans and I sadly didn't have thermal pads or the time to do a repaste. I just entered provided voltage from a discussion post and was lucky that they were stable. Remember: not all equipment comes out of the factory equal, so what works for one person may not work for you (ie: 5% of people will have the bottom 5% of cards). 

I don't like to provide overclocking advice beyond that as there are a couple of things that can go wrong if you enter an unstable clock or voltage. Given that there is plenty of information available, *I'd rather let you determine if it is something you feel comfortable doing and send you to people who have worked with that specific card as I have not).* The key is that you may have to troubleshoot your way out of it. So if you can't find the information to set it up in the first place, I don't think it's a great idea to tell you to ""input these values here"" as it doesn't set someone up for success if they are the bottom 5% who has an issue. 

What tip I will add is that MSI Afterburner is an always running program and it needs to be running for an overclock to hold. So if you select ""start with windows"" and set an unstable underclock, it *can cause a windows boot loop.* That can usually be fixed by holding CTRL during the login screen, but sometimes requires other troubleshooting.

>I don't wanna sacrifice any performance

You'll technically be sacrificing on-paper performance, but I'd go either a 2TB SN850X or SAMSUNG 990 EVO Plus for $100+ less (both are Gen4). It shouldn't really affect in-game performance or FPS in any practical or perceivable way. 

I'd also go with a more mid-tier motherboard unless you are doing some advanced overclocking. The only drawback may be the number of CHA_FAN headers and you'll need to check the manual before buying depending on the fans. And with 6000mhz RAM, it doesn't look like you are.

If you don't know about your GPU health either, there's a chance it too can crap out.

Even if you upgrade down the line to a 7800xt/4070 at some point, I feel like it will still run well.

Swapped to a a620, as long as if they upgrade to another 65w TDP CPU down the line and not a higher TDP CPU upgrades will be a non-issue as long as if the motherboard supports it. Beyond that the motherboard you linked didn't have wifi so I didn't see that as something that was needed. a620 boards don't support overclocking so that's not an option, nor PBO. If they are not tech savy enough to ask for help with parts on their own I probably wouldn't want them to enable this anyway as it's possible for overclocks to become unstable over time (PBO not excluded) which can cause system instability and diagnosing it if your not tech savy is unlikely. 

The motherboard swap was mainly just to free up funds to drop in a better GPU, this will work or a radeon 7600. I actually recommend a radeon rx 7600 instead as it has more mature drivers but the intel b570 can perform better in various games but intel is still working on the driver situation, it's a lot better in the past but it's not on par with radeon and nvidia for stability. I just put that one in there as something to look into as a potential.

If they need wifi and bluetooth, there are a lot of PCIE drop in cards available. Or you can search for one that has an Intel AX210 chipset which tends to go for around $20 and various no name companies sell it. Which is essentially the m.2 intel wifi chip mounted on a PCIE adapter and you should be able to use the standard intel drivers.",1

1icbav1,How impossible will it be to secure a 5090 in the Netherlands?,jackadoodles,Nitrozzy7,"Securing a new Nvidia graphics card like the RTX 5090 in the Netherlands (or anywhere else) can be a challenge due to high demand and limited supply, especially during the initial launch period. Here's an overview of what you might expect and some tips to improve your chances:

### Challenges
1. **High Demand**: New graphics cards often see massive demand, particularly from gamers and content creators.
2. **Supply Issues**: Production delays or supply chain issues can impact availability, leading to stock shortages.
3. **Resellers**: Some individuals may buy cards to resell at inflated prices, making it harder for regular consumers to purchase at retail prices.

### Launch Expectations
- **Pre-orders**: Many retailers may allow pre-orders. Stay informed about when they are offered.
- **Retailer Stock**: Expect many retailers to have limited quantities during the launch. 
- **Online and In-Store**: Both online purchases and in-store availability could be limited, so be flexible in your approach.

### Tips to Improve Your Odds
1. **Sign Up for Alerts**: Join mailing lists or follow social media accounts of major retailers and Nvidia for updates on availability.
   
2. **Use Stock Trackers**: Websites and Twitter accounts that track stock availability can help you know when cards are in stock.

3. **Join Community Forums**: Online communities (like Reddit threads or Discord channels) often share information about restocks.

4. **Be Prepared**: Have all your payment information ready and be logged into retailer accounts when the launch occurs.

5. **Diversify Sources**: Don’t rely on a single retailer; check multiple stores to increase your chances of finding stock.

6. **Consider Bundles**: Sometimes retailers bundle graphics cards with other products. While this is not ideal, it might increase your chances of getting the card.

7. **Set a Budget**: Be mindful of your budget and avoid overpaying from resellers. Prices can be significantly inflated.

8. **Stay Patient**: If you don’t get one immediately, don’t get discouraged. Restocks will happen, and prices might stabilize over time.

### Conclusion
While securing a 5090 at launch will be challenging due to demand and supply issues, being proactive and prepared can significantly increase your chances. Keep up with community news and stock alerts, and stay flexible with your purchasing options. Good luck!",-2

Furthermore, even if the factory somehow magically produces a huge number of chips immediately to supply US demand, unless the plant is building semiconductors mostly with robots then it will cost more than those Taiwanese microchips.

Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, had previously said costs in the US microchip project would be far higher, and described it as an “expensive, wasteful exercise in futility”.

The microchip industry became dominated by Taiwan in the first place because of Taiwan's highly educated workforce, a different work/labor standard, and overall lower labor costs.

However, these tariff threats could all be just Trump's bluster and so maybe he doesn't intend to actually tariff them or tariff them for long.

Morris Chang is retired and has no access to TSMCs data. The company has entirely changed since he left. If TSMC wasn't going to make money in America they wouldn't have made a factory. 

>Furthermore, even if the factory somehow magically produces a huge number of chips immediately to supply US demand, unless the plant is building semiconductors mostly with robots then it will cost more than those Taiwanese microchips.

The estimated cost is like 10% more, with another fab on its way in 2028 potentially reducing costs even more. Either way, more factories and more production is always good.

My point still stands, chips will likely be much cheaper than you think when such ""tariffs"" are introduced.",1
1icar9y,Is building a pc w/o GPU while waiting for 9070 a bad idea?,illicituz,Intranetusa,">Morris Chang is retired and has no access to TSMCs data. 

Morris Chang retired in 2018 and TSMC started planning to build factories in Arizona in 2020. I doubt the situation changed drastically to make the US go from unprofitably high labor costs to profitable labor costs within a mere 2 years. American work culture, labor issues and costs, etc. have been the same for years and will take many years to change.

>If TSMC wasn't going to make money in America they wouldn't have made a factory.

Look up the failed Foxconn investment in Wisconsin where they built a factory that was expected to create 13,000+ jobs...but ended up scaling down the project later and has ended up creating only a few hundred jobs. They already built a factory but then it turned out to be unprofitable so they abandoned it. The state of Wisconsin had given Foxconn a billion in subsidies to support their project.

There are a lot of considerations for a corporation to make a new factory - profitability from the private sector could only be one factor in the equation. Other factors includes the potential to get US subsidies and getting the support of US politicians/geopolitical benefits.

TSMC was actually given about 6.6 billion dollars in subsidies by the Biden administration to help build factories in Arizona in more recent years. Ironically, this was opposed by Trump.

Thus, besides the promise of govt subsidies, I wouldn't be surprised if the new factory was a way to decrease the chances of the USA tariffing Taiwanese products/companies by getting US political favor, and/or if it was done in exchange for under-the-table promises to protect Taiwan from China or sell Taiwan some new weapons.

>The estimated cost is like 10% more, with another fab on its way in 2028 potentially reducing costs even more. Either way, more factories and more production is always good.

More factories are good, but it won't come in time nor come in the sufficient quantities to offset the immediately incoming tariffs any time soon.

We have no idea how much the microchip tariffs will be either. Trump has been throwing out random big numbers like 25% to 100% tariffs. American TSMC production is not going to offset something like a 50% tariff on foreign TSMC microchips, let alone 100% tariff (especially when foreign TSMC production makes up the vast majority of chips in the world).

>My point still stands, chips will likely be much cheaper than you think when such ""tariffs"" are introduced.

You might be right if those tariffs are coming several years from now or coming in 2028 if/when American TSMC production creates a significant number of chips every year. 

As it stands right now, TSMC production in the US is still in its infancy and will not be remotely enough to offset large tariffs on Taiwanese chips if Trump decides to implement the tariffs immediately (eg. within the next few months).",1

From 2018 to 2020, the company more than doubled in value. From 2018 to 2025, the company has quintupled in value. Tell me again how the company couldn't have possibly changed.

Also gee...I can't imagine why the ultra-conservative, nationalist multi-billionaire wouldn't like his factories outside of his home country. I love how quick you are to trust this guy.

>American work culture, labor issues and costs, etc. have been the same for years and will take many years to change.

As compared to Taiwanese ""work culture"" where they just take advantage of their employees with strict anti-union policies and abusive employers.

I thought this was obvious.

1ica06e,I need help finding a powerful  reversed pitch aRGB 120mm fan,Stuffstuff1,grump66,">  The other 6 are pushing through radiators.

So, you're both making your AIO's as inefficient as possible by using warmed case air instead of fresh air from outside, AND, not bringing as much air  into the case as possible ? 

Pick which rad you want to be more efficient, OR whichever one is going to be for the less heat producing component and switch the fans on that from exhaust to intake. If it were mine, I'd try recording temps during highest stress situations, like OCCT psu test, for instance, then I'd turn all my fans to intake, record new readings, and see the difference. If it wasn't enough for me, I'd try only one AIO having the fans as exhaust, and the other as intake. Its the only way to figure out which produces the best results. Except for esthetic reasons, there's really no reason to buy ""reverse"" fans, just turn around whatever fans you have.",1

1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,damien09,Cheapest CPU upgrade for gaming would be a 5700x3d. But that largely depends how you are playing games. Are you pushing to hit 240fps or similar high frame rates? Or are you maxing out visuals and running lower fps. If it's the maxing out visuals your GPU bound and CPU upgrade won't change much.,1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,crawler54,"what exactly is the problem? be specific.

if for instance you are trying to game at 4k it could be difficult on your system, resulting in low framerates.",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,Comfortable-Mine3904,"I think the best option is to buy either a 5700x3d or a 5800x3d

That said you didn’t post your monitor specs, so it may not matter if you have a 4k monitor that’s only 60hz",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,AtlQuon,"The QVO is not a great SSD at all, it will throttle easier and harder than any Samsung NVME would. But you are not using it as OS drive, so doubt you will ever notice much as I also run games and programs off of it and it is just fine, as long as it is not the OS drive.

Second would be the CPU, 5700X3D/5800X3D would give the 3090 a better chance of maximising fps on AM4. The 3900X always was a bit of an oddball, because of the 6+6 core setup which is a bit half baked, exactly why I went with the 3950X (but I did get a 3080) and I am not upgrading any time soon. The X3Ds will have less brute multi core performance, but better single core power.

It is still a pretty powerful system, but it won't hold well to a 4090 + 9800X3D or (when available) a 5090 + 9950X3D, which will stomp it into the ground given the chance. For me the 3950X + 3080 is still plenty and I can run all professional programs I need as well as I can use it for gaming without feeling much of an upgrade urge a few years after buying. So... who cares there is (somewhat of a small) bottleneck?",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,awfule,"Bottlenecking is when a component, most of the time a CPU or GPU is severely outdated compared to the other pieces in the build. Nothing is bottlenecking anything here.",0
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,I like to have max settings where possible with consistent 170fps (that’s what current monitor runs).,1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,I find that I’m unable to run some games maxed out nowadays while keeping consistently high frames. Even Minecraft for example can struggle if I’m running even a basic shader with an average render distance. More or less wondering what would be the first component I should replace if I was looking to keep my pc semi up to date by replacing a part every year or so,1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,I have two monitors depending on the game I’m playing. One is a 170hz 2k monitor the other is a 60hz 4K monitor. For the most part I run the 2k monitor and like to max out as many settings as possible while having consistent 170fps,1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,"So the reason for recommending 5700 etc is because the MB is AM4 Locked correct? If I had a board with a different socket I could push further with the CPU? Just trying to understand how this works. 

Also would my MB be able to run DDR5 RAM or would it be too dated to do that too?",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,"Fair enough. I guess my question was more what’s my weakest link, A.K.A what would I want to replace first if I was replacing things one by one",2
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,damien09,"If gaming is your main use the 5700x3d or a 5800x3d if you find one for a deal in the used market. Some games see huge gains from x3d cache. If you did more then gaming 5900x is also a valid drop in. 

But you can check if your GPU is being helpful back on what ever game by watching it's usage if you have a second monitor you can use task manager hwinfo64 etc. if you only have one you will have to use an overlay with GPU usage. Make sure fps is not capped when testing. 90-100% gpu usage then everything is good. If lower then the GPU is being helpful back a reasonable amount and the lower it is the more so.",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,crawler54,"in general, 1440p is the transition area where gpu starts mattering more than cpu; at 4k there is little point in upgrading the cpu, it's mostly gpu carrying the load at that point.

since you want 170fps, i'd be evaluating gpu for the specific games you want to play... i can tell you that running cyberpunk at 4k on a 4090, with all the eye candy on and dlss, is 90-110fps situation.

that minecraft situation sounds a bit weird, perhaps there are running processes in the background that are dragging the pc down?",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,AtlQuon,"Locked is a bit of a weird term to use, because there is literally no way of using another socket; it is a platform with AM4 sockets and only AM4. DDR5 is locked to the platform like DDR4 and DD3 before that. AM4 works with DDR4, AM5 works with DDR5, 1700 works with both DDR4 and DDR5 but the motherboard is either, not both. If you would get an AM5 motherboard, you need an AM5 CPU and DDR5, yes. Cheapest is upgrading within AM4.",1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,boaster106,That’s really good to know! Thank you for the helpful answers. I already asked someone else but the reason the 57/5800 are what you’re recommending is because my MB is AM4 locked correct?,1
1ic9zej,Where is my bottleneck? (Gaming PC),boaster106,damien09,"Yea basically the best gaming CPU you can drop into the motherboard without upgrading the full platform is 5800x3d/5700x3d. If you do stuff other than gaming the highest is 5950x and cheaper option 5900x.

As far as ram your pretty maxed out on speed. 3600 is about as fast that will comfortably run in 1:1 sync which is something you can check on your current set up download zen timings and see if fclk is showing 1800 if not you will have to manually set it to 1800 to match the 3600 m/t.

If you have money to burn the upgrade would be 9800x3d on an am5 mobo x870/e or x670/e and a set of ddr5 6000cl30",1

Assuming its for gaming(?), something like this if we're going with the upper limit. Can scale down accordingly (7800x3d instead of 9800x3d, 7900xt instead of xtx, etc), it depends on what resolution you're targetting and what games you'll be playing",1

Intel used to be king of CPUs, but have fallen off their throne due to degradation issues with their 13th and 14th gen LGA1700 CPUs and poor pricing on their new gen. 

AMD's AM5 x3d (7600x3d, 7800x3d or 9800x3d) CPUs are undisputably the best for gaming. But any AM5 CPU is still a good choice due to the upgrade potential of their still young socket. 

And as I mentioned gpu-wise it's a contest. Nvidia is still considered the premium product and have better performance in ray tracing and upscaling and some professional workloads. Meanwhile AMD offers better raw performance for dollar and is much more generous with vram. Both offer solid products these days.",2

1ic8q8z,Best cheap mechanical keyboards?,kaleperq,MyStationIsAbandoned,"When you have a budget that low, you're not going to get anything other than ""mostly crap"" when it comes to a mechanical keyboard.

If you want something good, save up more money. If you can't save up another $50-$100, having a good mechanical keyboard should not be a priority.

Go to amazon and look for ""SteelSeries Apex 3 RGB Gaming Keyboard"". There's some on sale right now for $35 which is within your budget, but it's a 100% keyboard, not 75.

There's also ""Apex 3 TKL RGB Gaming Keyboard"" which is $42 right now. It's got 87 keys. so everything but the number pad.

Trust me, I've looked around. For what you want, you're going to need a higher budget. Of course, i was personally looking for wireless and a full keyboard because i need it for my workflow in a bunch of different programs and games. I also found out I hated switches with light acuation and loud sounds, so I had to buy silent linear switches and heavy springs to make them heavier and less sensitive...and I wanted good looking custom keys. Excluding the custom keys, I probably spent about $250 getting what I wanted.

But if you can just save up a little more money, some good brands where you can get something for like $70 to $80 would be Ducky. I haven't used them myself though. I've heard about being good quality.  For your budget though, there's Red Dragon and Womier. I have Womier Keycaps, but I have no idea if their boards are any good. I see a 60% one for $25. The reviews look good, but the reviews for Red Dragon keyboards also look good. So if you're willing to take a chance, there you go.",2

1ic8q8z,Best cheap mechanical keyboards?,kaleperq,kaleperq,"Alright I'll tell you my situation(see my other posts dor more detailed info). In a minor saving money for a decent pc that doenst run like dogshit like my actual 8yo laptop, target is 1000€ total for pc and monitor, and ill ask some more for a keyboard, but for now its more like show money to get my parents to pay for what i want for me, not what they want for me, since its not a big issue for them to pay about 500 bucks for my causes like summer trips from a group i go to. Spending that money on a keyboard would drastically alter performance, and I'm edging 1440p territory with a 6700xt  unless I get a better option once the current market stabilizes out.

I belive those are membrane keyboards but I'm not sure. Each has their taste in switches, I hate my membranes for being slow and unreliable, anythings an upgrade, I even tried a dumpster clicky keyboard but unfortunately a key I needed didn't work, but it was better, and mainly ergonomically since I made a self designed paltop stand to lift the monitor so my neck doesn't suffer from laptop ergonomics. And from what I tested I like most light tactiles, I don't want clickies, linear are fine but I gota get used to them and I never could, so I can't say anything really about my preferences on them, I'll use what I'll get. Doing some basic mods I'll get it to a serviceable state, and again, I'm referencing Hippios Tech's video on the best budget keyboard, some random name blue fade one that was like 20 bucks that he modded a bit and was fine, ofc compared to more expensive stuff it's not great, but come on, you won't have the same standards judging 100€ keyboard and a 20€ one.

Like it says woots by state and shows a US flag, idk if it applies to Spanish users.

1ic8q8z,Best cheap mechanical keyboards?,kaleperq,kaleperq,"I've seen doubleshot keycaps on some cheap ones, ofc there are ones that ate the cheapest of the cheap, but it's a matter of buying a cheap keycap set, they aren't that expensive.

And do I need software? I mean, I just need the drivers to run it, I'm not gonna do any macros and I don't care about rgb, I just need some backlight, it's not an HE keyboard where I have to tinker with it to reach my preffered settings.

Since I'm not too into keyboards and I'm a hard stuck membrane keyboard user, I think anything is an upgrade to my slow and sometimes non registering keyboard. I do prefer slight tactile, probably because of how used I am to membrane, but still, a small bump like mx browns have(i tested them in a store) is what I want, no heavy stuff like I see many writers want with tactiles. I'm more of a light switch enjoyer(50-40g actuation force).

You can try and sell the i3 12100F and buy a used i7 12700F to increase your core/thread count but without upgrading that RX 6600 you're not going to see much performance increase at 1440p.

That really depends on the resolution and which games you're playing, but generally speaking, yeah it's going to be noticeable. You're going to have a bad time on a modern AAA title, but 1080p/medium/30-60 FPS should be doable on a lot of AAA titles released before 2020 or so.",1

1ic89dd,M.2 and PCIe wifi adapter in tomahawk b450?,Vodux,psimwork,"I'm assuming the M.2 port in your board already filled? 

Honestly this isn't a great plan. The secondary x16 slot on your board runs PCIe2.0 and has four lanes allocated to it. Assuming you're going to be using a PCIe3.0 drive, that means it will have only half of the bandwidth that it expects. If you then put a PCIe Wifi card, that slot then will only run in x2 mode, meaning that a PCIe3 drive will only have 25% of its expected bandwidth. 

If you're using a PCIe4 drive, it's worse - it will only have 12.5% of its expected bandwidth. 

You could DO this, but I would use a USB wifi adapter to avoid the PCIe slot running in x2 mode. There isn't much difference for most folks running a PCIe3 or PCIe4 drive, but the difference likely will be noticeable if you cut the available bandwidth in-half by using the PCIe Wifi card.",1
1ic89dd,M.2 and PCIe wifi adapter in tomahawk b450?,Vodux,psimwork,"It can be done, but there are issues that one should probably consider. The available slots on the board (except for the main graphics card slot) are all PCIe2.0 and the lane configuration is 4/1/1. 

However, if you use either of the x1 slots, the secondary slot (x16 slot configured as x4) drops to x2. So putting something like a PCIe3 drive on a M.2 adapter, you'd already be losing 50% of the bandwidth form the PCIe2 interface.

As for the choice of CPU between a 7800X3D and a 7600X...tough call honestly. If the monitor resolution is 1440p or higher, then the 7800X3D is likely overkill, but could be nice to have in the event you're trying to achieve super high (i.e. >180) FPS in some situations. 

However, if you're able to do something like downgrade to a 7600X, and use the savings to get an upgrade elsewhere (i.e. going from 1TB SSD to 2TB, or going from a crap power supply to something good), then the money would probably be better allocated that way. 

I see in the US that the difference between a 7600X and a 7800X3D is about $260. It's very possible that is within the difference between a 4070S and a 4070 TiS, and honestly it's likely that (again depending on the resolution and games you play) a 4070 TiS will do more for you than a 7800X3D upgrade will.",1

Intel b580 is a great choice ***if*** you have a modern enough, powerful enough CPU.  But you currently have 750ti - that tells me you're probably not running a 9800x3d 😅

Nvidia 4060 is around 300-350, I think.  It's modern and supports ray tracing, dlss4 upscaling and single frame frame generation.  Buuuuuut it's not got much VRAM.

AMD 7600 is in your price range and supports upto fsr3.1 but not the about to be released fsr4 upscaling.  Fsr 3 is not as good as dlss in almost all examples.  Also AMD cards aren't as good at ray tracing.

(Ray tracing is becoming far more prevalent in games, and there are even games that are coming out that have it as a minimum requirement... In the early days, ray tracing was a gimmick.  Not any more, I'm afraid 😟)

With a low budget like that, you're probably better off going second hand...

As such, Nvidia 3080 will perform rather well across the board.  AMD 6800xt or better will perform slightly better than the 3080 in older, rasterised games, but the 3080 will perform a LOT better in raytraced games.

And I quote from my previous comment, ""But you currently have 750ti - that tells me you're probably not running a 9800x3d 😅"" ...  That's a British gently sarcastic way of saying that he probably has a very dated CPU that will also need an upgrade.


2) But at the same time, ***Not necessarily*** buddy... The guy's on a budget, clearly...  But if he had a suitable CPU at release of the 750ti, he'd have a 4770k, or there about...  And yes, I wouldn't run a 4770k now.

Buuuuuut hé might've upgraded the CPU/mobo in the meantime.  Even just 1 generation newer, the 5930k, is suitable for the 3080.  Sure, he'd struggle a bit with some modern titles, but you'd be surprised what the 5930k can still handle.

I didn't upgrade my 5930k until 12th Gen released... And I only did that because one, ***ONE***, game dropped below 90fps in the first few seconds of a race in VR.  (I was playing Automobilista 2 a lot, and in the first few seconds of a race, where all the cars were bunched up, it was slightly choppy... After 5 seconds, it was absolutely fine.  This is because it runs all the physics of vehicles on screen on one core.)...

Every other game was still fine.  I'd hazard a guess that it'd still be absolutely fine now.  (It was overclocked, of course, to 4.6ghz, and was running manually tuned quad channel ddr4 3200c13 (originally 4400c19 slowed to 3200 and manually tightened all timings to c12-c13 equivalent).

My point being, if the OP is a savvy hardware buyer, he could be running a 8-9 year old CPU (or newer) that isn't terribly useless today.  And coupled with a 3080 or 6800xt+ it would still rock.  (Although I'd personally go with 3080 now, even though the 6800xt was the better choice at release, because RT back then was less prevalent, but will soon become mandatory, for example Indian Jones minimum spec requires RT capability.  And AMD 6000 series GPU's ***suck*** at RT)

And if he's running an AMD 3000+ series with his 750ti (a few years after the 750ti was released, but lots of people upgrade cycle their CPU - GPU - CPU, instead of building one all-new PC outright), then he's also going to be fine with the 30 series Nvidia or 6000 series and GPU.  (And, yes, he could also upgrade the CPU to 5700x3d / 5800x3d, but a 3600x with oc fclk to 1900mhz and manually tuned 3800mts ram would still be pretty sweet today also!)",3

Yes easily enough. Aio would be a mainly aesthetic choice.

Sure that's fine, but if you have some more budget i would include a nvme ssd from the get go.

1ic7fht,Question about the Ryzen 7 5700g and its very high voltage of 1.44v in the msi bios and idle in windows,Grand_Distribution44,ZeroPaladn,"Welcome to modern processors!

AMD Ryzen chips pack a lot of different features and behaviours that keep the chip performing well even when it's ""idle"". That higher than expected voltage is the CPU keeping one core ready in a high power state for clearing out background work and on-demand pings, while the rest of the CPU sleeps. This shows off as big spikes in clock speeds for the core that is doing that job, and those spikes need a lot of voltage. Ryzen Master differs in reporting from that other tool you're looking at, since it aggregates the core voltages instead of reporting the highest value. 

Under all core workloads, like those Cinebench stress tests, the CPU needs to distribute the available power limit to all cores in the CPU while keeping an eye on thermals. This results in an average decrease in voltage since clocks are lower across the whole chip. 

In BIOS, power management is in a preliminary state and the reporting is showing off what the CPU is stuck at (since it's doing barely anything, including power management). 

Everything described above is safe, normal, and expected. Do not worry :)",2

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,Gundamnitpete,"Okay so PCI cards actually have different speeds like PCI3, PCI4, and PCI5. The speed, or generation, just doesn't change all that often. A few years ago, the industry shifted from PCI3 to PCI4, with PCI4 being faster. So almost everything available today is PCI4.


The industry is CURRENTLY SHIFTING to PCI5. That means, not everything is PCI5 yet, in fact VERY FEW components are PCI5. It's a brand new standard.


The X870/9800X3D platform does support PCI5, so in the future you can use PCI5 graphics cards and SSD's, and enjoy the extra speed. However, because this is new technology, most motherboards only support 1 or 2 slots of PCI5 at maximum speed, the rest of them split the speeds between them(sharing lanes).



So what this means is, in 2-5 years time, most graphics cards will likely be PCI5, and they'll need to be run on a PCI5 lane to get the maximum performance. A 9800X3D mother board that you buy today, can run that ""future card"" with PCI5, BUT ONLY if nothing else in your system is using PCI5. Since your two SSD's are PCI4, then this won't be a problem unless you plan to upgrade them in the next 2-5 years. But personally, I don't think you'll need too, PCI4 for SSD's will be plenty fast even for next gen games in my opinion.


So you can buy essentially whatever 9800X3D board that you want, and everything today will work fine. In the future, you might want PCI5 for a graphics card update(like in 2028), so it would be good to buy a board that supports PCI5 today. 


But even in the future, PCI4 will still work, you'll just lose a small amount of performance(2-4% based on today's testing).


So buy whatever board you want. It's nice to have PCI5, but without it you aren't really losing anything. It's just a nice thing to have for ""future proofing"".",2

Gen 5 x4 will end up being a 4 x8 essentially.  

This is similar to how M.2 NVME SSD naming is all over the place.  

a Gen 5x2 essentially = Gen 4x4.  You can see this on an expensive Samsung 990 Pro listing it will say Gen 5 on the listing but on the box it says 4x4 thats because the speeds are the same practically speaking for most people though, there is an advantage there.",1

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,jfriend00,"First off, lane sharing is caused when the motherboard tries to offer more features than it has PCIE lanes for.   There are a couple forms of lane sharing.  One form borrows lanes from the GPU slot if you use certain features on the motherboard.  Most commonly, this is how they offer more than one PCIE5-capable M.2 slot (by taking lanes from the GPU slot).  Usually, this causes the GPU slot to drop from x16 to x8 (which is nearly always of no consequence at all - see discussion below).

In the current AM5 boards, lane sharing is more common on boards that offer USB4 connectivity (all x870 boards and some B850 boards) because that USB4 connectivity needs some of the fast CPU-connected PCIE5 lanes.  Choosing a board without USB4 will likely have less lane sharing.

People are afraid of lane sharing with the GPU slot when they really shouldn't be most of the time.  First off, all 50 series GPUs are PCIE5 so if you buy a new motherboard with a PCIE5x16 GPU slot, even if that gets dropped to PCIE5x8 with lane sharing, you have more than enough bandwidth for all 50 series boards including the 5090. In fact, it's not even close.  Lots and lots of reserve bamdwidth even at 5x8.  The 4090 is the only known GPU that is impacted slightly by running in a x8 slot (because it's only PCIE4) and even then it's only a few percent difference.

So, unless you'll be running a 4090, any motherboard with a PCIE5x16 GPU slot will be perfectly fine, even if you cause lane sharing which drops it to x8.

If you want three M2. drives, then you should probably look for a  board that offers one PCIE5x4 M.2 drive and two PCIE4x4 drives that don't cause any lane sharing at all or don't cause any lane sharing that would impact you.

Of course, it just got replaced 2 weeks ago by the B850 version of the same board which is largely identical except it now includes WiFi 7 instead of 6E and a few minor updates.

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,Shrek_OC,"So the internet has decided motherboards that can divert 8 of the 16 pcie lanes from the GPU for other purposes (like m.2 drives) are bad because you could bottleneck your GPU. In many cases though, this is a good thing to do because AMD really doesn't provide enough pcie lanes, and cutting the GPU's lanes in half has virtually no performance penalty. The less powerful GPU is, the less of an effect it has. A 4090 will take a low single digit performance hit from 8 as opposed to 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes. Maybe a 4080 will have a measurable difference. I know if it's minimal with a 4090, it can only be less significant with a 4080. This is also likely to be a non-issue with PCIe 5.0 cards. 8 lanes of 5.0 is equivalent to 16 lanes of 4.0.


Jayztwocents just did a video on this with a 5090. https://youtu.be/WWfjoGZmrTo?si=z7uWHBnzaJ-YI-Ov Remember though that it supports pcie 5.0. So if you put that card into a strix B650E-E and filled all the M.2 slots so only 8 lanes go to the GPU, it would be running at the equivalent of 4.0 x 16, where a 40 series card would be running at the equivalent of 3.0 x 16 (actually 4.0 x 8 but effectively the same). But the point is look how little difference it makes when you limit NVIDIA's flagship to 3.0 x 16.



I do know that the less expensive a motherboard is, the less likely it is to have PCIe switches on the graphics lanes. If you think this is an issue, just buy a cheaper motherboard and rest assured all 16 lanes will be hardwired to the graphics card. Try the ASRock B850 Pro-A or Pro RS. Avoid X870 because you probably have no use for thunderbolt and you automatically lose 4 lanes (the equivalent of an m.2) to a Thunderbolt (AKA USB4) controller. If you want to stick with strix, there's always the B650E-F",1

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,Slyons89,"x870 tomahawk does have lane sharing, just not with the primary GPU PCIe slot.

This is directly from the spec sheet:

** USB 40Gbps Type-C ports on the back panel and M2_2 slot share PCIe 5.0 x4 bandwidth. Both run at PCIe 5.0 x2 when a device is installed in the M2_2 slot. You can switch M2_2 to PCIe 5.0 x4 in the BIOS, but this will disable the USB 40Gbps Type-C ports. The USB4 host controller supports up to PCIe 4.0 x4.

*** PCI_E3 slot will run at x2 speed when installing device in the M2_3 slot. You can switch PCI_E3 slot to x4 in the BIOS, but this will disable the M2_3 slot.

TLDR:

 using the 2nd m.2 slot cuts the bandwidth of the USB C port on the back to 20 gbps.

 using the 3rd m.2 slot cuts the bandwidth of the last PCIe slot in half.

If you are only using two m.2 drives, you should use slots m.2 slots 1 and 4 to prevent any lane sharing or splitting. However, for me personally, neither of those 2 splits are a problem, so using four m.2 was fine.

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,CeBlu3,"I would recommend the X870 chipset (without E), and more specifically, the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi.

It’s a nice balance between being future proof and cost. For example, you won’t need a PCIe 5.0 slot for the 4080 Super, but who knows, you may upgrade a couple of years down the line and it might be nice to have 5.0 for a new graphics card (whether it’s going to be actually utilizing the higher bandwidth or not is another story). 

The MSI motherboard has the primary M.2 slot between CPU and first PCI slot, so even if you use a M.2 with cooler (or upgrade to one later), it should fit (reasonable cooler…).

The first 2 M.2 slots are PCIe 5.0, the other 2 are PCIe 4.0. Note that the 3rd PCIe slot and the 3rd M.2 slot share PCIe lanes - if you install an M.2 in it, the PCIe slot bandwidth will be reduced. Usually not a problem unless you have some sort of extension card in there (network, or M.2 expansion, or whatever). Anyway, once you upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 M2 as your boot device, you can continue using the old one as a data drive or convenient local backup drive - just move it to the bottom slot, and you’ll have 4 M.2 drives.

It will support 6000 mt/s RAM but I generally recommend not to overclock your RAM beyond what your CPU is spec’ed for. The 9800x3d is spec’ed for DDR-5 5600. I am being overly cautious given some of the RAM/CPU issues in the not too distant past. For gaming, it generally means a negligible loss of frames, the benefit is that you are staying within spec and power limits.

1ic7aar,9800x3d motherboard choices are crazy complicated....,Flat_Neat_6231,Shrek_OC,"Using M2\_2 doesn't cut the USB4 bandwidth to 20Gb/s, it reduces the PCIe link to the controller to PCIe 4.0 x2, effectively reducing max USB4 transfers from 40Gb/s to 32Gb/s. Keep in mind Intel's discrete 40Gb Thunderbolt/USB4 controller uses a PCIe 3.0 x 4 link, which also limits transfers to 32Gb/s, and nobody had a problem with that until ASMedia introduced their controller with PCIe 4.0 support.

As for the M.2 slot, you'll want a Samsung 990 Evo Plus, which is thought of as a gen 4 drive, but it also supports 5.0 x2, making it the ideal drive for this slot. It performs competitively against premium gen 4 drives and the 4TB version of this drive is attractively priced at $250.",1

Either way, 8600g's onboard graphics is going to destroy whatever her laptop has, and while it isn't ideal for adding a GPU later it will work and is something she could swap in the future. 

Single stick of ram is mainly for the ability to add another 16gb stick later. 4 sticks of ram can cause it's own issues and the general consensus is 2 sticks is better than 4 in most cases.

I just threw a case on, she would be picking a budget case and cooling is important.

I was looking at the Corsair CX750, but I didn't do much digging into power supplies since this will be a low power PC to start with. Power draw with a set/trip of case fans should be in the 150w range at absolute peak.

Yes, I know there are better parts. Yes, I know the budget is small. I'm asking for suggestions because I'm not sure of all the options. If something like a 7600x would be a better choice even without the ""integrated graphics"" that's a change that can be made.",1

1ic6lpp,New B650/7600x/4070s build is failing to post,KrustyKrabOfficial,Accomplished_Motor_8,"Hi,

I would try reseating your RAM and CPU just make sure they were properly inserted. Sometimes RAM can look like it is fully seated but slightly sticking out. It shouldn't be a BIOS issue because your MOBO should support your CPU. If it is a BIOS issue, you can always do a BIOS flash, by downloading the updated BIOS on an empty flash drive and pressing the BIOS flash button. Be sure to read up/watch videos on this process before proceeding with it.

In regards to the cooler, it is important to have it plugged in, as it can sometimes cause the system to not boot if it doesn't detect a cooler. I would personally just put the cooler on just to keep it safe, but as long as it's plugged in during boot, it shouldn't cause any issues.

Hope this helps!",1

1ic61lr,Which GPU to choose?(used) 4070ti vs 4070super vs 4070ti super,GisbetterthanH,Rejk95,"I bought the 4070 ti s in june. I was considering the 4070s, but decided against this because of longevity (even though it currently is the most cost effective card). The 4080s was a few hundred dollars more expensive for diminishing returns (and also had 16GB vram).
I still think to this day that picking a 4070 ti s is a great middle ground. Great performance, good longevity.
In this case I would ask myself: do you want to spend another 70 dollars for extra longevity?  12gb of vram might be a limiting factor a lot sooner than the 16gb vram (that is: when this becomes a limiting factor). Is another 70 dollars worth the extra year or so of playing on higher settings?
Nice extra is that the 4070 ti s is also a stronger card in performance ofc :)",2

I get why to not trust aliexpress, but for future stuff the info I got from the community is that most of its stuff is crap but cpus, cpus are great to buy there, with some precautions like checking seller and sales, and pc flippers do it on the regular.

Yes, a few lucky people will be able to buy MSRP cards on launch day, or in the few weeks after. But very soon after that initial stock is exhausted, the new 50-series cards pricing will be ballpark 20% higher than MSRP.

This will make the remaining stock of the 40-series look like a deal at the exact same prices as they're currently being sold for. And once the 40-series stock is finally exhausted, it's not like retailers/Nvidia are going to drop the 50-series pricing back down to MSRP.

This is good to know so you get the best out of the resolution you intend to play at.

You would also be aware of upscaling such as FSR and DLSS. AI upscaling solutions are better so DLSS and FSR4 are going to be much better than FSR 3. This is something you should do some research on so you know more about these technologies as they are very important for gaming these days. For example a lot of people use DLSS quality mode at 1440p to play at 1080p speeds with almost native 1440p quality.

1ic5177,Will GPU prices drop around mid February time?,Disastrous-Try8907,SatisfactionKlutzy18,"It seemed to me with resolution and upscaling technologies. I think in your case with a 4k monitor you might be best off with a 7900xt which can be had for an absolute bargain. It has amazing performance and most importantly 20gb of vram (which is going to be great for 4k gaming).

Hear me out on this, even though FSR 3.5 is not as good as DLSS at lower resolutions such as 1440p and 1080p the disparity between these two technologies is much less at 4k in terms of quality. What you could do is run games at FSR balanced mode (which will allow you to run games as fast as 1440p) and have yourself a beastly 4k machine instead. FSR balanced at 4k looks better than 1440p native from my understanding and would look much better on your 4k monitor. Those are just my thoughts. Basically this setup when used this way would allow you to get 100+ fps in many games at 4k with the use of FSR.

Not sure what you're asking by ""not DDR5"". But there's not significant difference between these two speeds, though 6000 MHz is ideal because it's the sweet spot.

Probably fine. Put it in PCpartpicker, add ~200W to the wattage estimate - that's how much you need. I've never heard of the brand, but they've got certification on Cybenetics plus are OEM'd by Great Wall so it's probably fine.

had an oversized asus psu in a system once, wich of course had 0rpm mode, wich resulted in the fan never spinning. one day the gpu was upgraded and the pc could now draw enough power for the psu fan to spin up. this fan, now spinning for the first time in 4 years made terrible sounds, sounds you usually hear from damaged bearings",1
1ic4qwo,Why do companies still release PSUs without 0-RPM mode?,Ok-Moose853,BitingChaos,"1) a PSU is one of those components that *probably* needs constant, **active** cooling, especially under load. Being enclosed means that it cannot take advantage of the air-flow from the rest of your computer's case.  

2) ""cheaper"" PSUs may be louder than costlier ones. more-expensive PSUs will have higher-quality fans with improved bearing systems and may even have buttons/toggles to adjust/control fan speed.

3) most consumer (non-server, non-workstation) PSUs I've used were pretty darn quiet, already. With many being nearly or completely silent. 

I have an ""[EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2](https://www.evga.com/articles/archive/00823/default.asp)"" PSU. It has a toggle button to change its 140mm fan from ""Quiet"" to ""Silent"". It cost $99 back when I got it in 2017. I cannot even hear it unless I put my head directly up to it on the back of my computer. EVGA doesn't list the fan dB, only that the PSU has ""**Zero Fan Noise**"".

After upgrading my system components in November (went from a 300W build to a 500W build), I actually changed it from its ""Silent"" setting back to the noisier ""Quiet"" setting to increase air-flow and ensure the PSU stayed cooler. I can feel more air coming out of, but I still cannot hear it.

Basically:

* what PSU do you have?       
* what did it cost?       
* if total-silence is *required*, are you willing to pay more for a PSU?     

The comedy option is to open the PSU and *disconnect the fan*. This can result in early PSU failure, or even a massive fire that leads everyone in the building dying a horrible death, so I wouldn't recommend doing that.",1
1ic4qwo,Why do companies still release PSUs without 0-RPM mode?,Ok-Moose853,xilvar,"Traditionally, most components of any kind experience the greatest amount of damage when they are first turned on. Thus a fan going from 0rpm to say 100rpm 100 times a day will likely fail faster than one just running at 100rpm minimum. 

In the case of a fan (which is pwm powered) intuitively you can imagine this to be because any pwm motor draws its highest possible current the closer it is to 0 rpm. It also develops the most power at 0 rpm, and is also generally the least efficient. Thus the fan and all its pieces experience the highest torque, highest power drawn and highest heat generated when turning on at 0 rpm.",1

Like everything there is a scale with the base cost version just being the time to run cables from another room.  The first time I did it at my parents house and ran stuff from the basement right under my desk, I only needed slightly longer cables (10~15 feet) which is a pretty reasonable expense for a PC.

There are dozens of detailed timings that make DRAM work and the memory controller is given one set of timings for all  your RAM, but you would have two different memory chips that probably don't use the same timings.  In that case, the only way for either the motherboard (to try to figure it out by itself) or you (if you're customizing the timings) is to set the lowest common denominator (slowest settings for both speed and timings) to try to find something that would work for both kinds of chips and then you'd have to make sure and do a pretty thorough stability test.",3

The build itself will prob take between 2-6 hours, depending on how closely you follow instructions, whether you have somebody available to help answer questions, and how long you spend tinkering with Windows settings.

If you're not going for the 5700x3d than the 5600x is a small jump up.

1ic41yp,Help me prioritize upgrades on my PC,ThrowawaycuzDoxers,Ripe-Avocado-12,"Unsure why you think you don't have psu headroom for a 5700x3d but you do for a 5700x. They use roughly the same power under load, look at the power consumption graph in [this review](https://www.techspot.com/review/2801-amd-ryzen-5700x3d/). 500w should be fine for a 3060ti and a low power 8 core like the 5700x3d.  


My point is the difference between your current cpu and the ones you're eyeing isn't that much. You're still going to be bottlenecked in some scenarios, and you'll have sunk $150 into a new cpu. It'll be slightly faster, take you one step up on the performance staircase, but you spent 75% of the 5700x3d and instead of moving up 3 or 4 steps, you moved up one and really aren't very much further ahead from where you started.",1

I definitely wouldn't go for a similar spec intel chip as those would suck back way more power for similar performance, nor would I look at the bigger core count AMD chips, those would blow your power budget out of the water.  

Your GPU is a 200w card, cpu is 100w, rest of your system we're giving 100w for headroom and other stuff so theoretically you shouldn't really be going over 400w worst case and that means we should be fine with your 500w.",1

1ic3jno,Suggestions for My PC Build and Potential Upgrades?,Routine-Surprise-174,B3nto-san,"That is a solid and efficient build.

I personally would have gone with an AMD Card to utilize the IGPU as well, but given the FPS/Watt ratio and total consumption of the 4060, it is a reasonable choice.

I don't like the case though. I am sure there can be decent airflow, but the way they promote the fans in the front is not to my liking at all.

Unless you need more GPU power for some reason, I don't see any reason to upgrade yet. I wouldn't want to trade the efficiency of the 5600g for an 5700x3D, if productivity is included. You are well balanced on any workload, wouldn't trade that for some more FPS.",1

Loads are lower on the IGPU as on the DGPU's, which is why I went that route. Bonus these days is the option to use the IGPU for Framegen calculation with lossless scaling. 

I ended undervolting the RX 6600 down to 775mv and 1800mhz (50W Max consumption), limiting the APU to 35W TDP. Most efficient build I ever had.",1

The most annoying part for me was having to take my GPU back out in order to move the SSD from slot 1 into 2/3, since the GPU covers those slots.

Will say though it’s a bit frustrating to have these random incompatibilities - with a specific motherboard, SSD and slot combination.

My old PC was a Ryzen 5 3600x with a Sapphire Radeon 5700xt 8gb and 32gb RAM. First off, don't expect max graphics settings at 1080p even with a 3080 FE 10gb card. The 3600x was a fantastic CPU when it was released in 2019, but it's nearly 6 years old now and even when it was released it was a 'budget' CPU. I would double your RAM asap then upgrade your CPU to the Ryzen 7 5700x3d as soon as you can afford to do so. The 5700x3d is the same socket as the 3600x so no need to completely swap your motherboard.

For reference: using my old rig, I could play games like Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with decent FPS at medium settings. Space Marine 2 ran fine at 1080p with low-medium settings. Helldivers 2 was fine at the higher end of medium settings.

The extra 2gb of vram you will have with the 3080 FE might make a small difference in how high you can run 1080p games, but the 3600x and 16gb RAM will be your primary bottlenecks.",1

Then at that point you'd be getting a cpu, mobo, and ram all at once. The new processor will be better plus you'll be getting better ram, so you'll see a difference for sure. And later on when you would be upgrading your cpu anyways you can focus solely on the cpu and maybe the gou at that point. But you'll have 2 upgrades already out of the way. The only things I would really highly recommend for the mobo is make sure the memory clock speed is high enough so that you can enable expo (some mobos I've seen can only support like 4500mhz ram) and also make sure the mobo has a good vrm. The 8500g is a 65 watt cpu so it's not problem finding anything that can handle it. It's mainly for later on when you get a new cpu and say you got a mobo right now and the vrm can only handle a 105 watt cpu, then you want to put a 120 watt cpu in it, you will need to upgrade your mobo AGAIN.

8600G


- Newer Architecture, improved single and multi-threaded performance.


- Integrated Graphics, 760M isn't something to sneeze at. Everyday and light 1080p it's perfect! (I personally use a 5600G in my HTPC, I'd upgrade to a 8600G...eventually.)


- Higher clock speeds.


- PCIe 5.0 support.


5600X


- Lower price (50% cheaper in my neck of the woods!)


- Larger L3 cache.

1ic2ne9,What do I upgrade on my PC to improve Photoshop/Blender performance?,1290347831209,fuddyduddyc,"Upgrading to a Ryzen 5000 (like the 5700X) would provide a good bump in performance over the Ryzen 3600.

* See [these benchmarks from Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/amd-ryzen-5000-series-cpu-review-roundup-1962/) (first chart is for Photoshop) - there's about a 30% increase in performance from the Ryzen 3600XT to the Ryzen 5800X.
* You'd just need to update the BIOS on your motherboard to support the Ryzen 5000 series.

The RAM in your configuration is not optimal - from what I understand, running 3 sticks of RAM means they're running in unoptimized single channel configuration (plus the speeds are not great).  Getting 2x16GB of 3200mhz or 3600mhz RAM would provide a boost, though how much (especially in Photoshop) I do not know.

Blender rendering can leverage Nvidia features for a performance boost, so you would want to stick with Nvidia.  VRAM can be important when rendering large scenes images.  Given that, an upgrade to a video card like the RTX 4070 Super can provide a big increase in rendering speed (though also more expensive).

* [Blender rendering benchmarks from Puget](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/blender-nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-series-performance/) \- the 4070 Ti renders about 123% faster than the 3060 Ti
* [More Blender rendering benchmarks from Puget](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-super-series-content-creation-review/) \- these show the 4070 Super performing about the same as the 4070 Ti.
* One caveat is that you would need to upgrade your power supply to support a more powerful GPU like the 4070 Super.
* If you don't care about speed and aren't having any issues with your 3060 Ti currently, then not necessary to upgrade.  The newer more powerful cards will just do it faster.",1

If these spikes exceed your PSU limit, the system will shut down

With B650m I was only barely able to get my 2x32 kit to do 6200 1:1. I say barely because some of the timings are on the looser side (tRP, tRAS, tRDRD and tWRWR SCLs) and my CPU's IMC is also pretty poor, requiring 1.265 vSOC for this speed. As a consequence, I can't raise my FCLK to even 2067.

  
Fingers crossed I'll be able to run 8000 2:1 on the new board, (which was actually easily done with a 2x16 kit that I have since returned) but honestly since I can return my current board I don't mind spending another $10-20 to get onto a newer platform.",1

If you want to upgrade anything I would recommend a stronger GPU, however ray tracing is a hard constraint. The 7900 XT would be in your budget for way better rasterized performance but it's ray tracing kinda sucks. I think you could look at a 4070 super for slightly more performance or a 4070 to super but I think that brings you over budget.

Edit - if it helps, here is a comparison video that does pretty in depth on the 4070 Ti Super and the 7900 XT. The 7900 XT is on average 10% better across the board, but the 4070 Ti Super is better for Ray Tracing https://youtu.be/uWXbVNsPicY?si=JrO9aiNssKr5DrX1

Just keep in mind that in very hardcore ray tracing titles like cyberpunk, neither of these GPUs will be able to keep up at the highest settings. Additionally the 7900 XT is significantly cheaper in and in your stated budget, you would have to go down to the 4070 super or maybe a 4070 Ti non-super to stay in your budget",1

1ic1jhs,New builder needing help with part picking,OkBeginning5642,Isthmus11,"The increased memory is a no brainer at this build price, you want 32GB to make the overall system feel snappier and it will improve performance in some gaming use cases.

Yes, the ryzen 7600x is a newer CPU that on average performs the same as a 12700k but it pulls less watts to do the same work, and it's on a new platform from AMD that is still receiving new generations, the 12th gen Intel platform is long dead. So in the next few years if you want to upgrade the CPU without getting a new motherboard, you can. Ideally you would get a 7600x3D or 7800x3D but the 7600 model is very hard to find these days and the 7800x3D is a bit out of your price range.

If you want a 4070 super just get the cheapest one available, the performance difference between AIB models is very small. Just check what kind of warranties the company provides, that's pretty much all that matters

This AM4 Build is even cheaper and would still be a great upgrade for you  https://pcpartpicker.com/list/CCHm3w

I would recommend you take your savings and save up for a new GPU. There are a lot of good used options out there but if you want to buy new a Radeon 6600 is around $200 and an Arc B570 is around $235, those would be ones to target for around double to almost triple the 1080p performance of your 1050Ti. It wasn't a strong card when it launched and it's more than 8 years old now

Edit - if you have further budget constraints there are even some cheaper options than what I linked. We could look at doing a ryzen 5500 or possibly a 12400f Intel chip for the CPU, or just used the stock cooler from AMD to save a few bucks as well.

Just understand that frame rates are going to be low with anything more than eSports games that are already simplistic in nature. 

1080p low with eSports games are going to be pretty decent. Even Fortnite or Roblox if thats your fancy. 

Cyberpunk is not going to be a good experience even at 720p without running FSR - which means the actual render resolution is even lower. 

Look at people running their own tests with the 5600G on youtube. 


Its a good APU if you just want something to get you going until you get a GPU. Just dont expect it to work miracles.



This video of Elden Ring on the 5600G at 1080p, on a static scene shows what is basically best-case scenario for the APU and the game: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9Zz7OgPcuU

If you're okay with that, have at it. 

Otherwise, better to balance a lesser CPU with a low-tier GPU to get a better overall gaming experience than what an APU can deliver.",1

1ic1gff,Is Ryan 5 5600G without a GPU a good option for budget gaming ?,suhaib_sh7,B3nto-san,"I am still using the 5600g both with and without dedicated GPU.

Using it since release and am still more than pleased with either variant. It is still my favorite CPU/APU and I am not even interested in exchanging it any time soon.

We also got lossless scaling around, which can help a lot, both for really old games like Syberia or newer titles, that don't support any kind of scaling or frame generation,

Low consumption in any load, adding a AMD GPU later on free up the IGPU, so you can use the complete IGPU power for frame generation, which really lifts this one up even more. DGPU will always be able to be fully utilized, as you don't need to use any resources for LS.

IGPU does not suffer from the multi monitor power issue other GPU's have. Running 2 Monitors only requires 3W.

With all this scaling and frame generation getting better and better, the Steam Deck and other Handhelds being favored by a lot of ppl, a lot of games try to fit this market as well. So even though it is not the strongest APU out there, you will still have tons of new games out there that will run perfectly fine just on the IGPU alone.

On top of that, you can use it for any kind of cloud gaming and will have a super efficient unit that consumes way below what a normal setup would require.

Be aware that games are starting to use DX12\_2 though, which will not be supported by the IGPU, to be fair, a 1650 Super doesn't either.

Still this offers roughly 30 years of game development and going for a board like the A520i AC from gigabyte would even offer you a triple monitor setup.

It really depends on your personal preferences and if you are willing to put some effort into managing this system.",2

However, the 30-series cards, including the 3060 Ti, will still receive support for DLSS 4 and the latest drivers. The difference is that they won't be as optimized as the newer cards, but you’ll still see some improvements in performance, especially in titles that utilize DLSS 4 effectively.

The ""GPT Protective Partition"" usually happens if the drive was formatted for use with a different system (like macOS or Linux). Here’s what you can do to fix it:

1. **Open Disk Management**:
   * Right-click the **Start** button and select **Disk Management**.
   * Look for your 2TB SSD. It should show up as a ""GPT Protective Partition.""
2. **Delete the GPT Protective Partition**:
   * Right-click on the drive (the area that says ""GPT Protective Partition"") and click **Delete Volume**. If you can’t delete it directly, you might need to use Diskpart (next step).
3. **Use Diskpart** (if the partition doesn’t show up in Disk Management):
   * Press **Win + R**, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open the command prompt.
   * Type `diskpart` and hit Enter.
   * Type `list disk` and press Enter. This will show all your connected drives.
   * Find your 2TB drive (it should be listed as a specific number, like ""Disk 1"").
   * Type `select disk 1` (replace ""1"" with the number of your 2TB SSD) and hit Enter.
   * Type `clean` and press Enter to wipe the partition.
   * Then type `convert gpt` to make sure it's GPT formatted.
   * Finally, exit Diskpart with `exit`.
4. **Reformat the Drive**:
   * Go back to Disk Management, right-click the unallocated space on your 2TB SSD, and choose **New Simple Volume**.
   * Follow the prompts to format it.

Once that’s done, it should show up in **Explorer** and be ready for use!

Around 2018 I bought a predator x34 which is 3440x1440. Slightly lower pixel density but a much better panel overall and the extra width was a game changer in many games and even productivity. Performance has never been a major issue as I’ve had almost generational upgrades to top or near top graphics cards so we won’t talk about that aspect. 

I use larger desks with my monitor mounted on an arm or wall so I tend to be 24-30 inches away from the screen so that may be a factor. The further you are the perceived pixel density goes up, that’s why a 4K tv looks fantastic from the couch.

32” is nicer for immersion over 27”, at any res. Same if watching video.

1440p 27” and 4K 32” are the cheapest and most common screens at those resolutions, probably bc those sizes and resolutions combine really well.

4K takes a lot more GPU to reach a given fps than 1440p. Therefore, 4K may be suboptimal for you IF you prefer playing with graphics quality in games set to max. Ofc if that given fps is relatively low (60) or if you don’t mind lowering some quality settings, then 4K is very reasonable for a 4080/5080-tier card.

IPS vs OLED is it’s own thing, all monitor tech has it’s own disadvantages at present. I went for a 32” 4K IPS (160hz) display and it’s been working great for me, in part bc I wanted more immersion and sharper text than what I had with a 27” 1440p IPS.

Its not necessary, but it depends on how much money you are seeing. For 200$? Maybe might as well go for 4k. Especially the newer 27"" 4K 240Hz have DisplayPort 2.1, which mean it can output the full spec without DSC at all. DSC does not really reduce quality, but it can have some complication like occassional black-screen or some weird issue if you have multiple monitor.

I only 4k game on the TV and I would not make my monitor 4k unless I had a 5090. And even then maybe I wouldn't.

I hate the DLSS shit. And with it off even the 4090 can struggle to maintain 60 on some titles maxed out on 4k. It was struggling with some titles within a year of its release. We can imagine it will happen to the 5090 as well as games get more demanding and it will definitely happen to the 5080.

Quality high frame responsive 4k gaming is honestly just a myth mostly for new release titles. We are 10+ years into the 4k era and the consoles still mostly just render shit at 1080p and then scale it. Or run games at 30fps. Or games that just aren't demanding. Sure it runs astro bot at 4k 60z. Congrats super mario galaxy is finally 4k. Very impressive technical feat /s. Or shit that is a decade + old (see fallout 4 and skyrim).

That said, in hindsight, I'd have gotten a 32inch. The pixel density is so high you can't make out individual pixels with ease, hence the clarity. 

But. Because of that, I need to use a 150% display scaling for when I'm working on it.

It won't impact you if you just game. But it does for UI elements in Windows and programs like Excel. I can get away with 125% but it will be smaller.

The human eye cant see any more than 300ppi at 12"" which is about the distance a lot of people hold your phone from your face. fun fact 1080p on a 7"" phone at 12 inches away is 312ppi hence why you dont see to many screens with a higher resolution than this.

So this being divisible,  300ppi at 12 inches (1 foot) at 36"" (3 feet) would be devisible by 3 being 100ppi at 3 feet. This means that at 3 feet 100ppi looks exactly the same as 300ppi at 12 inches.

3 feet is the average viewing distance to a desktop screen. Maybe you are closer maybe further so calculator for yourslef. 2 feet would be 150ppi 4 feet would be about 75ppi (equivalents)

4k at 27"" has a PPI of 163 meaning it has the equivalent of over 450ppi at 12"" if you are seeing it from 3 feet away. 1440p at 27"" has a ppi of 108. which at 3 feet away looks like 324ppi.

So the human eye cant see above 300ppi and you have 1440p equivalent of 324 and 4k equivalent at 450 meaning there is 0 difference anyone can see at a viewing distance of 3 feet (again standard of most people who use a desktop)

So the answer is it varies based on your setup. Measure it out, do the math. Keep in mind this is also assuming you have good 20/20 vision which most people dont, the reality is most people probably cant even see 300ppi at 12"" because lets be honest from all of us looking at screens 24/7 most of our eyes are not perfect...

That's OLED, like even the modded switch I use to play PC games by streaming them in 4k60 to my switch (1080pdisplay) I actually run it at 2k aka 1440p. Like many will know even on a 1080p screen 2k looks way shaper than 1080p. This combined with very high bitrate makes it look super freaking good on the tiny screen. 

Like no it's not as good as my 48 inch OLED 120 4k, but I had my switch before that screen. The switch legit looked better than my 1440p 160hz Samsung Odyssey just because it's OLED.
Having true blacks makes all the difference in my eyes, same as overall colors are way better. For me the Only screen type HDR actually looks amazing on and still has things that should be nice and vibrant. 

Sadly an OLED tv and Monitor are basically the same price or monitor is way more expensive, meanwhile it's obvious way smaller😅.

I wanted the oled lg ultra wide 48inch, but because my pc is in my living room, and we watch tv maybe twice a year. I didn't want black bars and kill 2 with one stone and just put 48 inch instead of 48 ultra wide there. Tbh I'm so happy, it's bigger and still 500 euro cheaper and the Sony has great latency especially for a tv. 120hz might not be insane. But the 60 to 120 jump is more important than 120-600.

I had:

    42"" 2160p (104 ppi)

Yet somehow, 27x1440p felt SHITTIER, than my current 55x2160p, because screen is more far away.

I was using 27-32 at about 45-70cm from eyes to screen depends on a posture, and sitting 90-115cm eye-to-screen with the 55"" one.

And because you can't really spot the individual pixels from 70+cm on a 55x2160p, i'm super good. 

This would have NOT worked with a B or С oled model, because their mounts have a significant sceeen-to-wall space waste (about 12-15cm), i've gone with a G option (55G2) and it's just 3cm from the wall, AND it's flushed with the desk at the bottom.

So, my advice is: take a measure of how far away from the screen will your eyes be, and if it's in the 50-75 range, go 4k, nobrainer. 

If it's 70-90+ cm, i'd say you will be okay with 1440p. okay doesn't mean it's perfect. 4k will be crisper anyway.

It does NOT look better than 1080 at all. I have one and have run a ton of 4k videos side by side with my 4k 27in and my 1080 27in. They look EXACTLY the same.

The 4k monitor is just going to make everything tiny and unreadable, so you'll have to scale Windows up to like 150% or whatever and then guess what? Every single program you use made before like 2010 will not scale properly because it was never made with 4k in mind and not updated. I was using an old version of photoshop and I was forced to upgrade.

3rd party programs you get from github or whatever? forget about those being useable too. 80% of the time those do not scale and are super tiny and impossible to read on a 4k 27in. 4k monitors are a waste of time unless you go way bigger to justify it.

If they want to be hitting 240hz, then that may not be possible at 4k (depending on the game, of course), whereas at 1440p, they would have a better chance. They could play at 1440p on the 4k monitor, but from what I've heard most people say, it looks much worse than native 1440p.

The extra money spent on a 4k could go towards a better quality 1440p with better colour accuracy (which could be more important as they mentioned rendering) and better HDR capability, etc.

If you buy a 4k monitor and then have to play at 1440p just to get the refresh rate you want, I'd say that was a waste of money.

I guess it's personal preference, but a 1440p monitor with a better quality screen would personally be a better use of money than a 4k monitor I couldn't actually utilise.

Since I used console, I had 4K60Hz 55"" and when downscaling to 1080p it was just the worst experience in PC. Like, because of AMD, I used 24Hz for some months, I thought it was 60Hz, but the GPU put resolution to like 4160p instead of 3840p with the other 36Hz. I moved from RX 7900XT to the RTX 3060ti that came in original computer (I upgraded it) and traded the RX7900XT for Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 12GB RAM.

I think 4k is quite the same as 1440p in 24""\~30"" and not TOO different than 1080p, don't misjudge me, I just wanted to help.

I think for gaming only, a good solution is 1440p240Hz if you playing extreme games. 1080p240Hz is waste, because RTX 5080 is extreme overkill for 1080p, it would reach more than 400fps. For 1440p, 5080 is still overkill, so 5070 is good too... But since you need to render and you want 5080, you might want a monitor with around 240Hz and 1440p.

Based on that yeah, I can’t argue a TV might be bad and you should fill your house with gaming monitors but they became stupidly cheap and if you don’t want the Smart TV functionality (considering she already got an Apple TV that does that and better) I mean, I see no point

* **Ryzen 7 9800X3D**: It's an amazing CPU, but it **might** be overkill, depending on your use. For gaming at 1440p and 240Hz, you probably won’t need that much power. The 7800X3D or even a Ryzen 9 7900X would give you killer performance without going too crazy. If you’re also planning on doing heavy multitasking, content creation, or streaming, the 9800X3D could still be worth considering, but for pure gaming, it’s overkill for 1440p.
* **RTX 5080**: That GPU would definitely handle 1440p at 240Hz with no issue, but like the CPU, it might be overkill. For gaming at that resolution, the **RTX 4070 Ti** or **RTX 4080** would give you excellent performance without pushing you too hard on the price. If you want something future-proof, the 4080 is a good gpu, especially for 1440p at high refresh rates.

# Suggested Combo:

* **CPU**: **Ryzen 7 7800X3D** or **Ryzen 9 7900X** (excellent for gaming and 1440p).
* **GPU**: **RTX 4070 Ti** or **RTX 4080** (either will easily handle 1440p at 240Hz).
* **RAM**: You’ve already got great RAM (32GB 6000MHz), which is perfect for gaming and multitasking.",2

1ic0syx,Question regarding hz/fps settings,hhseedboy,A0ws,"No, you don’t need to cap your monitor's Hz to match your FPS. The monitor's refresh rate (Hz) and your FPS are independent. If your monitor is 500Hz but you're getting 350FPS, the monitor will still display all 350 frames per second. It won’t ""waste"" the extra Hz—it will just refresh more often, ensuring smoother visuals and lower input latency.

In fact, keeping the monitor at its maximum Hz is beneficial because it can still reduce screen tearing and input lag, even if your FPS doesn’t fully reach the refresh rate.

However, if you experience screen tearing and don’t use adaptive sync (like G-Sync or FreeSync), you might want to enable V-Sync or cap your FPS slightly below your maximum frame rate to minimize it.",4

1ic0qsh,Memory training issue and only one stick of ram detected,Electrical_Fun3262,A0ws,"Hey! This sounds like a memory issue, but lets troubleshoot further.

1. **Memory PMU Training Error** This usually points to a compatibility issue or incorrect memory settings. Here are some steps to try:
   * **Check RAM Compatibility**: Verify that the exact model of your G.Skill Trident Z RAM is on the motherboard's QVL (Qualified Vendor List) for the Asrock B450M Pro4. Ryzen CPUs, especially 3000-series, can be picky about RAM.
   * **Update BIOS**: Ensure the motherboard BIOS is fully updated to the latest version. Newer BIOS versions often improve memory compatibility and PMU training.
2. **Test Default Settings**:
   * Reset BIOS to factory defaults.
   * Disable XMP/DOCP and run the RAM at its base JEDEC speed (e.g., 2133MHz). If the problem disappears, it could be an issue with XMP profiles.
3. **Try Manual RAM Configuration**: If the issue persists, manually configure the RAM settings in BIOS:
   * Set the speed, voltage, and timings manually (use CPU-Z’s SPD tab to find stock timings).
   * Start with a lower frequency (e.g., 3000MHz instead of 3200/3600MHz).
4. **Check CPU Memory Controller**: While you didn’t see any bent pins, it’s possible the IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) on the Ryzen 3900X is struggling with dual-channel. Ryzen memory controllers can be sensitive. Testing your CPU in another motherboard with dual-channel RAM would confirm if it’s a CPU issue.
5. **Test Power Supply**: Insufficient or unstable power delivery can also cause memory instability. Ensure the PSU isn’t the culprit and that all connections (especially the 24-pin and CPU power) are secure.

Start with updating the BIOS and testing the RAM at default speeds. If dual-channel still fails after manual configuration and component swaps, the issue is likely with the 3900X’s IMC, and you might need to RMA the CPU.

Good luck, Let me know how it goes!",1

1ic0pea,Will a 5080 be an issue in this build?,DkMnSC,A0ws,"* **Power Needs**: The RTX 5080 is rumored to have **275W TDP**—your 1000W PSU is more than enough, so you're golden there.
* **Cooling**: The 5080 is powerful, and it’s likely going to run hot. That 2000D case has solid airflow, but make sure your fan setup is optimized for keeping GPU temps down.
* **Size**: The 5080 is expected to be chunky. Double-check if the 2000D can fit it comfortably—it's Mini ITX, so space can get tight.
* **Bottlenecks**: With the 9800X3D CPU, you won’t face any bottlenecks, even for 4K gaming or heavy productivity. Perfect match.",1

1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,Isthmus11,"What's the temp that you are saying is thermally throttling? Have you compared your benchmark results against the ""average"" target for a 9700x? I ask because I think your cooler should be fine for this chip, ryzen chips are designed to run as hot as possible pretty much all of the time with their boost clocks, so as long as you aren't actually losing a lot of performance high temps are fine unless it's truly hitting like 100°

If it really is getting that hot then you can try a Thermalright Phantom Spirit or a frost commander which I believe is their best air tower. I'm not sure either of those is hugely different than what you have though, I would also be concerned about the cooling setup for your case at large being the issue and not getting enough air removed from the case",1
1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,TheMoltenJack,Which version and in which configuration? I see multiple ones and from the pictures I see online the ram gets covered with the fans in the standard push/push configuration,1

Yes the U12S is probably not enough to cool that chip, either of the towers I mentioned should be better.

1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,Isthmus11,"To a certain extent, yes... Of course it's not like it will scale infinitely the more cooling you put onto it. But if you are setting your chip to 85° that's already under the standard ryzen operating temperature.

1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,Isthmus11,"You are going to have a rough time finding an air tower that isn't going to stick out above your RAM slots. If you want to upgrade your cooler you essentially need a dual fin stack air tower which physically will always take up the space you are referring to.

You can buy any of the thermalright 240ML AIOs for not much more than the air towers, at least here in the US. You can look at using an AIO in your build if you have the space, I just don't like them much",1

I may go with it even if it's single stack. Do you have any opinions about it?

I'd also rather not go with an AIO as I had one die on me and it wasn't a good experience.",1
1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,Isthmus11,"Yeah, I totally agree with the AIO point it's why I don't like to use them either, air towers basically run forever... At most you need to replace some fans at some point.

I don't have any opinions on that cooler really. I have heard good things about the scythe brand but I only recommend coolers I have actually seen in depth benchmarking for, which is why I usually recommend the thermalright stuff. If you can find any benchmarking on YT or tech review websites that actually proves to you where it stands in relation to your current cooler and it seems worth it, I would say go for it.

Just make sure it's dimensions fit in your case. If it's a single fin stack I'm not sure how much better it can be without being ridiculously tall since air coolers generally work based on how much metal you have in your fin stack and how much air you can blow across the metal to dissipate heat. There is only so much heat you can dissipate with a given amount of metal, hopefully that makes sense",1

Most people have their setups sitting on the floor these days so you would never even see a fan failure visually anyway.

1ic0ld4,Best air CPU cooler for Ryzen 7 9700X and high profile RAM,TheMoltenJack,Isthmus11,"Nah, modern CPUs are really hard to accidentally damage. They will thermally throttle instead, meaning that if they get hot enough they will keep downclocking their performance to create less and less heat, if the heat keeps rising they will just shut off entirely.

How much performance would I lose running a two stack cooler with a single fan in the middle? Like a Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO with just the middle fan?

The single fan might have a hard time pulling air through one fin stack while pushing air through the other one, so it might get loud if the fan ramps up hard. But it's still double the fins, so I assume it would be better than a single fin stack setup? Genuinely not sure",1

The testing aside, the main benefits of the 5700x3D would require a powerful GPU to really work out. Also, if the game does not benefit from the l3 Cache, it only comes down to raw CPU and GPU performance where the FPS end up. If you run into a GPU limit, you won't magically generate more frames with X3d.

If you are running a lower end or low mid tier card, you won't have as much uplift as you think. It is a different story with a 4090 like in most tests... but the potential of a hardware part is pretty much wasted, if you don't have the power to back it up.

This would be a comparison, with a 3080. Depending on what you are actually playing... It might neither be worth the risk nor the upgrade.

1ibzg0d,Help regarding hardware needed to run an AI setup,SnooTangerines5208,nvidiot,"I am assuming you are limiting AI access to single user per PC at any given time.

Inferencing is basically not impacted by lower PCI-E speed, only the initial model loading onto VRAM will take a little longer.

Reason is, all heavy calculation is done on the GPU, and GPU doesn't transfer data until it is finished -- and the resulting work is just text. So reduced PCI-E bandwidth makes no real difference. Even with tensor parallelism, only text data flows back and forth, so lower PCI-E bandwidth once again, doesn't make a huge difference.

So, if you check out r/LocalLLaMA subreddit or other similar subreddits, you can find people using extremely old used Xeon setups that costs pennies (comparably). You do not have to be so focused on dual 16x or anything like that. Just make sure board spaced out PCI-E 16x slots so that your choice of GPUs can fit on it.

You also do need to buy high end PSUs, and recommending a big tower. I recommend at least 1200W. 1200W and above will have enough connectors for 2x 3090. Double check as some 3090 requires 3x cables instead of 2x. It also helps if you go with 3090 FE.

Also... while you don't need a lot of RAM, you should still try to get at least 32 GB.

Such setup will run about $2500ish per PC (used 3090 Ti refurbished is $800 from MicroCenter, so if it's just 3090, should be a little cheaper).

As for professional setup -- you'd do this if you want to allow multiple students to access AI at the same time, but doing so means you'll be purchasing expensive server hardware with multiple PCI-E slots + nVidia's professional lineups like RTX Ada cards.

It comes down to the price you want to pay.

I am not sure when the 5070ti, if you are considering that, to release as for how long you may have to wait, but it is likely to be performantly less or close to a 4080S (that is only a guess on my part though.) Price probably less or similar to some current 4080S prices.",1

This PSU is A-Tier ranked on the Cultist's PSU tier list vs the B-Tier ranked one you've selected for the same price

AMD is rumored to release the Ryzen 9600 very soon (within weeks) which may make an AM5 build viable for the performance difference, considering you're gaming at 1080.

OzBargain has prebuild deals that can be pretty hard to beat value wise around this price and part selection tier:

1ibz71u,I want to verify my budget builds part's are compatible and neccessary,gs32d,gs32d,"Thanks for the feedback! The psu is a bundle deal with the montech xr that's why I used it even though its a B tier, also, with the gpu I was pretty conflicted and did recognize the b580 at one point but it falls a little bit out of my budget for now. I will definitely sub out the 6600 for it though once I have the funds as I've heard great things about its price to performance!",1

1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Alternative-Pie345,"Phanteks says that your case supports a 360 radiator sitting at the top of your case. In that case I'd change your cooler to a 360 AIO sitting at the top of your case. Thermalright make excellent value options you can look at. The benefit of this cooling is you can set the fans to a very quiet speed and you'll still cool your CPU perfectly. 

Swap your fans out around the rest of your case for Arctic P12's or P14's and you have significantly upgraded the cooling in your case for cheap.",1
1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Barrel_Titor,That's somthing i need to sort while i'm at it. The case came with a fan hub but it's all 3 pin ones so they are all just full on. Need to change it.,1

1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Barrel_Titor,"I did consider that. Would i make the other case fans exhausts? My worry would be getting cool air in for the GPU.

I was a bit worried pumping that much heat into the case with the RTX 3080 in there. That's part of my weird setup. Years back (same case, basically everything else different) I had to take the side of the case off in summer because of overheating which is why i put 3 exhausts on the top and used that 120mm aio to keep the heat away from my GPU, it did fix the issue. Might not be relevant with my current build though",1
1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Alternative-Pie345,"The 360 radiator would be set to exhausting air like your current fans are now. Set the rear fan to exhaust and put 2x120 fans at the front as intake, and remove the drive cages if you're not using them. This setup should be plenty of cooling. 



If you want even more cooling for your GPU and you have space in your PCI slots you can even 3D print something like this:

1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Barrel_Titor,"Might be worth a shot. I am using the drive cages so can't remove them though.

Is there a reason to use 120 fans as intake at the front instead of 140?",1
1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Alternative-Pie345,You intake in more air with 2 fans vs 1 fan,1
1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Barrel_Titor,"yeah, it's just that it supports 2 x 140mm fans. It's a 200mm that's in at the moment but it can be swapped for 2 x 140 or 2 x 120",1
1ibz0xk,Suggestions for quiet cooling in my PC upgrade,Barrel_Titor,Alternative-Pie345,"Ah my bad, I misread the spec sheet lol. Some quick mental maths tells me that there isn't much airflow difference between 1 x 200mm fan vs  2 x 140mm fans but eyeballing the pictures of this case, it looks like 2 x 140mm fans utilize the space better with less restrictions from the case design and will provide more static pressure overall. 200mm fans also tend to have poor static pressure which isn't great considering the drive cages are in the way.",1

I'll be honest, you won't notice the difference between gen4 or gen5 in normal use, be it the SSD or your GPU. Losses going from gen5 to gen4 on the 5090 are basically negligible within margin of error. Those kinda bandwidths and speeds won't be fully utilized for a long while yet.

Same on the SSD, unless you're routinely working on large files all the time, that gen5 speed will not be felt.

Edit: read up on the 4.0 riser <-> 5.0 slot issue, sounds similar to what was going on with the 3.0/4.0 transition.
I'd just wait for a 5.0 riser to come out, that shouldn't have issues. The problem happens because the slot is 5.0 while the riser isn't. I guess forcing the slot into 4.0 mode would avoid that issue too, yes. I don't think bios settings let you be so specific as to only downgrade that one slot into 4.0, so it'd be global probably.

1ibxher,What GPU/CPU to upgrade to?,Scannedu,ChanceMeet3283,"https://de.pcpartpicker.com/list/g7H6sh

I would get a Ryzen 5600 and a Rx 7800xt. For 630€ from Amazon Germany. It's a bit cheaper then buying it somewhere in Finland 

https://fi.pcpartpicker.com/list/g7H6sh",2
1ibxher,What GPU/CPU to upgrade to?,Scannedu,texas_accountant_guy,"Hello and welcome!

The easiest and most common upgrade in your case is to upgrade the CPU to a Ryzen 5 5700X3D. It will be a significant boost to your computer.

Secondly, the 1070ti is reaching end-of-life. This is more expensive to replace, as GPU prices have gone crazy. If sticking with Nvidia, you'd want to upgrade to at least an RTX 3070, if not a 4070, but 4070s are expensive. I would personally recommend avoiding the 4060-tier GPUs and below.

If you wish to switch to AMD, you can find good value at the RX 7700 or RX 7800 levels. If you switch from Nvidia to AMD, you'll need to run a piece of software called DDU, which will flush out all the Nvidia drivers for you that stay behind and cause problems for AMD video cards (and vice versa if switching from AMD to Nvidia).

RAM can easily be upgraded later on to 32GB. That's not a priority, but a nice to have at some point after first priorities are completed.

Storage: If you're running near full on your SSDs, that can effect your performance. Clear space by deleting old games/files, or buy a 2nd SSD to install for more space.",2
1ibxher,What GPU/CPU to upgrade to?,Scannedu,Tekkonkinyeet,"There’s a few routes you can go. For one, if you want to stay on the same motherboard, get either a 5500/5600 new or a 5700X3D new from AliExpress (make sure it’s a reputable seller with lots of reviews also it doesn’t include cooler fyi). Upgrade your GPU to a used Radeon RX 6700/6750 XT 12GB VRAM or a 7800XT if you want 16GB VRAM (you could try for Nvidia’s GPUs too but you’ll be spending more price per performance). Likewise your RAM is decent (so long as the speed is good but maybe buy another 16GB to be a little safer though not entirely necessary). Depending on your configuration (i.e. 1 stick of 16GB or 2 sticks of 8GB just go with what’s already there and don’t mix them). Definitely upgrade that storage. 100GB is barely anything for one and two, the price per GB now is crazy. You can go with a standard SSD or if you have an NVME M.2 SSD slot go with one of those. Though they do run hot so you could either buy a heatsink for it (they’re cheap), check if your motherboard already has a heatsink, or just use the sticker/label it has as a heatsink (not optimal but not the worst). Lastly, and this is a big one: PSU is maybe the most important/least thought about component of a build. Do not settle for whatever. Look up reviews. If you have one in there that seems good already, great. But still research before putting anything you don’t want fried in there. And do make sure that it’s total wattage is more than the rest of your components. Also the most expensive doesn’t equal best. And the 80+ ratings can be misleading sometimes.

1ibx6nw,New gen kinda sucks. Pull the trigger on a 7800xt?,jlcordeiro,SuperZapper_Recharge,"I am old, I have gone through a lot of these generation launches.

Here is my observation:

There is always some dumbass leading out to launch explaining with much gusto how he/she is waiting on the launch of the new generation to buy the old generation at a pricebreak.

The logic looks sound.  It always looks sound.  I mean, ebay, right?

You need to understand what is really going on.

The card manufacturers are NOT making the old gen up to the last minute.   They stopped making the old gen higher edition cards a while ago and swapped over to the new stuff, they are playing a game with stock.  What they want is for stock to be depleted right before the launch.

So the idea you can walk into a BestBuy and get a discounted 4070 cause they want to deplete stock is something Nvidia and AMD are actively trying to avoid.

MEANWHILE....

The other trick you think should be happening is that people are replacing last year's card with this years card and selling at a discount.

It never goes that way.  Go out to ebay and look at prices.  This bit I have never completly understood, but the truth is undeniable.  The discount you want isn't really there.

MEANWHILE ON STORE SHELVES....

Scalpers are grabbing up inventory as quickly as they can find it.

My advice for GPU buying isn't really hard.

Figure out what you want.  Look at MFSRP and use that as a budget.  Put that money away and don't touch it.

1. There is nothing to worry about. Really. The GPU will arrive, included is the 12vhpwr cable adapter which will have either 3 or 4 pcie 8 ports to the 12vhpwr. You plug those in, then you plug the adapter in the GPU. That's it. There is nothing to overthink about. If your psu is too weak it will shut off. They are designed that way. No harm.

1ibwzs0,Help understanding plug/power requirements for a 5080 upgrade from an older build,dark494,ChanceMeet3283,"1. It's just something that will be nowadays included, so you don't have to use the adapter.

2. Adapters are not the thing that get criticized. It's the 12vhpwr plug itself. These things are rated for 600w. Exactly 600w.

Normal PCI 8pin cables are rated for 150w. But those cables are overspeced. The real wattage that these cables can safely deliver is around 215-260w (depends on the quality). So 4 of those cables can deliver 860w-1040w safely!
That's why no one really understood the new plug. It's worse than the old method, especially if you consider that the heat can't be distributed as well and it accumulates on one plug, instead of 4. Even 3 would be better than 1 12vhpwr plug.",1

~500-600 (my guess)",3
1ibweg2,Want to run DOOM: The Dark Ages. Should I just upgrade or build a new rig?,SplashWetty3,althaz,"If you want to upgrade to a more modern PC that would kinda smash everything, you could upgrade your CPU to the 5700X3D, upgrade your RAM to 32Gb and upgrade your GPU to whatever you can afford (7700XT or 7800XT are pretty reasonable value, 4070Ti Super in some markets is good and comes with all the nVidia goodness).

That said, I would say your best bet is upgrade the CPU/RAM and wait until March when the 9070/9070XT launch for a GPU upgrade - even though your GPU is your weakest link at the moment in modern games (6Gb of VRAM in 2025 is pretty rough).

I don't think you need to start from scratch considering you already have a mobo/etc and arguably even the RAM upgrade is more of a nice to have than required.

By the same token though, it's not \*insane\* to start from scratch if you can afford it - but in terms of pure money-spent vs performance gained, I'd stick with your current platform.",2

* Get a kit of 32 GB 3600 MHz @ CL16 RAM - there are a lot of people selling their ""old"" ddr4 kits for cheap
* Get a better graphics card. Some options (I'd be looking at used parts) - 6800 XT, 4070, 4070 Super, 4070 Ti, 3080. For new, you could wait for the 5070 if the rumored prices are to be believed. If you plan on playing games with raytracing enabled, I'd lean towards Nvidia rather than AMD.
* Last step - sell all of your unused parts to make some money back.

With all that done, I think you'd have a pretty capable system on your hands for at least another few years.

The other option, of course, is to replace everything.",2

Get the Ryzen 7500f from aliexpress for 140 (there is one seller with over 2k sales. Get it from them). The 7600 non x and the 7500f perform identical.

Better price/performance cooler

Newer am5 board and cheaper

Price to performance ram

Only 1tb SSD though. For 35 bucks more you could get the ud90 2tb or the kingspec xg7000

The rx7900xt. It's nearly 3x as good in rasterization performance and has over 2x the vram capacity. It's like a no brainer

Decent matx case

1ibvn73,"Got everything assembled, but when powering on there's nothing on screen.",TaelweaverVictorious,Tasty-Wait831,"Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and hopefully fix the issue:

Check Connections:

Make sure all power cables are connected tight, especially the 24-pin ATX and 8-pin CPU connectors.
Double-check that the GPU is firmly in the PCIe slot and that its power cables are plugged in.

Monitor and Cable Check:

Ensure the monitor is on and set to the right input (like HDMI or DisplayPort).
Try a different cable or use another port on the GPU and monitor.

Clear CMOS:

Turn off the power supply and unplug it.
Find the CMOS battery on the motherboard, take it out for a few minutes, then put it back in.
You can also use the ""Clear CMOS"" jumper if your board has one.

BIOS Update:

Make sure you’re following the right steps for flashing the BIOS. The USB drive needs to be FAT32 formatted, and the BIOS file should be named correctly as per MSI's instructions.
If the BIOS flash doesn’t work, try a different USB drive.

Single RAM Stick:

Boot up with just one stick of RAM and test each slot to check for bad RAM or a faulty slot.

Check for Motherboard Debug LEDs:

Many motherboards have debug LEDs that show which part might be having trouble (like CPU, DRAM, VGA, Boot).

Reseat Components:

Take out and reinsert parts like RAM, CPU (watch for bent pins), and GPU.

Test with Minimal Configuration:

Unplug everything that’s not essential for booting (extra drives, peripherals). Just use the CPU, one stick of RAM, GPU, and boot drive.

Test Components:

If you can, test your parts in another system to rule out hardware problems (especially GPU and RAM).

Contact Support:

If nothing works, think about reaching out to MSI support or taking your setup to a pro for help.",1

Its $99, And while it does not come with Wi-Fi, it has an M2 Wi-Fi port. So you can add your own Wi-Fi adapter which means you can upgrade the Wi-Fi adapter. 

And it's a micro ATX board so I think it looks cleaner in compact cases. 

And while it only has two dim sockets, that's all you need. If you go with dual 48gb modules with all the money you saved on the mobo. 

This board is solid, and a great value, have one in my kids pc with a 6950xt and a 7600x, hes playing everything.

You dont need an 870 unlesd you want the faster usb or extra m2 slots.  A b650 is fine.

This board paired with a 7600x is $300, can do 32gb ram in dual 16 for $50.   

Then get a $100 2tb m2 drive, a cheap case, an fsp sp vita 1000 cpu, and a gpu, and you're gtg. 


All that minus the gpu is $634 atm.

If you have room in the budget to go up another $270 and you happen to live near a micro center, do a 9800x3D instead and minus graphics processor you'll have the best rig you can have.",2

You will have to have both drives connected at once in order to do this.  You can either do that by putting both in M.2 slots or by buying (for about $15) a USB enclosure that you can put the new drive into, plug it into your computer via USB, run the cloning to it, then take the old M.2 out and put the new cloned one in.",1

Updating the BIOS is easy. Put the BIOS file on a USB drive, go into your BIOS and run the update utility, follow the steps, and don't shut the power off mid-update.

Motherboard: - ASUS TUF B550M-Plus: This Micro ATX board supports PCIe 4.0, which is great for your new GPU. It’s compact and works well in small cases. - MSI B550 Tomahawk: Another solid choice with PCIe 4.0 support and good overall performance.

Power Supply: - Cooler Master MWE Gold 750 V2: This is a fully modular 80 Plus Gold certified power supply with 750W. It should give you enough power for your parts and future upgrades. - Apevia SFX-AP500W: If you need something smaller, this SFX power supply offers 500W and is perfect for compact cases.

AM4 vs. AM5 - AM4: Works with Ryzen 5 5600X and is compatible with your current RAM. It’s more budget-friendly if you don’t want to upgrade your RAM. - AM5: Works with Ryzen 5 7600 and gives you PCIe 5.0 and DDR5 support. But, it needs new RAM and is pricier.

BIOS Update Updating the BIOS helps your motherboard work better with new hardware and boosts performance. Here’s a simple guide: 1. Download the BIOS Update: Go to the motherboard maker’s site and grab the latest BIOS update for your model. 2. Prepare a USB Drive: Format a USB drive to FAT32 and put the BIOS update file on it. 3. Enter BIOS Setup: Restart your PC and enter the BIOS setup (usually by pressing a key like F2, Del, or Esc during startup). 4. Update BIOS: Find an option like ""Q-Flash"" or ""EZ Flash"" and follow the instructions to update the BIOS using the USB drive. 5. Reboot: After the update, restart your PC and make sure everything is working fine.",1

Oh dear. You won't be playing anything decent with that GPU.

Yes.  Pretty much all cases with top-mounted power supplies assume the power supply fan is facing down.

The issue you *might* have is whether that uses a standard ATX power supply.  However, as the system is over a decade old, there is very little information on it.  You'll have to look at the power supply label to see whether it mentions an ATX standard.  It's good if it does.

It's also worth checking the dimensions of the current power supply (specifically the side where the wall cable plugs in) in case it's some weird form factor.

AM5 stuff, a r9 9900x is almost the same price as a 265k at some sellers, it has an upgrade path and I feel is the better option in my option, lower power consumption which means runs cooler, the 7900x is also a little cheaper.

  
As for problems, I have only read of a few people having issues with the Intel Ultra stuff, I wouldn't say they are all defective, certainly less cases than the 14th gen stuff atm. I don't think you could go wrong with the 265k.

  
But I got no experience with Music Production so take it with a grain of salt, I read Intel was suppose to be better at that than Ryzen but I don't know if thats still the case or not.",2

1ibtqeu,Ryzen 5950x or Ultra 7 265k?,WoodpeckerFormer8514,AlwaysSnowy,"Total all in cost of a Core Ultra 265K is generally lower than AMD equivalent, particularly when motherboard features are taken into account. You can always buy a combo and if you find it unstable or unusable for your use case, return it. I think a lot of the early introduction kinks have been worked out, though I'm sure there will be more multi-core optimization in Windows. 

If you have a Microcenter nearby, the 265K is only $300 and you get $70 off a Z890 board. The ultimate difference in platform cost to you is likely going to boil down to the motherboard features you want/need. If you need TB4, then Intel's going to be cheaper. I like the 265K for productivity more than Ryzen 7 and productivity benchmarks tend to favor it, but you can always check reviews with whatever software you need to run.

6 and 7 were interchangeable and then 8 and 9. Although all four generations were technically LGA 1151, 6th and 7th gen only worked on revision 1 and 8th and 9th gen only worked on revision 2. So effectively it was still only 2 generations per socket.",2

1ibtqeu,Ryzen 5950x or Ultra 7 265k?,WoodpeckerFormer8514,jfriend00,"That's fair.  I would expect the socket to stay what it is until the CPU comes with USB5, PCIE6, DDR6 or they add more PCIE lanes, none of which seem imminent.  Besides, Intel has much bigger things to fix at the top-end (for gaming) that have nothing to do with the things that lead to changing the socket.

Plus, I think the heat that Intel is feeling from AMD now would lead to changing the socket less often.  If they can sell a 265k/285k buyer a 385k for the same motherboard that makes a good upsell in performance, that user is much more likely to buy Intel that round than AMD (the same game AMD has been playing for a long while).  In other words, Intel is no longer the bully that can force their users to buy new motherboards as often as they used to.",2
1ibtqeu,Ryzen 5950x or Ultra 7 265k?,WoodpeckerFormer8514,jfriend00,That article is about Nova Lake which is not coming for awhile.  I would assume Intel has to have something out at the end of 2025 (perhaps Panther Lake) that's improves upon the 200 desktop series.,2

1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,aragorn18,Buy DDR5-6000 CL30 RAM instead,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,smedema,The small form factor will do more to increase heat and noise then getting a 7600x. All of the things you want are pretty hard fo do with a small form factor especially if this is the first pc build. To have a cool and quite PC you need air flow which like I said is very challenging in a small form factor. 4070ti will also put out a good amount of heat especially in a low air flow situation. Quiet means low fan rpm which probably wont happen because you will need a higher fan RPM to pump enough air to cool that system. ATX mid towers are not really that big IMO and would make it exponentially easier to accomplish what you want. Also you will want CL30 ram instead of CL36.,0
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,ExNami,Ok TIL about CL terminology in ram. Whats the difference between CL30 and i guess the CL36 is my build?,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,ExNami,Small form factor is the part where i cant budge on Unfortunately with my limited space. I know small form factor is prone to higher temps and such but ideally im trying to get this thing relatively quiet by choosing parts that dont require too much power and are easy to cool. Im not trying to render big projects or anything just game and browse the internet For the most part,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,aragorn18,CL30 is faster.,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,smedema,If you want less heat the first part to down grade is the GPU. That is a pretty hot card at 285W TDP. A 4070 would be close to half that at 160W. 7600 is about 40W less TDP than a 7600x but I would rather have the X. Also the RAM you have listed wont even work for the either of those CPUs. Max speed for both of those CPUs is 5200MT/s. If small form factor is a must you will have to compromise on the noise and heat. It won't thermal throttle but it certainly will heat the room and will definitely not be silent.,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,smedema,7600x and non x only supports up to 5200 MT/s,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,ExNami,Gotcha lower is faster. Ill change out the ram then.,1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,ExNami,"Ah good call on the ram. I didnt consider max speed from cpu. 

the power draw on the 4070 ti super did concern me. It seemed like a pretty big jump. Wanted to have a little future proof for games down the line. Maybe a 4070 super may be better option?",1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,aragorn18,"Officially, yes, but basically all 7000 series CPUs allow you to overclock the RAM to 6000 MT/s. AMD even does their testing and official benchmark data at that speed.",1
1ibt5xn,Former gaming laptop enjoyer. Am i on the right path?,ExNami,smedema,4070 is for temps. Not for future proof. Those are on the opposite sides of the spectrum. 4070 is a solid mid range card but yes the 4070ti is better.,1
