Their warranty is a joke, and their products are cheap and unreliable. Avoid this brand at all costs!

What's wrong with these reviews on Amazon India,Emotional_Fox670,2,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetsIndia/comments/1i9o2k5/whats_wrong_with_these_reviews_on_amazon_india/,"I was looking to buy a robot vacuum cleaner and came across some products with over 10,000 reviews and a good rating of >= 4.3. However, upon reviewing the ratings and reviews, I noticed a suspicious pattern involving positive mentions of a ""Demo person"" and the ""Demo of the product by \[insert some person's name\]"" rather than the product itself. Most of these 5 star and ""verified purchase"" reviews are like ""Good demo given by......"".

I mean if someone is subjectively reviewing some product on Amazon, they'd focus on the product, and not the experience they had with the ""demo person"". There are more than 10,000 reviews and mostly every other review is like this. They specifically mention the name of the ""person who provided demo"", like who even remembers such details like the name of service/demo personnel who visit our home??

There are hundreds, if not thousands of reviews like this. I noticed some of these profiles, and they had entire review as their username itself, which further raises some red flags. I have provided some examples below and the link of this product. Few days ago I was looking for Dishwashers, and noticed the same pattern there as well. To summarize;

* **Strange Review Pattern:** Many verified purchase reviews focus on praising a person who gave a demo of the product, rather than discussing the product's performance.
* **Frequent Name Mentions:** Reviews repeatedly mention the demo person by name, which seems unusual for genuine product feedback. A normal user won't even take out that much time to praise the demo experience in form of a review on Amazon.
* **Volume of Such Reviews:** This pattern is not limited to a few reviews—there are hundreds, if not thousands, of similar comments.
* The unusual focus on the demo experience and such peculiar details about the guy who gave the ""demo"" raises concerns about the authenticity of these reviews, especially since I’ve seen similar patterns in reviews for other products like Dishwashers.
* **Consumer Concern:** Reliance on reviews for purchase decisions becomes problematic if such practices are widespread.

Could anyone clarify what might be happening here?

Here is link to the product: ([Link](https://www.amazon.in/ECOVACS-Powerful-Advanced-Navigation-Technology/dp/B0D17XGQX7/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=2LCVZSUZTTEAO&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.0kND2LTZx-OW4a10YfgXj8Z8lt9byENFFz_cMeFk2-nhtcCcv3urxLZ5b5hy_n2nr9hkQwu9yJUW4G8HpFYm-h0idfQt4CcVTYqdwx8dl5fqsdsNVCXZRegnvpuJSJ5L37tYWENS3u7UAWzBXAnm7MNAXRmwNxUMGMtJx07WUQZHXhU90AL_0KmdQUmga8EtCglV_b-_cuXt0gjf97hvQA_ZswTJI6_NG9m625a41h0.j81fkX41_GBE8pYdJ5GKSWhWQ6fA9nSjdetecbYu-eE&dib_tag=se&keywords=ecovacs%2Bdeebot%2By1%2Bpro&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1737748947&sprefix=ecovac%2Caps%2C259&sr=8-1-spons&sp_csd=d2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY&th=1))

To buy a flagship or not,Lucifer0008,3,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GadgetsIndia/comments/1i9lohw/to_buy_a_flagship_or_not/,"So I'm in market for new phone rn

Due to past experiences, im limiting myself to motorola, pixel and samsung (non Exynos) models only.

Budget isn't a constraint, so im confused as to which one to buy. 

My use case is going to be mostly daily driving, with lots of camera, social media and content streaming. I also want to use the device for video creation. Might as well do light editing work on the phone.

Now, I'm very used to the clean UI motorola provides and anything other than that is just a downgrade to me. I don't know which phone should I go for...

Moto 50 fusion: Is an amazing phone, but lacks that premium phone look 

Pixel 8 : tensor G3 underperforming it's genarations counterparts which consuming more battery seems like a compromise 

Pixel 9 : again the chip underperforming compared to snapdragon gen 3 feels like leaving value for money on the table 

S24 : unless I go for ultra, it's not worth it

S25 : a good option but I want to get something now and it's too new and untested in real world long term sense."

1. Is the S25 worth it at this price, or are there better Samsung models with better deals that I should consider?

ZEBRONICS BLITZ C Headphone,ameen_221b,1,3,https://amzn.in/d/e8JwDe9,"Worst Headset for BGMI & Battle Royale Games

Rating: 1/5 stars

Avoid the Zebronics Blitz C headset if you're a serious BGMI or battle royale game player. The microphone quality is extremely poor, with a walkie-talkie-like sound that makes communication with teammates nearly impossible.

The audio quality is equally disappointing, lacking clarity and depth. You'll struggle to pinpoint enemy movements or hear crucial game sounds.

To make matters worse, Zebronics has a strict no-return policy, even if the product is defective or doesn't meet expectations. Be aware that you won't be able to return or exchange this headset.

Save your money and invest in a better-quality gaming headset from a reputable brand with a reasonable return policy."

Will mostly use it as a data storage by putting it in a enclosure for now but will later install it in a laptop. 

Having DRAM, SLC/TLC caching in that price point is the main reason to consider this, I see no other in my price range.

There are several issues reported online with adata putting cheaper controller or dram in this device.

If someone could share the maker details for controller and dram of this SSD you bought recently in India, it would be of great help. Also please mention where you bought it from.

This is Nord 4 detailed review,InformalPublic2941,66,12,https://i.redd.it/u9o6ddi9lwee1.jpeg,"For people who are confused about this phone 
I will try to explain about this phone. Point by point.
[Build quality]- phone feels premium while holding looks very good because of its metal body design. It has got alert slider very usefull it has got nfc and it blaster too.
[Haptics and speaker]- haptics are very good well integrated with system. Speakers are good i will say.
[Display]- Display is good with good colours and is sharp with its 1.5k display (but problem is I feel hbm could be better brightness should have been more)
Performance and ui - performance is good for price I will say and ui is very smooth with good animations but I have noticed one thing is that this phone tends to kill background app. I hope it gets fixed.
Camera- camera is good not the best in the segment there are other phones if u want phone specially for camera still it is good photos are sharp.selfie is average or above average. And there is no macro lense.
[BATTERY]- battery is really good first i thought battery was draining fast but after using it got optimised.
In short if u can get this phone under 25k it's worth the money it's a total package it's allrounder phone."
