"Only use the same brand and same size of ram sticks together. Mix and match won’t work, or if it somehow did all your ram will be the speed and size of the slowest/smallest in the system. Also don’t place them right next to each other leave one space free between the ram sticks unless you have enough of the same ram to fill all slots. Look at your motherboard manual for confirmation but usually closest to the CPU and third from cpu for two ram sticks.

TLDR: remove both old 8gb sticks and replace with new 16gb sticks leave one slot free between the new ones.

Edit: after you put in new ram sticks your pc might take a couple minutes to start first time because the ram sticks have to be trained the first time after that everything should start quick.",use brand size ram stick together mix match wont work somehow ram speed size slowestsmallest system also dont place right next leave one space free ram stick unless enough ram fill slot look motherboard manual confirmation usually closest cpu third cpu two ram stick tldr remove old gb stick replace new gb stick leave one slot free new one edit put new ram stick pc might take couple minute start first time ram stick trained first time everything start quick

The problem though is that latency is based off of actual rendered frames. So lets say you are playing a game at 40 FPS in 4k max settings. Sure...you can turn on DLSS and get 160 FPS...but the response / latency is going to feel a little sluggish. I think in certain titles (especially single player games) it won't matter a ton...but in anything competitive...you aren't going to want DLSS on.,problem though latency based actual rendered frame let say playing game fps k max setting sureyou turn dlss get fpsbut response latency going feel little sluggish think certain title especially single player game matter tonbut anything competitiveyou going want dlss

Yes, it’s possible to capture your PC screen to your Honor tablet and stream from the tablet, even with an underpowered PC. Here’s a concise breakdown of practical methods:

—

### **Best Options**  
#### 1. **HDMI Capture Card (Wired, Most Reliable)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Connect your PC’s HDMI output to a USB capture card (e.g., Elgato Cam Link, Magewell, or budget-friendly options like UGREEN).  
     - Plug the capture card into your tablet via USB-OTG.  
   - **Tablet Setup**:  
     - Use an Android app like **USB Camera Pro** or **Larix Broadcaster** to read the HDMI feed.  
     - Stream directly via apps like **Streamlabs Mobile** or **PRISM Live**.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Low latency, high quality.  
     - Offloads encoding to the tablet (Snapdragon 6 Gen1 handles it well).  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires purchasing a capture card (~$50–$150).  

#### 2. **NDI over Network (Wireless, Free/Software-Based)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Install **OBS Studio + NDI Plugin** on your PC.  
     - Use **NDI HX Camera** (Android app) to receive the NDI feed on your tablet.  
     - Stream via **Larix Broadcaster** or similar apps.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - No extra hardware.  
     - Good for moderate-quality streaming.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Requires a strong Wi-Fi network (5 GHz recommended).  
     - Slightly higher latency.  

#### 3. **RTMP Restreaming (Advanced)**  
   - **How it works**:  
     - Use OBS on your PC to stream to a local RTMP server (e.g., **Restream.io** or a self-hosted server).  
     - Use the tablet to pick up the RTMP feed and rebroadcast it.  
   - **Pros**:  
     - Flexible, no hardware needed.  
   - **Cons**:  
     - Complex setup; relies on PC encoding (may strain an underpowered PC).  

—

### **Other Ideas**  
- **Screen Mirroring + Tablet Capture** (e.g., **Splashtop**, **scrcpy**):  
  - Mirror the PC screen to the tablet, then use screen-recording apps.  
  - **Limitations**: Android often blocks app-based screen capture for DRM/security reasons.  

—

### **Verdict**  
- **Recommended**: **HDMI Capture Card** for reliability and quality.  
- **Budget Option**: **NDI** if your network is strong.  

Your idea isn’t stupid—it’s a smart workaround for offloading streaming from a weak PC. The Snapdragon 6 Gen1 in your Honor tablet can handle encoding, especially at 720p/1080p. Test with free tools like NDI first, but invest in a capture card for long-term use.

"Ebay is usually the easiest. I've been selling used parts on there..pretty much since it started. But be advised - you're going to lose ~15% to fees (especially if you promote your listings). 

And buyers can also be a bit of a pain-in-the-ass. I've not yet had someone try to scam me on returns, but I have had plenty of people that will make a last minute bid, win an auction, and then minutes later send me a message asking me to cancel the sale - that they just placed a bid ""to see if they could win"". 

I also really don't like that they moved to their own payment system rather than using paypal. I totally get WHY they did this, but in the past, I didn't pull the money out of paypal until the return window had closed. Now in-order to avoid being classified as a bank, Ebay sends your payout (less fees) almost immediately. 

Also be aware that ALL of the benefit of the doubt is on the buyer and that buyer protection (naturally) is heavily biased towards any issues the buyer may have, whether-or-not it has anything to do with you or the item you've sold. 

Customer buys a used motherboard that is DDR2 only and they expected to be able to use DDR3? Guess what - they will probably initiate a return, saying that your listing didn't reflect what they received, and you're going to end up eating the shipping cost to them, and sometimes eating the shipping cost to return it. HOPEFULLY if they return it, they'll properly package it before sending it back. But given that shit happens sometimes, if you send an item out, the customer decides to return it (even if it's legitimate reasons), and it gets smashed by the USPS, you're probably going to eat all of it - cost to ship to customer, cost to ship back to you. And getting a payout on USPS insurance isn't easy (if there IS any insurance). USPS loses the item? Even with insurance? If everything worked as it should, the CUSTOMER is the one that should be going to USPS and filing a claim that they lost the item you shipped. But chances are they'll complain to ebay, and ebay will do a 100% refund which will pull right out of your bank. 

Also some buyers will make really weird claims about the condition of the item, but will classify the feedback as positive, so that you have no recourse to get it removed. I had one guy say that I damaged the USB ports on a motherboard that I shipped to them. I know this was flat out un-true, but because it was a positive feedback, I couldn't challenge it. Same thing with a surface tablet that I sold - I had a tempered glass screen protector on it from about five minutes after I bought it, to the last moment before I took the picture to put it up for sale. I then got a ""positive"" feedback that said I lied about the condition of the screen and that it had a deep scratch right in the center. But again - it was ""positive"" feedback, so I couldn't challenge it. It's really weird, and I do NOT understand why people do this. 

Anyway.. this may all sound like I don't like selling on ebay, but that's not true. For the most part, it's a really good way to get rid of old parts for which you have no more use. Additionally, some hardware sells for a lot more than you may expect. If you've got hardware that is several generations old, for instance, there is a surprising market for ""retro battlestations"" and hardware that is still operating. I sold some old DDR1 RAM a while ago. Is it going to sell as much as it did new? Of course not. But it sold for like $20, which is more than the $0 I would have gotten if I had sent it to tech recycling (which is what I was previously planning on doing).",ebay usually easiest selling used part therepretty much since started advised going lose fee especially promote listing buyer also bit painintheass yet someone try scam return plenty people make last minute bid win auction minute later send message asking cancel sale placed bid see could win also really like moved payment system rather using paypal totally get past pull money paypal return window closed inorder avoid classified bank ebay sends payout less fee almost immediately also aware benefit doubt buyer buyer protection naturally heavily biased towards issue buyer may whetherornot anything item sold customer buy used motherboard ddr expected able use ddr guess probably initiate return saying listing reflect received going end eating shipping cost sometimes eating shipping cost return hopefully return properly package sending back given shit happens sometimes send item customer decides return even legitimate reason get smashed usps probably going eat cost ship customer cost ship back getting payout usps insurance easy insurance usps loses item even insurance everything worked customer one going usps filing claim lost item shipped chance complain ebay ebay refund pull right bank also buyer make really weird claim condition item classify feedback positive recourse get removed one guy say damaged usb port motherboard shipped know flat untrue positive feedback could challenge thing surface tablet sold tempered glass screen protector five minute bought last moment took picture put sale got positive feedback said lied condition screen deep scratch right center positive feedback could challenge really weird understand people anyway may sound like like selling ebay true part really good way get rid old part use additionally hardware sell lot may expect got hardware several generation old instance surprising market retro battlestations hardware still operating sold old ddr ram ago going sell much new course sold like would gotten sent tech recycling previously planning

"Hi,

Does Undervolting/Powerlimiting affects performance ?",hi undervoltingpowerlimiting affect performance
Doesn’t really matter. My gpu wasn’t overclocked and was pulling 335 watts. You’re looking at 225 watts total available power after factoring in ONLY your gpu. I don’t think 225 watts is enough headroom before for any kind of gaming.,doesnt really matter gpu wasnt overclocked pulling watt youre looking watt total available power factoring gpu dont think watt enough headroom kind gaming
"It *CAN* but it doesn't necessarily have to. 

Power limiting the CPU will probably reduce some performance, but nothing that you're likely to notice. I would guess at MOST you'd lose 2%. And probably not even that much. More likely is that you won't lose any performance because in gaming, the CPU isn't likely to pull its full 148W. The power limitation will just prevent it in the case that it DOES want to do so. 

As for under-volting, this one is a bit harder to explain. The main thing to keep in-mind about it is that there is absolutely no risk to the hardware by attempting to under-volt (as opposed to increasing voltage to get a more stable overclock - that DEFINITELY has a risk of damage). 

Under-volting can be thought of as a weird mix of power restricting *AND* overclocking. The way the graphics card operates, the graphics card will increase its clockspeed automatically (AKA boosting or dynamic overclocking). This is built into the graphics card itself (the founder's edition 2080 Ti, for instance, ran at a base clockspeed of 1350MHz with a boost clockspeed of 1635MHz). 

Now with the automatic clockspeed boosting, the card basically says, ""for [x] amount of clockspeed, increase the voltage intake by [y]."" Some folks will then manually overclock the card, but as they manually overclock it without under-volting (or sometimes over-volting), that causes the power limiter to kick in and the card is like, ""Nope. Not doing that.""

Under-volting, then, creates a voltage curve that basically says, ""run at [x] clockspeed with [z] voltage"" (where [z]) is a lower value than the default. If you keep the clockspeed values the same as default, it's possible to reduce the voltage being fed to the card. The GPU designer, wanting to ensure max stability, will often err on the higher-end of voltages, while not so high that it starts to cause damage. So what ends up happening is that the card takes more power than it really NEEDS, but the engineers know that the GPU will run stable. If you under-volt it, you CAN start to run into some instability (but again - NO risk of damage. If you start to have crashes or whatnot, you can just remove the under-volt settings and try again). 

So it's actually *POSSIBLE* that by under-volting, and manually overclocking, you can actually achieve MORE performance than if you ran the card stock. But silicon lottery being a thing (i.e. some computer chips overclock better than others), this is never guaranteed. 

Most of the time, however, under-volting is generally about power savings. I'm not sure how well the 2080 Ti under-volts, the RTX 3000-series (and especially the RTX 3080) was where under-volting became really a thing. I was able to retain my stock clockspeed (AKA no performance loss), and drop the power usage by about 10%. 

Now it follows that if you (generally) need more voltage to achieve higher clockspeeds, if you LOWER clockspeeds, you would also need less voltage. But this is where the performance loss can come in (hence - under-volting CAN result in performance loss, but it doesn't necessarily have to). 

The 10% power savings was good, but I wanted to reduce the power consumption further, as it was getting hot as balls in my office in the middle of summer, and I was willing to accept a small loss in performance in order to reduce the heat output from my computer. In all, I was able to drop my performance by about 6% by lowering the clockspeed, but I was able to achieve a rock solid (i.e. no artifacts or crashing) power reduction of *almost 40%* (from 378W at peak, down to as low as 210W). And for what it's worth, not that I care, but my graphics card temperatures dropped from 84C under load to a max of about 62C. 

Yes, there was some performance loss, but to give you a bit of a wider view as to how little that mattered, I was gaming at 4K/60 at the time, and a 6% loss in performance meant that my FPS dropped from about 74 FPS in the games I was playing, down to about 69 FPS.

"The person that told you that is both right and wrong. 

According to the [specs page](https://rog.asus.com/us/motherboards/rog-strix/rog-strix-b450-f-gaming-model/spec/), there are 3x M.2 ports on the board. The one closest to the CPU has its own CPU lanes. The second shares CPU lanes with the graphics card slot. The third is attached to the chipset. 

Using the secondary M.2 port will actually cause the graphics card slot to run in X8 mode, which cuts its bandwidth in-half. This may-or-may-not matter, depending on which graphics card you're using, but in-general it should be avoided. 

Using the third M.2 port will cause SATA ports 5&6 to be disabled. Additionally, this M.2 port shares PCIe3 bandwidth with other devices in your system (i.e. networking, sound card, etc). 

SO - to answer the question. If you're using the secondary M.2 port, the M.2 itself will run at full speed, but the graphics card may not. 

If you're using the third M.2 port, it has to share its bandwidth with the rest of the machine, so there *MAY* (emphasis: **MAY**) be a slight decline in speed in situations where the chipset uplink gets clogged (though this is pretty unlikely). 

The proximity to the CPU itself has nothing to do with it, but the primary M.2 port is the one you would want to use because it's the one that has its own dedicated lanes.

But all that said, if you move it, the chances of you noticing *ANY* difference is pretty remote.",person told right wrong according spec pagehttpsrogasuscomusmotherboardsrogstrixrogstrixbfgamingmodelspec x port board one closest cpu cpu lane second share cpu lane graphic card slot third attached chipset using secondary port actually cause graphic card slot run x mode cut bandwidth inhalf mayormaynot matter depending graphic card using ingeneral avoided using third port cause sata port disabled additionally port share pcie bandwidth device system ie networking sound card etc answer question using secondary port run full speed graphic card may using third port share bandwidth rest machine may emphasis may slight decline speed situation chipset uplink get clogged though pretty unlikely proximity cpu nothing primary port one would want use one dedicated lane said move chance noticing difference pretty remote
"It only matters in 1 of 2 scenarios:

1: if one slot is faster than the other (newer PCIe gen version)

Or

2: if it halves the lanes of your GPU (see manual)

Both doesn't seem to apply here, but it varies from motherboard to motherboard",matter scenario one slot faster newer pcie gen version half lane gpu see manual seem apply varies motherboard motherboard
Maybe. Your M.2 slots probably do have different speeds/generation. Consult your motherboard manual. But yes usually the slot closest to the CPU is the fastest. But also make sure your M.2 drive is the same generation. Older generations will work it’ll just run at the slower speed.,maybe slot probably different speedsgeneration consult motherboard manual yes usually slot closest cpu fastest also make sure drive generation older generation work itll run slower speed
"Only reason that would matter is if you were using your chipset bandwidth (USB/SATA) on something else, since the one near the CPU has direct access, otherwise it makes no difference.",reason would matter using chipset bandwidth usbsata something else since one near cpu direct access otherwise make difference
"The slot closest to the CPU talks directly to the CPU.

The further away ports normally operate off the south bridge which means it is shared bandwidth which could possibly be slower.

However there are few interesting things that make me thing that is not the case.

    When the M.2_2 is occupied by M.2 device, PCIe x16_1 will run at x8 mode.
    PCIe x16_3 slot shares bandwidth with PCIe x1_2 and PCIe x1_3.
    Expansion Slots
    2 x PCIe 3.0/2.0 x16 (x16 or x8/x4)
    1 x PCIe 2.0 x16 (max at x4 mode) *1

"MT/s is twice MHz.  DDR = dual data rate, so you get 2 memory reads per clock cycle.  So if the memory is running at 1600 Mhz, that is 3200 MT/s.  If you are getting 2667 MT/s, your memory is running at 1333 MHz.

You actually see MT/s all the time - that is generally what memory speeds are advertised at.  DDR5-6000 is 6000 MT/s with a 3000 MHz clock speed.

">Most of the benchmarks I can find either only focus on 1080p gaming or don't list many if at all of the 5000-series CPUs I'm interested in.

They use 1080p (often with a GPU that isn't useful for 1080p gaming) to force the limitation on the CPU to get results that are CPU limited. So the way i'd look at it is if you upgrade your GPU later on with the CPU you end up buying, it can give you an increase in performance, but only up to the point you become CPU limited.

Unless you're planning on going with a HFR (120hz+) monitor in your near future before you'd upgrade past AM4, I would stick with the 5600G and see if its enough. used CPUs tend to get pretty cheap if they're not among the best in their socket. Could easily see a 5700x dropping below $100 usd used before too long and then you could get the upgrade simply when you can use it (and for less).",benchmark find either focus p gaming list many series cpu interested use p often gpu useful p gaming force limitation cpu get result cpu limited way id look upgrade gpu later cpu end buying give increase performance point become cpu limited unless planning going hfr hz monitor near future would upgrade past would stick g see enough used cpu tend get pretty cheap among best socket could easily see x dropping usd used long could get upgrade simply use less

"Ok. A few things. First, assuming you're referring to the CPU burning issues, the issue you're referring to wasn't just Asus. It was all of them, because AMD wasn't conservative enough with the maximum voltages for the 7800X3D, and motherboard manufacturers thought AMD WAS being conservative, so they allowed even more voltage to flow into the CPU from there. In fairness, Asus was the worst for this particular issue because they allowed the most over-voltage to flow, and their response to the problem was BY FAR the worst of any manufacturer.  But literally all motherboard manufacturers got SOME of this problem. But Asus' poor public response is why this is commonly referred to as the ""Asus burning CPU issue"", and that drives me slightly nuts - Asus deserves a fair amount of shit for the way they handle their RMAs. But they don't really deserve to be thought of as the primary driver for this particular problem. 

Background aside, this hasn't been a thing for like almost two years. And even then, it was a pretty short thing when it was an issue. And even then, it was only an issue for X3D CPUs. 

Just be sure to update your BIOS after you get everything up-and-running and you'll be fine. This really isn't critical - even if you have an X3D CPU, the likelihood that the BIOS hasn't been updated to fix the over-voltage is pretty low. And even in the (extremely) unlikely event that you got a motherboard with a BIOS that is over two years old, and you have an X3D CPU, it's not an issue for initial powerup and setup. There is no need to do it via BIOS flashback. 

Just make sure that a BIOS update is the first thing you do when you get to the BIOS screen, and you'll be fine.",ok thing first assuming referring cpu burning issue issue referring asus amd conservative enough maximum voltage xd motherboard manufacturer thought amd conservative allowed even voltage flow cpu fairness asus worst particular issue allowed overvoltage flow response problem far worst manufacturer literally motherboard manufacturer got problem asus poor public response commonly referred asus burning cpu issue drive slightly nut asus deserves fair amount shit way handle rmas really deserve thought primary driver particular problem background aside thing like almost two year even pretty short thing issue even issue xd cpu sure update bios get everything upandrunning fine really critical even xd cpu likelihood bios updated fix overvoltage pretty low even extremely unlikely event got motherboard bios two year old xd cpu issue initial powerup setup need via bios flashback make sure bios update first thing get bios screen fine

"Asus is really kind of a mixed bag. Their designs can be quite good. I quite like their ProArt line, and I like some of the ROG STRIX line. 

I *HATE* some of the branding crap they put on their boards. I have an Asus B650E-F, and while I didn't *plan* on using a chassis with a window, the fucking cringe shit that they put on the southbridge cooler guaranteed that would happen. Seriously the following cringe shit is printed on the southbridge cooler:

> ROG-branded products always promise you absolute leading performance for those keen on winning power. Innovative user controls deliver true game-ruling innovation. 

What a friggin' joke. 

All of that said, I otherwise like the board, and it was the right choice for the time.

What I really don't like about Asus is that they have a bit of a brand tax going. The B850-F, for instance, currently sells for $299 on PCPP. for that same $299, you could get a superior MSI X870E Tomahawk, get mostly the same specs, but pickup 5GbE. Or you could save $100 and go with an Asrock B850 Steel Legend and the only significant loss is one M.2 port running in PCIe4 (as opposed to the Asus' PCIe5). 

Beyond that, Asus' RMA support is legendarily crap. Their SOP seems to be simply:

Step 1 - Blame the customer's non-Asus branded hardware. If the customer's other hardware *cannot* be at fault, proceed to step 2. 

Step 2 - Blame the customer themselves for improper installation or operation. If improper installation or operation *cannot* be at fault, proceed to step 3.

"Assuming the power supply is adequate, sure.  That is kind of the standard ""upgrade"" versus ""build a whole new computer.""  I try to get as much longevity as I can out of a case and PSU.

When you change out MB, CPU, and RAM, and then boot off the existing OS disk, it is going to have to identify all of that new hardware and install drivers, so make sure you have network drivers for your new system pre-downloaded and on your hard drive, so you can update them if the PC won't connect to the internet.

Also, Windows will require re-activation so have your existing license key handy.

What are the *exact* DIMMs you have and what are you looking at buying? Full specs...

>I am not sure what single rank and dual rank mean, if you could please clarify.

DIMMs are physically arranged into either single-rank or dual-rank. it's how the actual memory chips are connected to something called a chip select line. Having more ranks per channel improves performance by allowing something called interleaving, but the more ranks you have the harder it is to run the memory.

Ranks should be in the specifications for the module, but some manufacturers don't specify it and have multiple SKUs under one type of kit. Corsair are notorious for this with their LPX kits... The specs printed on a module sometimes list the ranks like 2r8 (dual rank) or 1r8. CPUz will tell you how many ranks each DIMM has for DDR4.

With Ryzen 5000, two ranks per channel (so two single-rank DIMMs per channel) pretty much always works at 3600 MT/s provided the sticks have compatible XMP profiles. Three ranks per channel works more often than not, four ranks per channel is much harder to run.",yes mhz kit mt run mhz timing transfer rate though spec probably list timing profile like similar exact dimms looking buying full spec sure single rank dual rank mean could please clarify dimms physically arranged either singlerank dualrank actual memory chip connected something called chip select line rank per channel improves performance allowing something called interleaving rank harder run memory rank specification module manufacturer specify multiple skus one type kit corsair notorious lpx kit spec printed module sometimes list rank like r dual rank r cpuz tell many rank dimm ddr ryzen two rank per channel two singlerank dimms per channel pretty much always work mt provided stick compatible xmp profile three rank per channel work often four rank per channel much harder run

It does not.

CPU takes its power from the motherboard. The motherboard takes its power from 24 pin ATX cable (the thick one) and EPS cable (4 ou 8 pin).

It's not absolutely necessary. The second CPU power cable (aka EPS) is usually not needed unless you're gonna be a hardcore overclocker.

>I have the WD_Black that doesn’t use Sata correct?

Just so we're clear, CPU power cable is not PCI-E. They can both be 8 pin but they are not interchangeable and dont fit the same slot.

Also, for the GPU, you need 2 separate *cables*, even if one cable has 2x PCI-E plugs in them, you still need to use 2 different cables (to split the power between them).

"An i3-9100 paired with an RTX 3050 is a pretty slow setup for gaming.

I think benchmarks are showing you'll get a 70-something percent improvement so it's up to you whether that's worth the price tag or not.

Doesn't hurt to at least try and see how it all behaves. You can always return it since you're buying it locally. It's a pretty significant upgrade in terms of performance, but it's also quite a chunk of money as well.

There is a limiting factor with VRAM, in that if a game does require more than 16 GB, the majority of cards out there will struggle to run it.

I watched a comparison video just yesterday between the 7700x and the 7600x. The video was maybe a year or two old, but it was only putting the 7700x ahead by 5-7% but the 7600x was still performing great.

He found that most games really just weren’t using the extra 2 cores.",resolution gpu x really close x watched comparison video yesterday x x video maybe year two old putting x ahead x still performing great found game really werent using extra core
"They're both valid.  I'd probably go with the 9700x.  While it's only about [2% faster](https://youtu.be/rlfTHCzBnnQ?t=1136), for a 6% price increase.  But if you look at the overall system (say $1k) cost $20 for 2% more is pretty good.",theyre valid would probably go x fasterhttpsyoutuberlfthczbnnqt price increase look overall system say k cost pretty good
"They will perform basically the same, and that's reflected in the price.  You may as well go w the newer chip because the difference in price is minimal.  The real alternative would be something much cheaper like 7600 if that's all you need for gaming and save the money for a better GPU.",perform basically reflected price may well go w newer chip difference price minimal real alternative would something much cheaper like need gaming save money better gpu
My resolution is is 1440p and gpu is 3070Ti,resolution p gpu ti
I updated my comment. But it still applies. Might be better saving a few bucks with the 7600x.,updated comment still applies might better saving buck x
Alright cool thank you! With me going up to am5 I have a 650Watt psu. Would the pairing of the 7600x and the 3070ti require a psu with higher wattage? Or should I be okay with this paring?,alright cool thank going watt psu would pairing x ti require psu higher wattage okay paring
Put the build into PC parts picker and look at the expected wattage. Zach’s Tech Turf on YouTube recommends adding 30% to that wattage. Seems like a good rule to follow.,put build pc part picker look expected wattage zachs tech turf youtube recommends adding wattage seems like good rule follow

"there may be a very small handful of games that at ultra settings with everything cranked up they need more than 16gb vram. And there will be more games over the next 5 years like that.

But a 5080 will beat a 3090 like 99% of the time at 4k.

Edit: 12gb not enough at some settings [https://youtu.be/Fbg7ChsjmEA?t=390](https://youtu.be/Fbg7ChsjmEA?t=390) so either the 5080 will beat the 3090 100% of the time or it just won't run if we get a game that demands over 16gb vram at perhaps some resolution over 4K (multiple monitors maybe). So a 5080 will basically beat a 3090 like 99.99% of the time.

All you'd have to do for the 5080 is turn down settings to keep the vram use below 16gb. A 3090 would probably be getting like 15fps in the situations where a game demands over 16gb vram so that's kind of pointless to play at.",may small handful game ultra setting everything cranked need gb vram game next year like beat like time k edit gb enough setting httpsyoutubefbgchsjmeathttpsyoutubefbgchsjmeat either beat time run get game demand gb vram perhaps resolution k multiple monitor maybe basically beat like time would turn setting keep vram use gb would probably getting like fps situation game demand gb vram kind pointless play

"Something I think the VRAM doomers miss out on is that benchmarks aren't realistic use cases because they are trying to get the objective performance.

For actually gaming, who is opposing DLSS upscaling? DLSS quality would perform slightly worse than 1440p native, but much better than the VRAM and performance requirements of 4k native benchmarks. Meanwhile, the upscaling leader DLSS has usually been [trading blows (year-old video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5B_dqi_Syc) depending on the game compared to 4k native, and its not going to get any worse.

The concern is that DLSS is the metaphorical lipstick on the pig to cover up the optimization devs should be doing, but I don't see that leaving a 5080 owner saying ""I literally can't play my games on my TV"". I'd expect any game running that poorly to outright flop for performance issues.",something think vram doomers miss benchmark realistic use case trying get objective performance actually gaming opposing dlss upscaling dlss quality would perform slightly worse p native much better vram performance requirement k native benchmark meanwhile upscaling leader dlss usually trading blow yearold videohttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvobdqisyc depending game compared k native going get worse concern dlss metaphorical lipstick pig cover optimization devs see leaving owner saying literally play game tv would expect game running poorly outright flop performance issue

The 1% is likely very high, it's perhaps .1% of the time or maybe like 1-2 games. It probably requires a resolution over 4K to be a concern because it'd probably only be for non ray traced games at ultra settings. But we may get a game where the 16gb on a card causes it to fail at certain settings like how these 12gb cards couldn't handle it in the test above.

Could I name a game where the 3090 will beat a 5080? No. Does it exist? Perhaps it doesn't even exist except in such ridiculous circumstances that basically noone has to worry.

It is, but there are usually motherboards that offer the same for less, as ASUS TUF is quite a popular (and therefor overpriced) brand. ASRock generally has great value boards in many markets, as has MSI. Which country are you in, and do you need wifi/bluetooth?

> As for the GPU i think i'll stay with this one because it has ray-tracing.

A 4060 won't be fast enough for proper raytracing anyway, it's simply a slow card. AMD is pretty bad at raytracing technologically, but because AMD cards at the same price are much faster raytracing performance isn't that bad in most games.

"Something to consider about cases ...

Cases from 7 years ago tend to have limited support for AIOs at best. And most of those have challenges when using them. So if you are looking at using an AIO, you'll want to take that into consideration.

Additionally ... the newer cases will have lots of quality-of-life features that make building and cable management much easier as well as better airflow, which is going to be important for cooling the very hot components that we have these days. I recently did a similar task (upgrading the guts) for my nephews build in his old case ... fitting even a 240mm AIO was a challenge. Several months later, we swapped out the case and the new one was much, much easier when it came to ease of building. And easily supported a 360mm AIO.

As for PSUs ... it depends on the PSU, its wattage, its efficiency, and its warranty. If it has enough wattage and is still under warranty, definitely consider continuing to use it. There are PSUs out there with 10 year warranties.

And you can always upgrade these later when you have more cash, especially if they meet your needs at this time.",something consider case case year ago tend limited support aios best challenge using looking using aio want take consideration additionally newer case lot qualityoflife feature make building cable management much easier well better airflow going important cooling hot component day recently similar task upgrading gut nephew build old case fitting even mm aio challenge several month later swapped case new one much much easier came ease building easily supported mm aio psus depends psu wattage efficiency warranty enough wattage still warranty definitely consider continuing use psus year warranty always upgrade later cash especially meet need time

"Yeah the 5700G is an APU so when they list ""AMD Radeon"" Graphics Card I'm guessing it's the on board GPU from the CPU. Meaning there is no actual physical graphics card in that PC and it won't run very well for most games.

Also the 5700G is AM4 socket which isn't necessarily bad but it will be outdated soon as AMD are no longer creating AM4 processors. Having said that your budget kind of restricts you to AM4.

Also I'd say 512gb storage isn't enough and I'd want 1tb which would do you well.

And 32gb ram would be much better than 16gb without a massive price difference.

Personally, with a budget of $1000 CAD there's not a great deal you could get new and I'd say if you're gonna buy a pre built just get a second hand one for this price. 

But honestly it's really not hard to build a PC yourself if you just use a youtube video. Pretty much all parts have the same process of installation so you wouldn't even need a video of somebody with your same parts.

If you are to build one, which would be best, I'd go something like a Ryzen 5 5600 with 32gb ram, and maybe something like an AMD RX 6600.

RAM is fine.

Since you have your machine open - drop in a 2TB NVME drive. Games are big now.

The PSU is not a problem, I've got a 1200W, so I'm not worried about that.

"Loading games is irrelevant, your games don't noticeably benefit from Gen5 NVMe compared to Gen3, or even Sata SSD for most situations. 

Transferring files from one drive to another is going to rely on the slower drive, meaning having a single Gen5 drive is pointless if all the other drives are slower. 

So unless you have sustained sequential workloads, or a niche requirement for high amounts of throughput, then I don't really see any benefit for Gen5. As such, if you really want Gen5, then any of them would work just fine and there isn't a ""best"" for you since the result is all the same.

I also don't have any context to your components, but you should check if the Gen5 M.2 slot on your motherboard shares any lanes with your GPU.

"Good questions! First it depends on the platform. I don’t know if it changed but when the AMD 7000 platform came out, using all 4 DIMM meant a significant reduction in data transfer rates - something like from 6000 to 3600. But sometimes you don’t really care about transfer rates and only need to handle large file or running multiple virtual machines. As far as I know intel didn’t had that limitation.

My intuition here is it to make sure each pair have their own “channel” (usually using alternating slots) and you the system will probably use the worst timing of the two sets. If you have time just test with a memory test - sometimes available directly in the bios - and analyze your needs : if you are going for gaming, 2x16 is probably enough. If you need to do more data driven heavy workload the go for the lot.",good question first depends platform dont know changed amd platform came using dimm meant significant reduction data transfer rate something like sometimes dont really care transfer rate need handle large file running multiple virtual machine far know intel didnt limitation intuition make sure pair channel usually using alternating slot system probably use worst timing two set time test memory test sometimes available directly bios analyze need going gaming x probably enough need data driven heavy workload go lot

"I think the games that he plays can help steer us with what upgrades you should look at first. 

With that said, I looked up the full specs on that PC.

With just a 128GB SSD, no games will fit on there. There's a 1TB HDD, but these drives are very slow.

Once consoles started coming out with SSDs by default, game development moved to assuming they're going to get that type of performance. A lot of modern games will choke trying to run off a hard drive.

You also mentioned a new PC for Christmas. So, let's look at upgrades that we can carry over to the new PC.

A 1TB SSD is pretty cost effective. There are two types. An NVME SSD - this looks like a stick of gum. And a SATA SSD. This is a 2.5"" little box, like half a stack of playing cards in size. The NVME drive is significantly faster, whereas the SATA SSD is old tech, but still much faster than a HDD.

I looked up the motherboard on this PC and it looks like there's just 1 NVME slot on this PC. It's in the upper right corner, next to the big bundle of cables (power). If it has something in there now, we can rule out using an NVME SSD, as this most likely has the operating system and will require additional steps and hardware to swap out. If it's empty, then it's free game. 

If that NVME slot is in use, if you look at the lower right corner of the motherboard, there's a metal plate. Inbetween that plate and the giant cable attached to the motherboard are two black plugs with an L inside them. These are SATA ports. One might be in use by a hard drive - it'll have a flat cable. You could add another SATA SSD and this upgrade could also move on to the new future PC.

This is probably the best glow-up you can give this PC.

For under $20, add another 1x 8GB stick of DDR4 ram. There are two physical types - one is for laptop and the other for desktop, so make sure you get one for desktop. In a perfect world, it's best to pair these as kits and get the same speed/brand. But eh. Not worth it for this use case.

And, without knowing what the plans are for future PC, that's as far as I'd go. A new graphics card would do wonders, but I don't see much point in getting one now if future PC one may have one that's much better.",think game play help steer u upgrade look first said looked full spec pc gb ssd game fit there tb hdd drive slow console started coming ssds default game development moved assuming going get type performance lot modern game choke trying run hard drive also mentioned new pc christmas let u look upgrade carry new pc tb ssd pretty cost effective two type nvme ssd look like stick gum sata ssd little box like half stack playing card size nvme drive significantly faster whereas sata ssd old tech still much faster hdd looked motherboard pc look like nvme slot pc upper right corner next big bundle cable power something rule using nvme ssd likely operating system require additional step hardware swap empty free game nvme slot use look lower right corner motherboard metal plate inbetween plate giant cable attached motherboard two black plug l inside sata port one might use hard drive flat cable could add another sata ssd upgrade could also move new future pc probably best glowup give pc add another x gb stick ddr ram two physical type one laptop desktop make sure get one desktop perfect world best pair kit get speedbrand eh worth use case without knowing plan future pc far would go new graphic card would wonder see much point getting one future pc one may one much better

"Nvidia recommends a minimum of 650 watts total system power ""based on a PC configured with a Ryzen 9 9950X processor"".

If the rest of your components are more power-hungry than normal then you need more, but otherwise 650 watts is enough. If you have a less power-hungry CPU, you might even be okay with less than 650.

Of course, you can get as much more than that as you want. This is just the minimum recommended.

>I've heard you should get a PSU that is 1.5x what you expect

The ""what you expect"" there is actual full load power consumption. What pcpartpicker tells you is a theoretical maximum and a rough estimate.

Just curious if there’s a specific reason for the 14900k?  I only ask because for gaming they seem to be overkill in all the wrong ways but if you do a lot of data work then it makes more sense. If you need the data performance just make sure you have the latest bios and patches for degradation and personally I would recommend a slight under volt since they seem to really push themselves to early deaths (and 100w more power usage than I’d like to see).,curious there specific reason k ask gaming seem overkill wrong way lot data work make sense need data performance make sure latest bios patch degradation personally would recommend slight volt since seem really push early death w power usage id like see

If you wanna go for a b450 rather look at the MSI variants as most of them do support Bios Flashback.

These boards are not exactly the cheapest but you will get the most for your money, at least from my perspective.

You will need more ram and honestly, I would rather go 32GB, as you share the memory with the IGPU. Ram speed should be 3600mhz as you will benefit from it in IGPU performance.

"Bios refers to a file that is and needs to be installed onto the motherboard itself to be able to use the newer processor. To update the Bios, you will need either have access to the bios while booting or a feature that is called bios flashback, a button to use an USB drive with the file, to update it.

This can be a hideous process, so rather go with a newer board that already supports it.

Older boards usually need a supported processor installed to get access to the bios. 

Many older boards don't have that button, which is why I said look for a MSI motherboard, if you want to go the bios update route on B450.

A520 refers to the chipset used on the MB, which is newer than the B450 and most likely will support the 5600g out of the box.

Other than that, you would be looking a passive cooled VRM (Voltage Regulator Module) that also uses a higher quality.

\----------

At this point I think you might be better of looking for a prebuilt system.",bios refers file need installed onto motherboard able use newer processor update bios need either access bios booting feature called bios flashback button use usb drive file update hideous process rather go newer board already support older board usually need supported processor installed get access bios many older board button said look msi motherboard want go bios update route b refers chipset used mb newer b likely support g box would looking passive cooled vrm voltage regulator module also us higher quality point think might better looking prebuilt system

Well the 9700x is better for gaming and the 12900k is a little better for multimedia tasks. For $30 more id get the better gaming cpu. Plus with an am5 system you will have room to upgrade in the future.

"You're heavily overpaying for some components, but you don't seem to be going for value. :)

While I usually don't advocate going AIO over aircooling, in such an aquarium style case which are really mostly built for AIOs I would just get a 360mm RGB aircooler, since that's actually cheaper than getting that Thermalright PS 120SE + 3 Arctic RGB fans.

The RGB RAM of that same kit is also cheaper, so I'd get that.

Lastly, since you are going to RGB, bear in mind that the bottom and side should be intake, so with those arctic fans you will be looking at the back of the frame. There are reverse blaade fans for that purpose, but they are a bit more expensive. Thermaltake sells a 3-pack.

You can also save some money on board, NVME and I did select a cheaper PSU, but you don't seem to be going for value. Nothing wrong with the components themselves.

"You're thinking of single rank vs dual rank (usually indeed visible by RAM chips being on one or two sides). At the same frequency and timings, dual rank is indeed faster as it allows for rank interleaving. The difference with DDR5 is rather small compared to DDR4 though.

This is absolute nonsense, 2x16GB is fine. Not only is the difference small, an X3D CPU will mitigate pretty much all differences in RAM performance anyway.

"DDR4 RAM is dirt cheap right now, and you could probably just get another 2x8GB of same model for pennies, to upgrade to 32 GB, unless your motherboard has only 2 RAM slots?

To upgrade CPU you'd have to upgrade motherboard and RAM too, so it would be big switch without really notable performance changes in gaming.

"This is a very common misconception - and one I myself fell victim too, only cleared that up couple months ago.

Most ""normal"" - consumer level main boards indeed don't have quad-channel support. But the number of sticks is not the same as number of channels. You can run two sticks as dual channel on dual channel board (which is most boards nowadays). You also can run 4 sticks as dual channel - it will just mean that you have 2 sticks per channel. Quad-channel would be running 4 sticks - each as separate channel - but again - quad-channel is mostly found in high end boards and mainly boards designed for server usage.

So in your case, whether you use 4 sticks or 2 sticks, it will be mostly irrelevant because it will run in dual channel either way. Just make sure that new RAM is similar to your current RAM - speed, latency etc. The best is to buy same sticks as you already have.",common misconception one fell victim cleared couple month ago normal consumer level main board indeed quadchannel support number stick number channel run two stick dual channel dual channel board board nowadays also run stick dual channel mean stick per channel quadchannel would running stick separate channel quadchannel mostly found high end board mainly board designed server usage case whether use stick stick mostly irrelevant run dual channel either way make sure new ram similar current ram speed latency etc best buy stick already

"for some context, the 2060 is an entry level card from 3 generations ago now. It was already anemic before the PS5 generation of consoles was released, so you really need to temper your expectations.

a 2060 is a 1080p 60FPS type of card, you will likely need to crank down the settings to get a decent framerate that is stable.

so for more context, the rough GPU equivalent to a base PS5 is the AMD 6700. Using average Timespy benchmark scores, we can get a rough idea of how the cards compare in non-raytraced games.

6700 has an average score of about 10600

2060 has an average score of about 7400

That means the base PS5 is roughly 40% more powerful than the 2060.

Most games on the PS5 use what is listed as the ""Medium"" option for their graphics settings when compared to the PC settings.

This does not mean you cant enjoy your games, you just need to adjust your expectations to what is capable with the hardware.",context entry level card generation ago already anemic p generation console released really need temper expectation p fps type card likely need crank setting get decent framerate stable context rough gpu equivalent base p amd using average timespy benchmark score get rough idea card compare nonraytraced game average score average score mean base p roughly powerful game p use listed medium option graphic setting compared pc setting mean cant enjoy game need adjust expectation capable hardware

"Yep that's good info, there's a lot of strange things about that pc, the ram issue is probably best fixed by reinstalling windows, you probably have a lot of bloatware installed.

Not having an ssd as the boot drive in 2025 is a crime, hdds aren't much cheaper except for much larger capacities these days anyway.

A i7-9700k is ok, but its not amazing these days.

A 2070 super is not the same thing as a 3070 super, a 2070 super is somewhat powerful, but it's getting a bit old, I wouldn't expect much more than med-low 1080p \~75fps in modern games with that. But the tech is off their rocker recommending an Intel Arc 770 as an upgrade, it's less powerful, and if that was within the last month or two outdated since intel released a new and much better generation.

The 2070 only running at 2.5GT/s is strange, the only way to get 2.5gt/s would be if you are running on pcie 2 which you shouldn't be, since your hardware is capable of pcie 3 (unless your motherboard isn't?), but since they mentioned the max speed was 8gt/s which is the max speed for pcie 2 it might be. Either way, if it is 2.5gb/s that is definitely slow, a modern card can use up to 32gt/s, and the 50 series will be able to do 64.

I would try reseating the GPU to see if you can get it to connect at a higher bandwidth, since that is likely the main cause of any underperforming. If that doesn't work, I would also try it in a another pcie slot if you have one. I would also get an anti sag bracket if that fixes it to prevent it in the future. (could make on instead of building, you could just use a stick of the right length if you were so inclined lol)",yep good info lot strange thing pc ram issue probably best fixed reinstalling window probably lot bloatware installed ssd boot drive crime hdds much cheaper except much larger capacity day anyway ik ok amazing day super thing super super somewhat powerful getting bit old would expect much medlow p fps modern game tech rocker recommending intel arc upgrade less powerful within last month two outdated since intel released new much better generation running gts strange way get gts would running pcie since hardware capable pcie unless motherboard since mentioned max speed gts max speed pcie might either way gb definitely slow modern card use gts series able would try reseating gpu see get connect higher bandwidth since likely main cause underperforming work would also try another pcie slot one would also get anti sag bracket fix prevent future could make instead building could use stick right length inclined lol

"No worries! 

I gotta admit, it's hard to definitively recommend one CPU over another, since the 7600(non x) is a pretty good performance for the cost, and I am confident you'd be happy with it. 

That said though, the x version has a slightly higher boost clock by default (gives approx. 5-7% higher performance on average as far as I can tell), and the x3D versions even higher than that again (for gaming that is - the x3D versions excels at single threaded gaming, but perform slightly worse typically for multi threading). 

Sidenote: typically the x versions of the CPUs don't come with a cooler, so be aware. I'd recommend a Thermalright Phantom Spirit anyway. 

If I were you, I'd definitely look up benchmarks for different CPUs in the games you play (youtube is great for this), that should help you decide. 

Apart from that it depends on how much you would be willing to put into it right now, or if you're thinking of upgrading in the near ish future. 

I have a 7700x that I've undervolted slightly, which performs about 10-20% better than the regular 7600 in most benchmarks I've seen - which for me is absolutely worth the slightly higher cost.",worry got admit hard definitively recommend one cpu another since non x pretty good performance cost confident would happy said though x version slightly higher boost clock default give approx higher performance average far tell xd version even higher gaming xd version excels single threaded gaming perform slightly worse typically multi threading sidenote typically x version cpu come cooler aware would recommend thermalright phantom spirit anyway would definitely look benchmark different cpu game play youtube great help decide apart depends much would willing put right thinking upgrading near ish future x undervolted slightly performs better regular benchmark seen absolutely worth slightly higher cost

"How did you install the RAM?

I had the same problem when building my 9600x-based system (did more or less the same upgrade you did). I had the same problem getting my Gigabyte B650 mobo booting. I got a light indicating a DRAM error.

Turns out, if you have 2 sticks of RAM, you have to install them in the 2nd and 4th slot outward from the CPU - not the 1st and 3rd as on the vast majority of board I've worked on since DDR1 first came out :-). This applies to your board as well, according to the manual.

If that doesn't help - Do a minimum viable configuration (CPU installed, 1 stick of RAM (in DIMM\_A2!), monitor hooked to the onboard GPU.  
Add parts one by one until you can't boot anymore

If the minimum config doesn't work, you can attempt to restore/update the BIOS with the Flashback feature - howto is described in the manual and [here](https://www.asus.com/support/faq/1038568/)

In addition, the board has some fan control bugs - they should be fixed in the v3067 BIOS. In any case, you should update to that version, as there are some performance improvements to be had as well...

By the way:  
Neither you nor the store actually has any way to know which BIOS is installed unless the board is booted up first, so updating the BIOS for that reason is still viable.

The board *does* run with a 9000, but only if the installed BIOS is new enough... It doesn't mean the board is updated from the store...",install ram problem building xbased system less upgrade problem getting gigabyte b mobo booting got light indicating dram error turn stick ram install nd th slot outward cpu st rd vast majority board worked since ddr first came applies board well according manual help minimum viable configuration cpu installed stick ram dimma monitor hooked onboard gpu add part one one boot anymore minimum config work attempt restoreupdate bios flashback feature howto described manual herehttpswwwasuscomsupportfaq addition board fan control bug fixed v bios case update version performance improvement well way neither store actually way know bios installed unless board booted first updating bios reason still viable board run installed bios new enough mean board updated store

My PSU supplied cable was marginally too short to reach the motherboard so I purchased a small extender cable ~150mm long.
Turns out the connectors used on this cable were making poor connection to the motherboard due to poor quality pin construciton. Whenever a heavy current load was being drawn the power would flip out and cause the BSOD.

"Oversimplify incoming, but hopefully gets the basic idea across:

 The reason the difference between the two CPUs would be more significant with higher-end GPUs or lower resolution is because, essentially, in any given game, a CPU has a maximum framerate it can do. This varies based on what’s happening in the game but for the most part, the elements that depend on the CPU aren’t as easy to scale up and down as the GPU-dependent stuff.

Whereas the GPU is much more tweakable - higher resolution, higher textures, post-processing effects, etc.

As long as the GPU’s max output at the settings and resolution you use is lower than what the 5800X3D can manage, you won’t see much difference between it and a faster CPU.

So say in a game the 5800X3D can manage 90fps, the 9800X3D can do 130, the 3080 can do 80, and the 5080 can do 120 (all totally made up numbers, not based on real performance). The 5800X3D and 3080 together will get 80fps, and upgrading to the 9800X3D wouldn’t do much. But the 5080 would get 90fps with the 5800X3D, and be able to do its full 120 with the 9800X3D.

And similarly, in the same game the 3080 might be able to manage, say, 110fps if you lowered the resolution, so in that case you’d also see a difference between the two CPUs.

Does that make sense?",oversimplify incoming hopefully get basic idea across reason difference two cpu would significant higherend gpus lower resolution essentially given game cpu maximum framerate varies based whats happening game part element depend cpu arent easy scale gpudependent stuff whereas gpu much tweakable higher resolution higher texture postprocessing effect etc long gpus max output setting resolution use lower xd manage wont see much difference faster cpu say game xd manage fps xd totally made number based real performance xd together get fps upgrading xd wouldnt much would get fps xd able full xd similarly game might able manage say fps lowered resolution case youd also see difference two cpu make sense

"You can talk about specs all day and resolutions and upgrade paths, but at the end of the day, the answer is ""it depends""

GPUs tend to be the most important thing for game performance, until the day that your CPU is holding you back. When your CPU is starting to give you problems, it'll usually present as really bad 1% lows, freezes, and hang ups. Depending on the game, you might see almost no performance increases by upgrading your CPU, and other games might benefit greatly. It's really hard to say without any examples. If you think your CPU is starting to show it's age, then going with like 9800X3D would be a better upgrade for you. But if you're more worried about running cyberpunk on ultra settings at a higher framerate than 50-60 frames and maybe flipping on RT, then perhaps you should consider 5080 while going to a 5700x3d if you think a little more juice on your CPU would help too.

I'm pushing back on the assertion that your 4080 Super is able to ""keep up"" paired with a 5700x3d.   It's should have come with a qualifier.  If it's good enough for you great, but like I said, depending on what you're playing you could be leaving way more than 10% performance on the table.

Would you recommend the GPU (Asus AIO 5090) or the CPU (9950X + ASUS 360MM AIO) at the front for intake?,would recommend gpu asus aio cpu x asus mm aio front intake
"GPU definitely at the top. 

First the GPU is 600 watts, so it's best to exhaust that heat straight out the case versus toasting every other PC part. 

Second top mount is ideal for AIOs because it enhances the lifespan because the pump is under the liquid. If the pump is over the liquid, then there's a chance the pump can run dry and fail. 

It's better to have a $2,000+ graphics card survive longer than a $200 AIO. 

Bottom AIO is the worst, and front mount is ok. 

The front AIO should ideally have the tubes on the bottom, but tubes are the top still works but might be a little louder. 

I don't recommend the 9950X here unless you have a very specific use case like VMs. 

The 9800X3D is the best for gaming, the 285K is the best for workstations, and the 9950X3D is about to come out as a middle ground.",gpu definitely top first gpu watt best exhaust heat straight case versus toasting every pc part second top mount ideal aios enhances lifespan pump liquid pump liquid chance pump run dry fail better graphic card survive longer aio bottom aio worst front mount ok front aio ideally tube bottom tube top still work might little louder recommend x unless specific use case like vms xd best gaming k best workstation xd come middle ground

"To rephrase this, 7600X is 98.5th percentile of best performance. 9800X3D is the 99.9/100th. They are both some of the best performing CPUs compared to all, and unless you have a GPU that is also in the 90th+ percentile of fastest cards that exist you shouldn't worry about it. 4070 Ti Super is not the upper limit of video cards, and will not be limited at all.",rephrase x th percentile best performance xd th best performing cpu compared unless gpu also th percentile fastest card exist worry ti super upper limit video card limited
"I'm an AMD fan, writing this from a 5900X. The 7800X3D and 9800X3D are the top tier gaming CPUs. 

But the 7600 is the entry level AM5 CPU, and the worst CPU in its price class. 

It's hardly a top tier when nearly ever other Ryzen 7000/9000 CPU beats it. 

On AM5, the 9600 is about to beat it for a similar price: 
https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/desktops/ryzen/9000-series/amd-ryzen-5-9600.html

The benefit of the 7600 is it's upgrade potential, it can be upgraded to 1-2 newer generations of CPU. On the other hand, we could say the same about Arrow Lake Intel Ultra 200. 

In reality it's a layaway plan, you pay about $400 now, and then you can pay another $400-$500 later to upgrade to an 8-12 core CPU like a 9800X3D or future Zen 6. 

If we use parametric filters for the cheapest 32GB RAM with decent latency (10ns first word) and cheapest ATX motherboard. 

AM5's requirement for DDR5 makes it expensive, along with having very expensive motherboards. 

The 7600's performance is at best competitive with the 5700X3D. 

On the Intel side, a 12 core 12700KF can compete with a 7700X while costing less than a 7600. It ends up much cheaper overall, and even if you use DDR5, it will still come out cheaper.

While you only get 6 cores, you can upgrade again to an 8-12 core CPU in the next couple years, so about $400 now and maybe about $400 later.

"Pointless. Spend money on performance. Liquid coolers are only needed for very power hungry cpu's and if you don't have a cpu that literally cannot be cooled by an air cooler, you're spending money on the clout of being able to say ""my computer is water-cooled"", and believe me, nobody gives a shit.

Your running a system with a 12 year old cpu that is a quad core without multi-threading, on a DDR3 platform. This is what you should be looking to upgrade - hopefully the power supply isn't that old either.

This is what you should be saving up for.

Then, once you have a system that can actually perform ok at 1080p, I'd say you can go ahead and buy silly things like a water cooler without being totally crazy (still pointless but if it makes you happy then it makes you happy).

And just so this makes some sense;

CPU/platform upgrade comes first because as you pointed out, the cpu you have is so slow it's holding back even an RX 570 - to get full performance from it, you need a better cpu. Because your system is so old, you also need a motherboard, ram and a cooler for the cpu upgrade. 

Next comes upgrading the gpu because you have a cpu that can handle it, so a good budget option that performs well for the money such as the 6650XT is a good idea, but I'd imagine the power supply in your system is as old and bad as that cpu, so upgrading that to a well made budget optoin is important so you don't have an IED sitting on your desk. Along with that, upgrading the storage from what I assume you have is a HDD to a quick NVME SSD makes the entire system run wayyy faster and smoother, and makes the pc feel like it belongs in 2025.",pointless spend money performance liquid cooler needed power hungry cpu cpu literally cooled air cooler spending money clout able say computer watercooled believe nobody give shit running system year old cpu quad core without multithreading ddr platform looking upgrade hopefully power supply old either saving pcpartpicker part listhttpspcpartpickercomlistytcxs typeitemprice cpuamd ryzen x ghz core processorhttpspcpartpickercomproductgbdamdryzenxghzcoreprocessorbox amazon cpu coolerthermalright assassin x refined se cfm cpu coolerhttpspcpartpickercomproductqhyjthermalrightassassinxrefinedsecfmcpucooleraxsed amazon motherboardmsi bm provdh wifi micro atx motherboardhttpspcpartpickercomproductpdsntwmsibmprovdhwifimicroatxammotherboardbmprovdhwifi msi memorysilicon power gaming gb x gb ddr cl memoryhttpspcpartpickercomproductpfkhxsiliconpowerspgxlzubdajgbxgbddrclmemoryspgxlzubdaj amazon price include shipping tax rebate discount total generated pcpartpickerhttpspcpartpickercom est get stuff gpu psu storage upgrade next something like pcpartpicker part listhttpspcpartpickercomlistptqd typeitemprice storageteamgroup mpq tb pcie x nvme solid state drivehttpspcpartpickercomproducthjzxrteamgroupmpqtbmpciexnvmesolidstatedrivetmffdtc newegg video cardxfx speedster swft core radeon rx xt gb video cardhttpspcpartpickercomproductndvdnqxfxradeonrxxtgbspeedsterswftcorevideocardrxxdfdy newegg power supplysilverstone essential w gold certified semimodular atx power supplyhttpspcpartpickercomproductcrndnqsilverstoneessentialwgoldcertifiedsemimodularatxpowersupplysstethg amazon price include shipping tax rebate discount total generated pcpartpickerhttpspcpartpickercom est system actually perform ok p would say go ahead buy silly thing like water cooler without totally crazy still pointless make happy make happy make sense cpuplatform upgrade come first pointed cpu slow holding back even rx get full performance need better cpu system old also need motherboard ram cooler cpu upgrade next come upgrading gpu cpu handle good budget option performs well money xt good idea would imagine power supply system old bad cpu upgrading well made budget optoin important ied sitting desk along upgrading storage assume hdd quick nvme ssd make entire system run wayyy faster smoother make pc feel like belongs
"Yes, all of them support Windows 11. A 5600 or i5-12400F is a much better CPU for a little more money. 

With Intel you also get a much better motherboard and the ability to upgrade further without having to replace the motherboard and RAM a second time. 

Even an i3-12100F is a solid upgrade from it: 
https://youtu.be/JPPeSNV9Hog

Though the i3 brand has a lot of stigma from old models which were low performance, a new i3 can outperform most i7 CPUs. The main weakness of the 5500 comes from the weak single thread performance which tanks gaming performance:

"Other than the cheapest B650 boards (a few of which have crummy VRMs), they will all work equally well for gaming with your 9800x3D and 4090.  So, just evaluate the B850 and X870 boards for the features you want/need and price level you're OK with.

Choose x870 for the following reasons:

* Major overclocking (larger VRMs)
* More M.2 drives that are at least 4x4
* USB4 in all x870 boards
* More fast USB ports
* Debug codes in more models (largely for memory/CPU overclockers)
* 5G and above networking more common
* All have Wi-Fi 7

"I’d be a little concerned with the 750W gold power supply. I know that part picker is estimating a 600-650 watt load, but I’m not so sure. Newegg was thinking a bit more power. With all the money being dumped into the 4080 and 7800x3d might not be a bad idea to get a bit more power or aim for a platinum or titanium rated supply. It’s always a bit sketchy getting a PSU that’s already near the max capacity for a system. Just a suggestion.

I’d also consider a 360mm just to ensure that you’re getting all the heat away from your x3d to maximize CPU performance. You should be able to mount the 360mm on the front panel and get some exhaust on the top and rear to pull air through.

Another more premium thing that I invested in on my last build was braided ATX cables for your modular power supply. Yeah they cost a bit more money, but they route a bit better and stay really clean for cable routing (especially with the combs to keep them organized). Looks REALLY nice afterwards, as well.

Lastly, any thermal paste? Thermal Grizzly Duronaut or Arctic MX-6 are definitely better thermal interface solutions than whatever comes on the AIO.

You should look into installing the storage yourself, if you do have a spare M.2 slot it's as simple as inserting it at an angle, pressing it towards the board and screwing in. If you don't have a spare M.2 slot then just install the SATA SSD into the space on your case designed for 2.5"" drives (sometimes a bay, sometimes a mounting point - case dependant), connect a SATA data cable between the drive and your motherboard (included in mobo box or cheap online) and then a SATA power cable from your PSU also to the drive. 

If you buy the storage from a little computer shop they might be willing to fit it free since it will take a few minutes at most, but I certainly wouldn't pay and significant amount of money for someone to fit it.

"Oh yea I believe so, I recognize the brand and the placement of those slots",oh yea believe recognize brand placement slot
"Ok so after looking into it, according to your [manual](https://download.asrock.com/Manual/B550M-C.pdf) and [Asrock's website](https://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/B550M-C/index.us.asp), it looks like you have two m.2 slots that each support NVMe SSDs which is great news!   
  
If you go to page 7 of your manual (1.3 Motherboard Layout), you can see their locations on your motherboard. The M2\_1 slot (best slot) fully supports PCIe 4.0x4 speeds and the M2\_2 slot supports PCIe 3.0x2. If they aren't populated, I would highly recommend purchasing an NVMe SSD. They are the easiest to install and the fastest drives on the market right now. Do note, the M2\_2 slot (in the bottom right corner) would max out at roughly 2000 MB/s speeds so if you get a faster drive and place it there, don't worry about the speeds being lower than what they should be (2000 MB/s is more than enough for games anyways). On the other hand, the M2\_1 slot would fully support the speeds of whatever NVMe Gen 4.0 drive you put into it.   
  
There are definitely videos on the internet that would show you how to install an NVMe drive as well. The process is way easier than installing a 2.5 inch SATA SSD.   
  
On a different note, I would also recommend making the M2\_1 drive your boot drive if it isn't already. You should see much faster boot times if you do (especially if you have an HDD as a boot drive)! There are a lot of tutorials on the internet to do that as well, the easiest method would be is to make a USB installer with the Windows media creation tool. Although if you're doing that for the first time, I'd recommend disconnecting every other drive than the one that you'd want to make a boot drive as it would be pretty easy to format a drive and wipe it for a beginner (data recovery would be a pain if you do). Or you could even get help with that tbh.",ok looking according manualhttpsdownloadasrockcommanualbmcpdf asrocks websitehttpswwwasrockcommbamdbmcindexusasp look like two slot support nvme ssds great news go page manual motherboard layout see location motherboard slot best slot fully support pcie x speed slot support pcie x populated would highly recommend purchasing nvme ssd easiest install fastest drive market right note slot bottom right corner would max roughly mb speed get faster drive place worry speed lower mb enough game anyways hand slot would fully support speed whatever nvme gen drive put definitely video internet would show install nvme drive well process way easier installing inch sata ssd different note would also recommend making drive boot drive already see much faster boot time especially hdd boot drive lot tutorial internet well easiest method would make usb installer window medium creation tool although first time would recommend disconnecting every drive one would want make boot drive would pretty easy format drive wipe beginner data recovery would pain could even get help tbh

RAID 0 has lost a lot of its benefit since SSDs were introduced - it was really HDDs that had a more substantial benefit from it because they have longer seek time. Modern NVMEs have a faster read time than 99.99% of people have the ability to take advantage of and as such do not benefit from RAID 0. In addition, with RAID 0 if they have a failure of a single drive they lose ALL their data.

Because you pay for 2 drives and only get one drive's worth of capacity. And read speeds are fast enough that it's not worth doing it.,pay drive get one drive worth capacity read speed fast enough worth
"Because you don't actually see that in the real world for various reasons, and can dink the write speed and random performance a bit.

I currently run a pair of 1TB 990 Pros in RAID 1 (AM5 platform, 9900x with an x870e) for my OS, and I only see fractionally above sequential CrystalDiskMark benchmarks on the Internet for it (sequential read benchmarks put one drive at 7,152 MB/s, I see 7,100 MB/s to 7,300 MB/s). If I compare to a single 4TB 990 Pro in the same system, I see a sequential read of 6,900 MB/s. So there is a definite improvement, but not double. [Here's a side-by-side of a benchmark on the RAID array (left) and the single 4TB drive (right)](https://imgur.com/a/2yyCLhJ). These were just random runs, not cherry picked or rerun multiple times.

I saw more of a read performance increase on my old build (5900x, x570) that used 512GB Gen 3 SSDs, but one of these 990 Pros out performs that notably. I also run a pair of 2TB MX500 drives in RAID 1, and those basically see a doubling (560 MB/s for a single drive to 1060 MB/s for a pair).

  
So why are the results like that? On consumer platforms it's because the RAID is software RAID with the CPU handling the calculations, and when you are at Gen 4 speeds, that's a lot of overhead. An enterprise RAID controller ([like this](https://www.scan.co.uk/products/highpoint-ssd7105-4x-m2-nvme-raid-controller-2242-2260-2280-22110-pcie-30-x16-single-raid-0-1-10-win)) *may* give better performance, but you have to deal with the lanes you need for it. Remember that SSDs are already essentially a RAID array in and of themselves - the multiple flash chips are used in parallel to improve read/write speeds typically.

When running on a consumer platform, you also have where the lanes are coming from to contend with - for a typical AMD platform, you normally have 4 lanes from the CPU dedicated to an SSD. Any other CPU lanes that could be used for an SSD then typically drop the graphics card slot to 8x. This means that for ""peak"" graphics performance, you are using an SSD interface that comes from the chipset, which is on it's own 4x link to the CPU. That 4x link is shared for USB, networking, other drives, etc. etc. etc. etc.

There is also the fun of dealing with the oddities of the RAID controller - since building this new system, I've had the RAID array dump one of the drives into a failed state and then refuse to boot until I've done a Windows startup repair, which needs an install USB with the RAID Drivers (I've gone and slipstreamed them in now so I don't have to faff with manual driver loading from the recovery command prompt). This is a new ""feature"" that I didn't have on the AM4 build, and really kills the redundancy benefits from having an OS mirror...

2) it's more expensive as you need more drives.
3) average users aren't aware of RAID even being a thing, let alone how to set it up.

Technically speaking all RAID is software, it's just a matter of what's interpreting it. 

As for point 4, while it does not apply to RAID 1 specifically, I wasn't talking about RAID 1, but rather RAID 0, as the topic here is increasing the speeds via RAID. RAID 1 doesn't actually increase the speed, and is in fact a bit slower than the fastest drive in the RAID. If you just need a speed increase, with no concern over data reliability or parity and mirroring, you should use RAID 0, to which point 4 applies. The main benefit of RAID 1 is a reduction of latency as the request can be serviced by any drive, which is especially noticeable with the spinning disks due to the way they work.

I hope your research involved looking at the [Manufacturer's CPU support list](https://www.gigabyte.com/Motherboard/GA-AB350-Gaming-3-rev-1x/support#support-cpu), because this is answered definitively there.

>If I upgrade my processor and nothing else, will that be good enough to play on 60 fps?

What's your GPU and CPU usage during gaming at the moment? If the GPU is already pegged at 100%, upgrading the CPU only won't help.

And [this one with a 1060 3GB not being CPU limited by a 4790K](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=feBsA5dWsn8).

My money is on you being GPU limited rather than CPU limited, and an upgrade to a 5800x won't make the difference you think it will.

"Yes, at 4K resolution, the GPU is generally more important than the CPU, especially for gaming. However, since you're focusing on photo and video editing, your CPU choice still matters.

Video editing software like Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve rely heavily on CPU performance for tasks like rendering, encoding, and timeline scrubbing. The Ryzen 7700 is a solid choice, but if your workload includes heavy video editing, color grading, or effects, a higher-end CPU with more cores (like a 12-core option) could offer better long-term performance. It all depends on the budget.",yes k resolution gpu generally important cpu especially gaming however since focusing photo video editing cpu choice still matter video editing software like premiere pro davinci resolve rely heavily cpu performance task like rendering encoding timeline scrubbing ryzen solid choice workload includes heavy video editing color grading effect higherend cpu core like core option could offer better longterm performance depends budget
"7700 is more like $300

but yes, 4k is more gpu bound, it can still benefit from a better cpu at times",like yes k gpu bound still benefit better cpu time
"CPU doesn’t care about the resolution or (most) quality settings. It’ll run the game at the same frame time regardless of what those are set to. Note frame *time*, not frame rate. That is how long it takes to execute a single game update.

The GPU on the other hand cares greatly about the resolution and quality settings. And 4k is especially hard to render. And if the GPU takes longer to render a frame than the CPU, then the CPU will be waiting on the GPU and your frame rate thus whatever the GPU can do.

Most current games will be GPU limited at 4k, so getting a *7600* vs a 9800X3D will make little difference in the frame rate you see. But there are legitimately a few games out today that will still be CPU limited at 4k, even with a 9800X3D, assuming you have a 4080 or 4090. And there will likely be more and more games in the future that will as well.

That’s not to say that you shouldn’t go with a 7700 now, as most games won’t see a benefit, and the 7700 is already an excellent gaming CPU. It’s just to say that the 9800X3D isn’t *entirely* pointless for 4k.

I’d also say that when it comes to AM5 gaming, your real choices are:

7600, 7600X, 9600, 9600X, 7800X3D, or 9800X3D.

Between the 7600 and 7700X the gaming performance difference is a tiny single digit percentage difference. And if you enable PBO, a 7600 and 7700X will perform functionally exactly the same. Between the 7600 and 7600X is more about which is cheaper, and if you want to use the stock cooler or not as the X suffix version does not include it.

The 9600X is faster in gaming than a 7700X, even with PBO enabled on the 7700X but not the 9600X, but is less expensive than it. So it’s kind of the only logical step up. The 9700X is ever so slightly faster still, but not worth the $100 price increase.

The 7800X3D is a massive 25%\~30% performance increase beyond the 9600X, and the 9800X3D is another 20%\~30% beyond that.

The #700X CPUs add two more cores, which are good for systems where you want additional multithreaded performance for non-gaming applications.

4k is like zero context info. Even on a 5090 you cant run max settings on several games. Which means you need to use upscaling to jump to decent/good frame rates. Which means lower internal render resolution. Which means cpu becomes more important. Especially if we are talking about new dlss transformer model which has turned even performance mode into actually very usable.,k like zero context info even cant run max setting several game mean need use upscaling jump decentgood frame rate mean lower internal render resolution mean cpu becomes important especially talking new dlss transformer model turned even performance mode actually usable
"No, a 5700x3D and up will be pretty optimal for 4k120 in most cases with a not-completely-insane priced GPU.
... So a 7600x or better out of modern non x3D CPUs is going to be pretty good. Unless you're playing with a 4080 or better, you're not going to benefit that much from a better CPU if you run optimised settings and FPS targets. Even a 3090 isn't going to Max out a 5800x3D in most cases, and when it does, you're also pretty much on the line GPU wise because you're running RT, or you're destroying your image anyway with too much upscaling.

Balance within your budget, optimise settings, leave room for growth but don't go crazy buying performance you're not going to use because you might upgrade in a few years (where the midrange will outpace whatever the current high end option is anyway).

"""It's complicated"" is the short answer.

The long answer is that you can run all four sticks, especially if you find that 16GB is not enough, but may find that you can't run it at 3600 MT/s. If you run all four, you run the same config in each channel, i.e. an 8GB and a 16GB per channel. What's the rest of your system specs?

In more detail, if these are all single-rank modules and they have the same XMP profiles, then there is a good chance this will work on any platform where the 8GBs were running at 3600 MT/s and you might see a little performance improvement from interleaving. If you have a mix of single-rank and dual-rank (so three ranks per channel), whether it works or not is less certain. Four ranks per channel is far harder to run at XMP speed.

If it won't hit XMP, then it's very much a question of does the extra capacity offset the loss in performance for you.",complicated short answer long answer run four stick especially find gb enough may find run mt run four run config channel ie gb gb per channel whats rest system spec detail singlerank module xmp profile good chance work platform gb running mt might see little performance improvement interleaving mix singlerank dualrank three rank per channel whether work less certain four rank per channel far harder run xmp speed hit xmp much question extra capacity offset loss performance

"My old 8700K ran four sticks of DDR4-3600 fine at XMP speeds, on a high-end Z390 motherboard. That was the exception though, not the rule; if the CPU's memory controller isn't up to snuff, if the motherboard's memory traces are *minutely* imperfect, the RAM won't work at high speeds.

Run it at DDR4-3200 if it doesn't work at 3600, the difference is academic (especially since you can probably tighten up the timings to be quicker than stock, which will make up all the difference.)",old k ran four stick ddr fine xmp speed highend z motherboard exception though rule cpu memory controller snuff motherboards memory trace minutely imperfect ram work high speed run ddr work difference academic especially since probably tighten timing quicker stock make difference
I mentioned the mobo model. Lower end Z370. That's what I did i.e. reduced the speed to 3400mhz and tested some games. Will do stability test later,mentioned mobo model lower end z thats ie reduced speed mhz tested game stability test later

BIOS was already updated. Old sticks max out at 3400(3466) 18-20-20-40(42).Higher clock or lower timings won't boot at all. Surprisingly high OC for 2666 cl19 sticks without heatsinks.

The 8-pin at the bottom of the board, you can use one of the extra pci cables I used a 6+2 cable.

"I've included shorter RAM as it improves compatibility with CPU coolers. 

I would strongly recommend an AIO liquid freezer with a 5090. The 5090, especially Founders Edition is a card at an unparalleled power level. 

I was an early adopter with a 3090 Founders Edition and even that worked very poorly with air coolers. The hot air would blow straight into the cooler: 
https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipMj_MWh942BmTZvCji1qIvLMafOI388icMjB2edjfCGiV52YlTfrhKGKGI5485sXg?key=ZkJySV8xUEFTR2pVY2MycTBmYVptVHRtRTdTMERR

With a 5090, I would be afraid of impaired exhaust airflow with a massive air cooler over it. This would be the area of the blue line in the above image. 

The Crucial P3 Plus is QLC SSD. Basically this means it's a 2TB SSD, but they force 4TB of data onto it by writing half as big and using a smaller ""font"". These SSDs start fast, and then get slower and slower as they have to keep decreasing the size they write at. Also this method results in them having under half the lifespan. 

The MSI SSD is better cheaper. The SN850X is a great choice for a high end build. The Team Z540 is the best, and isn't unreasonable for a build where everything else is the best:

"1. On paper, using one cable with two connectors on the end is fine, even with high end GPUs. However sometime there might be some stability issues for a number of reasons, so it is recommended to use two separate cables if you can. I personally had 3 high end GPUs in the last few years powered with two different PSUs with one cable-two connectors and all was fine, but it's not always guaranteed, just like 99% of Zen4 CPUs can handle RAM 6000Mhz but few rare ones can't stay stable.
2. It is safe to just leave the unused connectors hanging. As long as you're not poking with metal into them it's fine.
3. Buying two cables with single connector each does not bring anything better than two cables with two connectors each. No better stability, efficiency or safety. If you will buy them however, you must be absolutely sure the cables are compatible with your PSU. PSU cables are generally not transferable between different PSUs models because each PSU might use different connectors, or pin layout.
4. There should be no difference among the connectors on the PSU.

4070s 2% slower than 7900GRE
	

[Now, here's the update from last month with a bunch of 2024 released titles.](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/gpu-test-system-update-for-2025/2.html )

4070s 15% faster than 7800XT

4070s 4% faster than 7900GRE


About 7% swing in one year. Let's go through some of the bigger 2024 titles:

[Black Myth Wukong](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/black-myth-wukong-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 26% faster than 7800XT, nearly as fast as 7900XT

[Silent HIll 2](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/silent-hill-2-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 44% faster than 7800XT, nearly as fast as 7900XTX\(!\)

 [Dragon Age Veilguard](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html) - 4070s 21% faster than 7800XT.

[Star Wars Outlaws](https://www.techpowerup.com/review/star-wars-outlaws-fps-performance-benchmark/5.html ) - 4070s 26% faster than 7800XT.

There's so many games releasing now that use UE5/RT that you can't turn off, it's almost like AMD has shifted down a tier compared to Nvidia. Already 7% average in one year, where's it going to be a few years from now? Especially if more games are like SH2?

Even in pure raster, the lack of RT will a far bigger problem long term than the lack of vRAM, with the latter you can just turn down settings. Add in the fact that RDNA3 is going to be a dead end in terms of features (won't support FSR 4 for example), they're just not cheap enough to recommend now.

Look at this way - the 4070s is now 15% ahead of the 7800XT,  but using the links in OP it's about 20% more expensive, so even in pure price:performance it's barely behind anymore.",would recommend waiting new generation card point go sign current amd card going age horribly undercutting enough really justify lack feature techpowerups average performance early note following phttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewsapphireradeonrxgrepulsehtml faster xt slower gre update last month bunch released titleshttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewgputestsystemupdateforhtml faster xt faster gre swing one year let go bigger title black myth wukonghttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewblackmythwukongfpsperformancebenchmarkhtml faster xt nearly fast xt silent hill httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewsilenthillfpsperformancebenchmarkhtml faster xt nearly fast xtx dragon age veilguardhttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewdragonagetheveilguardfpsperformancebenchmarkhtml faster xt star war outlawshttpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewstarwarsoutlawsfpsperformancebenchmarkhtml faster xt there many game releasing use uert turn almost like amd shifted tier compared nvidia already average one year going year especially game like sh even pure raster lack rt far bigger problem long term lack vram latter turn setting add fact rdna going dead end term feature support fsr example cheap enough recommend look way ahead xt using link op expensive even pure priceperformance barely behind anymore

Last year I tested 6x HDD all of them were older and were being thrown into a PC built out of spare parts or as data storage. Turns out 2x were dying and I didn't know that till I tested them. The full format forces it to write to every sector and than the SMART test will test everything it can afterwards, this should pick up faults if there are any on the HDD.

My oldest drive is a 640gb WD Black that is from 08 or 09.

"I’ve never owned a 4070 Ti Super, but I have had both the 4090 and 7900 XTX. I have since sold my 4090 last month and kept the 7900 XTX.

I mostly play games in 4K native resolution without RT, except for some games, and games that force RT with no option to turn it off. In my observation, the gaming experience doesn’t change much whether RT is on or off. Some games like Cyberpunk, Alan Wake 2, and Horizon do shine when RT is enabled, though this doesn’t mean these games are bad without RT—it’s just my personal taste.

I also find DLSS to be helpful, and not as bad as some people say, especially since it helps reduce the load on my GPU. I have a 10L SFFPC (FormD T1), so excessive heat is my enemy.

**Overall**, I recommend the 4070 Ti Super over the 7900 XTX for the reasons mentioned above. More upcoming AAA games will likely force RT, so DLSS will be very useful. While the upcoming 9070 is expected to significantly improve RT, given your situation, it’s better to choose between these two options or consider a used 4080 Super. That said, you can't go wrong with either option—I love my 7900 XTX, and it has served my needs well.",ive never owned ti super xtx since sold last month kept xtx mostly play game k native resolution without rt except game game force rt option turn observation gaming experience doesnt change much whether rt game like cyberpunk alan wake horizon shine rt enabled though doesnt mean game bad without rtits personal taste also find dlss helpful bad people say especially since help reduce load gpu l sffpc formd excessive heat enemy overall recommend ti super xtx reason mentioned upcoming aaa game likely force rt dlss useful upcoming expected significantly improve rt given situation better choose two option consider used super said go wrong either optioni love xtx served need well

"Well, in the multiplayer titles she'll have a very similar experience with both cards honestly. The major differences are really going to be in those specific single player games like Cyberpunk.

**The 4070TI Super** is a competent RT card that can dabble in path tracing with the right combination of DLSS and frame gen. It also has access to DLSS 4's new transformer model which is proving to make even Performance level upscaling very viable. Some are even saying it practically matches the Quality mode from the old CNN model. Those features make the Nvidia card more enticing for Cyberpunk imo, BUT that's only one game... If you think Cyberpunk will be a gateway for her to dive into other graphics intensive/heavy RT titles, then that could make a stronger case for this card.

**The 7900XTX** on the other hand is really a powerhouse of a card. In terms of rasterized 1440p Ultra gaming, she'd probably see 10-20fps more from the AMD card depending on the game. And that gap would likely grow if you enabled upscaling on both cards. Generally speaking I'd say this is the better 1440p card, but you're not going to be doing very heavy ray tracing with it and you will notice the quality drop when using upscaling. Unfortunately it's still not confirmed that the 7000 series cards will get access to FSR 4 (which seems to be really closing the gap between FSR and DLSS), and if they do eventually get it, it could very likely be a software based version similar to XeSS on non-Intel cards.

**Overall:** I don't think you'll go wrong with either card, and in most cases I doubt your girlfriend will notice the difference. If you think she's really going to fall in love with Cyberpunk and you want her to have the best experience in that specific title, then the 4070TI Super is probably the better buy. But if she's going to play her multiplayer games 90% of the time, then I'd lean toward the 7900XTX.",well multiplayer title similar experience card honestly major difference really going specific single player game like cyberpunk ti super competent rt card dabble path tracing right combination dlss frame gen also access dlss new transformer model proving make even performance level upscaling viable even saying practically match quality mode old cnn model feature make nvidia card enticing cyberpunk imo one game think cyberpunk gateway dive graphic intensiveheavy rt title could make stronger case card xtx hand really powerhouse card term rasterized p ultra gaming would probably see fps amd card depending game gap would likely grow enabled upscaling card generally speaking would say better p card going heavy ray tracing notice quality drop using upscaling unfortunately still confirmed series card get access fsr seems really closing gap fsr dlss eventually get could likely software based version similar xess nonintel card overall think go wrong either card case doubt girlfriend notice difference think really going fall love cyberpunk want best experience specific title ti super probably better buy going play multiplayer game time would lean toward xtx

"Had the 7900 XTX for a month plus and sent it back, just got a used 4070 Ti Super, yes it won't beat the 7900 XTX in raster but DLSS4 is like the Deepseek AI, totally disruptive and amazing, the 4070 Ti Super running CP2077 on a 3440x1440 in DLSS balanced with FG full path tracing is beyond crazy of a visual improvement at close to 100 fps, and this is compared to my 4090 prior to the latest update that I had temporarily in this build for about 2 weeks when I returned the 7900 XTX.

Wanted to try an all AMD build with the 9800X3D but so glad to be back to team green on the GPU side.

The 7900 XTX isn't totally bad at ray tracing - its a bit behind the 4070 Ti Super, but you can't rely on as good upscaling which is really needed for heavy ray tracing or full path tracing.

"Not the OP of the comment but... I also had a 7900 xtx, which replaced a 3080 I had in the past. I sold it and bought a 4070 TI super. 

I did like my 7900 for about a year as I didn't have many issues. Until one day I couldn't stop having driver updates. No matter what version EXCEPT over a year+ old driver would cause constant driver crashes in MOST games I personally play. WoW, FF14, Path of Exile 2, random ARPGs etc. 

Did I get more raw FPS in some cases compared to the 4070 TI, yes. However. I will say I am a SUCKER for ray tracing. Minecraft RTX water is my wet dream lol It's so pretty! I have not once ran into an issue where having more VRAM would have been a fix, not once. I don't think i've ever really got above10 or 12GB of usage. I game at 5120x1440p with a240hz monitor. I cannot for the life of me in any gave i've tried for DLSS notice the difference at this resolution and monitor size (49"").

"No problem man! I just thought you asked a good question that deserved a good answer haha. I knew most people would just say one card or the other which ultimately isn't very helpful.

In regard to your question about whether or not RT will make her experience better, I think it's a bit of a tough question. The fact is that most games are still great even without ray tracing. Sometimes it doesn't even necessarily improve the game, and in a few cases it can even make it slightly worse by introducing artifacting. 

But that being said, when RT works well it can really make a difference in the ""wow factor."" Cyberpunk is definitely a good example of RT (and especially path tracing) really improving the whole vibe of the game. I know if I had a card that could use path tracing (even with upscaling like the 4070TI Super), I'd definitely use it in Cyberpunk because it looks gorgeous in that game!

I also think you're right that DLSS is definitely worth more than people give it credit for at times. I think ultimately people are upset that developers seem to be using it as crutch instead of optimizing their games, but at the end of the day the tech itself is really kind of amazing (especially the new transformer model). And being able to kick on upscaling without a major downgrade in visuals will definitely allow those cards to last longer than current gen AMD cards ( just IMO! Please no one grab your pitch forks lol).

This is all coming from someone using a 6950XT by the way. So, I'm by no means an Nvidia fan boy. I've just seen first hand the difference between DLSS and FSR enough to know that I will never use FSR performance mode. But on the other hand, the new DLSS performance looks pretty damn good... So, if you've got an AMD and Nvidia card with similar performance, but one can use aggressive upscaling and the other can't... well to me it's obvious that the one that can use it will last longer.

"my 2 cents as i made this decision between 7900xtx and 4070 ti super a month ago alongside a 4k monitor. ended up upgrading from rx 6800 to rtx 4070 ti super, main reason was for games like CP2077 and ray tracing on 4K. from the benchmarks 7900xtx really struggled with RT so I ended up going green. prior to that always been a Red Gpu user, never played 4K and never played RT on, and yeah it made me go woow, and I’m looking for RT to turn on whatever I play now. it makes games look so much alive to have correct glass, water effects and shadows and reflections and everything. on 4K Ultra settings, DLSS quality, RT Ultra (no PathTracing) even without the Frame Generation it mostly got me 50-60 FPS on Cyberpunk. with Framegen 60fps stable. Finished TLOU Part 1 4K Ultra Native 50-60 Fps stable.

">Also people always say DLSS is overrated 

I'd bet most of them never even tried DLSS.   
Owned a 7900 XTX and a 4080/Super too, tho I only have experience at 1440p, but at that resolution, most of the time the difference is huge - and I'm not even talking about DLSS 4 yet.   
FSR was something that I'd only enable if it was a must, while DLSS at the Quality preset is usually a no-brainer for me. (DLDSR + DLSS combined is also pretty great stuff.)  
Considering that FSR 4.0 may really be RX 9000 exclusive, yea, I'd rather take the 4070 Ti Super, even if it's like \~18% slower on average in rasterization.   
Also, if you have an HDR capable monitor, RTX HDR is a killer feature.",also people always say dlss overrated would bet never even tried dlss owned xtx super tho experience p resolution time difference huge even talking dlss yet fsr something would enable must dlss quality preset usually nobrainer dldsr dlss combined also pretty great stuff considering fsr may really rx exclusive yea would rather take ti super even like slower average rasterization also hdr capable monitor rtx hdr killer feature
"One thing is that DLSS and other features like RT will take up VRAM overtime. The new DLSS4 will help because it is a more capable model than previous DLSS and FSR, but the 4070 does not have hardware specific stuff the 50 series has so it isn't getting all of the features (frame-gen, etc.).

AMD has its quirks, once you learn them you can avoid 90% of the driver/stability issues and the XTX or at least my Phantom OC has a nice headroom for overclocking and undervolting(got mine stable at 1120mV and probably can go even lower), and it got really usefull when OC gave me almost 20fps boost on my 4K tv that got me close to the 120Hz refresh rate and got rid of frame dips.

">Question is if raytracing is noticeable and would make her be like WOOOW when playing.

In my experience, ray tracing looks great, but in most cases, you have to look closely to see the difference. It varies from game to game—some titles look stunning with ray tracing, while in others, the impact is barely noticeable.

Also the performance hit while using raytracing is huge, like in some games i'll get 144 fps but as soon as I turn on raytracing, it'll tank down to 70-80.

>To an untrained eye, how cool is raytracing?

If we're being brutally honest though, 95% of the time, they won’t notice much. They might say it looks slightly better or not see a difference at all.

Now with DLSS 4, it’s going to be even better, especially considering when you can’t even use FSR4 with 7900xtx but you can use DLSS 4 and new FG update with 40 series. It’s a no brainer. So 7900xtx will be stuck with last gen AMD tech when 40 series is improving from being already better.

"I had the exact opposite experience. Nowadays im on Linux so I have to go AMD anyway, since Nvidia drivers are a hassle and generally also perform worse than its Windows counterparts. But even back on Windows I had more issues on Nvidia, in terms of driver updates breaking things.

"hmm, based off of your description I'd be more inclined to think there is an issue with the case.

Try this:

Uninstall the audio driver & restart

Log back in, then go straight to Windows Update and run it, let it find what it thinks the correct audio driver is, then let it install

Restart when done

Test

Was there any change?

The overall audio (i.e. the rear audio ports/jacks) is working fine and you just want to plug in your headphones and have them work, right?  And plug them into the front panel on the case right?

You can work around the problem like get a [USB audio interface](https://www.amazon.com/Plugable-Headphone-Microphone-Aluminum-Compatible/dp/B00NMXY2MO) and plug it into your front USB port on your case and connect your 3.5mm headphone jack into that.  

Alternately you can get a [Bluetooth headset](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WH-CH520-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone/dp/B0BS1PRC4L) and just use that, nothing to plug in then, it just connects via Bluetooth.

Note that is assuming your mobo has Bluetooth. You can get a [$5 USB bluetooth interface for your PC](https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-Controller-UB500/dp/B09DMP6T22) if it doesn't come with one on the motherboard.

Note that I use that Sony headset I linked for work and it does great.  No mic boom but I still come across clear and sound is perfectly fine.

"Wouldn't my windows be up to date already? I think it's more my mobo drivers that deal with the audio isn't it? I just turned the PC on for the first time yesterday, I can't imagine uninstalling the drivers and re-installing the same ones would have a different result. 

And yes, I do just want to plug in my headphones in the front jack and have it work, I'd rather reserve the rear jack for external speakers.

Also, it's not a gaming headset or anything with software. Just a decent pair of Sennheiser cans with no mic either. The weird audio mixer option in Windows that shows headset but isn't my headset also leads me to believe it's not really a case or driver issue though. But I'm really not versed in Windows 11 enough to really understand why that's there though.",wouldnt window date already think mobo driver deal audio turned pc first time yesterday imagine uninstalling driver reinstalling one would different result yes want plug headphone front jack work would rather reserve rear jack external speaker also gaming headset anything software decent pair sennheiser can mic either weird audio mixer option window show headset headset also lead believe really case driver issue though really versed window enough really understand though

"> My rough budget would be £1000-1300 for the new build and am looking to use the Ryzen 7 7800x3d for my CPU.

Pretty expensive build for that CPU. If you're playing competitive settings or low resolution, high framerate games otherwise, then sure, but a 4060 is a really suboptimal pairing for the 7800X3D. If that were my PC I'd get a 7600/X and a cheaper cooler, and then dump the rest of the budget into the fattest GPU you can get (and a bit better power supply too.)

"Four sticks of DDR5 is unlikely to run as fast as two sticks without making adjustments (raising voltage, slowing speed or loosening timings or some combination of those).

These days it's only recommended to go to four sticks when that's the only way to get the capacity you need and then you want to buy a four stick set that comes with an XMP/EXPO profile specifically for the four sticks and ideally one on the QVL for your motherboard.

If you can return the sticks you just bought and buy a 2x32 set, that would be a better way to get to 64GB (though a little more expensive).

FYI, 6000 CL30 is the good Hynix RAM chips so that's probably what you want for Ryzen.

If you don't mind experimenting, you could try running the four sticks at 5600 or 5200 to see if they got stable. And, definitely use a good memory test for at least a couple hours (like Karhu, OCCT, Y-cruncher, Prime 95, TM5) to see if they appear stable.

Have you tried ONLY using the new sticks vs trying only the old sticks? And obviously you tried the old and new sticks together.

All ram is considered overclocked especially at 6000 or higher.

Other than that I'd just assume there's something wrong with them and return it.

It’s not as simple as sending a .CAP from the manufacturers site to the chip when compared to re-flashing a dump because some amount of perpetual state is carried between images.

"How do you define ""high refresh rate"" 2k? Is that 1440p at 180hz or >800hz?

A 5090 gets you to the later, even without frame gen, which if you don't have the monitor to go with is possibly overkill. A 4080, or possibly even only a RTX 5070 / RX 9070, gets you to the >480hz range fairly easily. I'd definitely not go for a 5090 unless you just absolutely must have the best and don't care about the price.

Case wise, the O11 is a very good, very attractive line of cases. I'm personally partial to the O11 Vision more than the EVO, but that's just personal preference.

The other user's comment about PCIe 5.0 x2 vs PCIe 5.0 x4 or PCIe 4.0 x4 SSDs is a little silly. The 990 EVO and EVO Plus drives support both 5.0 x2 and 4.0 x4. It's a neat hat trick that isn't really relevant to consumers as those two are the same speed. I.E.: It's a PCIe 4.0 SSD that they're trying to pretend is a 5.0 SSD. It matters for servers where they have a lot more PCIe 5.0 lanes and control over how they split them up, so having 5.0 x2 is more valuable than 4.0 x4. But PCIe 5.0 x2 or even 5.0 x4 is mostly pointless for consumers. A good PCIe 4.0 x4 SSD will be just as fast in real world use as the fastest PCIe 5.0 x4 SSD, and many of the best PCIe 3.0 x4 SSDs of the past keep up pretty well too. Microcenter sells the 990 EVO Plus 4TB and a decent enough price, so if you're looking to get a 4TB drive, it's a good option. Though really you could go with a Crucial P3 Plus and you're unlikely to notice the difference, even though that's on the slower end of PCIe 4.0 SSDs out there. I'd generally recommend a TeamGroup MP44, WD SN580, or SN770 over the 990 Evo Plus, as those are all very fast options that are much less expensive. But only the MP44 comes in 4TB, and Microcenter doesn't carry them.

For the PSU, go with the be quiet PURE POWER 12M instead of the MSI model. It's a higher quality unit even though it's less expensive. With a 9800X3D and 5080 you don't need more than an 850W.

"FYI my comment isn’t silly at all mate. Why? Because there’s almost no reason to go pcie 5.0 x2. Theoretically it provides the same amount of bandwidth as pcie 4.0 x4, just in fewer lanes. So unless you for some reason have a mobo or another part that needs to allocate bandwidth more efficiently, then going for the cheaper option(4 x4) is better. For gaming this literally couldn’t matter less. Even going pcie 5 x4 is waste of money, but it *does* offer double the amount of bandwidth. So even though it’s overkill, it could potentially be worth the investment. (while 5 x2 is just a waste of money)",fyi comment isnt silly mate there almost reason go pcie x theoretically provides amount bandwidth pcie x fewer lane unless reason mobo another part need allocate bandwidth efficiently going cheaper option x better gaming literally couldnt matter less even going pcie x waste money offer double amount bandwidth even though overkill could potentially worth investment x waste money

That said the bottom intake fans on the O11 are mostly for aesthetics.

"For a budget system there's nothing obvious wrong with the parts you have selected.

Minor tweaks and suggestions I recommend:

Motherboard - I'd probably look at spending a little more for a motherboard with two M.2 slots, just so you have the option of adding storage in the future w/o needing to keep SATA cables around. An ASRock B450M PRO4 for example might be a decent option for €89. That also gets you 4 RAM slots.

RAM - You can pretty safely go with 16GB for a build of this class. Very few games even need that, and the few that do are generally only when using a *lot* of mods (like Skyrim or Minecraft), or otherwise has a lot of user generated content (VRChat). 2x8GB 3200 CL16. If you need more in the future, it should be easy enough to buy another random 2x8GB 3200 CL16 or similar kit to get up to 32GB, and the Ryzen 5000 CPUs work very well with 4 sticks of RAM. It'll also help get you back down to below €600 with the upgraded motherboard.

SSD - 1TB isn't a lot these days and can fill up quickly with modern games. At this price point it's hard to afford much more, but that motherboard will at least let you upgrade a little easier.

GPU - The 6650 XT is a decent enough GPU. Right *now* is a rough time to be buying GPUs, used or otherwise, as new mid-range GPUs are due in the next month and it seems like the used market is going crazy with a combination of people dumping higher end GPUs for cheap, and low end GPUs for insane prices. €180 is pretty good. Not amazing, but at least not absolutely insane. One

"Great so far, slays about anything I throw at it. Only annoyances that have come up are driver issues (rarely) with new games.

Most recent I can think of

- Hell Divers
- Marvel Rivals

But if I recall correctly, it wasn't just an AMD issue. Same thing with a few Nvidia cards.

Driver update ship out pretty frequent. Outside of those two, can't think of remember any other issues I've had with the card.

Nothing I hadn't really run into with my 1080.

Also worth noting, there is no DLSS or cuda cores if you need any of that. I didn't, but some people do. Likewise ray tracing support is a bit better with Nvidia. You're probably already aware, but figure it's worth mentioning.
I really like the 24G of VRAM, mainly for some VR gear I want to get.

If it helps, here is everything I got for my current build. I've had it for a couple months shy of a year.

"Normal. 

You WANT your GPU hitting as close to 100% as often as possible when gaming. 

If you're streaming, then its even more reason why you want this to be happening. 

The nvenc encoder is taking already rendered frames from the frame buffer to encode it into a more efficient format that makes it easier to stream HD quality without taking a huge hit in performance to the GPU. It does take SOME processing from the GPU die to do it - but how much is negligible, people used to say it lower gaming performance by as much as 30% but these days you're not likely to even notice a 5% reduction when streaming with the nvenc encoder.

I think it should be enough but also, you are getting a 5090, if you are worried 64 isn't enough just get 2x48GB.

"I will say that getting a 4K monitor is basically a must with a 5090, otherwise you're wasting it's horsepower. It only really stretches it legs at 4K, as it gets CPU bottlenecked at lower resolutions. 

https://www.techpowerup.com/review/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition/33.html

For example, in TPUs benchmarks, who imo had the best and most expansive set of modern games in their testing, the 5090 is only 21% faster than the 4090 at 1440p but a more respectable 35% faster at 4K. Also note that it averages 147 fps in Native 4K raster; especially with DLSS 4, it's the first card that can really utilize those 4K 240 Hz OLEDs.",say getting k monitor basically must otherwise wasting horsepower really stretch leg k get cpu bottlenecked lower resolution httpswwwtechpowerupcomreviewnvidiageforcertxfounderseditionhtml example tpus benchmark imo best expansive set modern game testing faster p respectable faster k also note average fps native k raster especially dlss first card really utilize k hz oled
"Water-cooling with an AIO for the 9800x3d is completely fine and the pump sound won't be hearable unless your AIO is trash. The fans are what will create the noise so just get one with good quiet fans and you'll be fine.

OLED for sure on the screen is the nicest visual upgrade you can get in my opinion. Seeing true black and the vibrant colors, good refreshrate, and really makes it so you can't go back to other monitors. Amazing for gaming, movies/tv. Single ultra-wide or 2 monitors is literally just preference so you gotta figure that out. If you decide on two monitors, its definitely recommended to have 1 oled and 1 non-OLED though as OLEDs (eventually) burn in. Newer OLED panels are pretty good at preventing this though and last a long time with just some good diligence (turn your monitor off and let it refresh). With that set up if you play games on max settings and dlss/framegen you'll be prone to ghosting if you don't have a good monitor.

You can just throw your old storage into the PC it doesn't effect the speed really, just put windows/games on your fastest drive. They don't hold each other back, but the slower drives will stay slow. If you use multiple M.2 nvme ssds then you should make sure to get a motherboard that doesn't share lanes and cut each others bandwidth. PCIE 5.0 16x slot for your gpu that doesn't share bandwidth too.

Power supply just get a solid brand with good warranty and ratings online. I always try to buy one in person so it's easy to pick up and return if its faulty. Heard the 5090 will drain a lot of power so a 1k+ prob 1200 to be safe would be good. On the other hand the 9800x3d is amazing at undervolting and running efficient, so its a good pair. Make sure you get an 3.1 ATX/5.0 pcie compatible one so you can use the 12vh cable for the 5090. You definitely don't want to use the adapter. 

Just look up a good cooler that fits the aesthetic you want, or buy thermalright one if you want the best budget to quality. I cool my 9800x3d with it completely fine for like 50$.

"Make sure something is plugged into CPU_FAN header. Some motherboards don't boot without something plugged into the CPU_fan header and this is usually caused by ""where to plug AIO?"" I am positive that some AM4 boards do require a CPU_FAN to post and if you do not have one, it gives a CPU light. 

I don't think it'd result in an orange CPU light, but is the monitor plugged into the GPU and not the non-iGPU CPU? 

Unsure if you tried the CMOS battery itself.. So when unplugged and after capacitors have discharged, remove the CMOS battery if you haven't and leave it out for 10 seconds. You should check the RAM again, resetting CMOS each time (I've seen AM4 RAM issues be really finnicky with CMOS, especially on ASUS boards). 

An overly tightened CPU can cause issues. I've often heard it described as ""it should be finger tight, not hand tight."" I'd unscrew the cooler fully as it sounds like you plan on testing your old CPU anyways. With that gen of CPUs it should be safe to POST to BIOs with an unscrewed cooler and even without thermal paste, but I do recommend keeping the rad or AIO on top of the CPU.

"Yes, a single fan header can usually provide enough amps for 5 typical case fans.

If you connect all three with a splitter to the single header, only one fan will provide the tachometer signal back to the MB to determine fan speed, and all 3 fans' speed will be managed the same, as if it were just one fan.

This is fine if the fans are all of the same brand and type.

"4070 can spike at higher wattages depending on the individual part. The CPU can go up to 120W using boost clock which is essentially a built in overclock that activates under load.

PSUs lose efficiency and undergo more wear and tear the closer you get to 100% load from around 50% load where they are most efficient, typically. The less efficient a PSU is running, the more heat it produces and heat = wear and tear. The common advice is that you do not want to exceed 75-80% load on a PSU.

This is a matter of convention and common advice, though. I'm not an electrical engineer so I can't advise about how much risk there is... but if I were you I'd just avoid overclocking for now if you choose to upgrade.

"There should be resources out there and it's fairly novice friendly with something like MSI Afterburner. It took me about 10 minutes of research to find known stable underclocks (5700XT) when I recently did a build for a friend. In our case, it was thermal limiting a bit hotter than I'd have liked even with 100% fans and I sadly didn't have thermal pads or the time to do a repaste. I just entered provided voltage from a discussion post and was lucky that they were stable. Remember: not all equipment comes out of the factory equal, so what works for one person may not work for you (ie: 5% of people will have the bottom 5% of cards). 

I don't like to provide overclocking advice beyond that as there are a couple of things that can go wrong if you enter an unstable clock or voltage. Given that there is plenty of information available, *I'd rather let you determine if it is something you feel comfortable doing and send you to people who have worked with that specific card as I have not).* The key is that you may have to troubleshoot your way out of it. So if you can't find the information to set it up in the first place, I don't think it's a great idea to tell you to ""input these values here"" as it doesn't set someone up for success if they are the bottom 5% who has an issue. 

What tip I will add is that MSI Afterburner is an always running program and it needs to be running for an overclock to hold. So if you select ""start with windows"" and set an unstable underclock, it *can cause a windows boot loop.* That can usually be fixed by holding CTRL during the login screen, but sometimes requires other troubleshooting. So my tip there is: don't ""start with windows"" until you have a stable underclock.",resource fairly novice friendly something like msi afterburner took minute research find known stable underclocks xt recently build friend case thermal limiting bit hotter would liked even fan sadly thermal pad time repaste entered provided voltage discussion post lucky stable remember equipment come factory equal work one person may work ie people bottom card like provide overclocking advice beyond couple thing go wrong enter unstable clock voltage given plenty information available would rather let determine something feel comfortable send people worked specific card key may troubleshoot way find information set first place think great idea tell input value set someone success bottom issue tip add msi afterburner always running program need running overclock hold select start window set unstable underclock cause window boot loop usually fixed holding ctrl login screen sometimes requires troubleshooting tip start window stable underclock

Swapped to a a620, as long as if they upgrade to another 65w TDP CPU down the line and not a higher TDP CPU upgrades will be a non-issue as long as if the motherboard supports it. Beyond that the motherboard you linked didn't have wifi so I didn't see that as something that was needed. a620 boards don't support overclocking so that's not an option, nor PBO. If they are not tech savy enough to ask for help with parts on their own I probably wouldn't want them to enable this anyway as it's possible for overclocks to become unstable over time (PBO not excluded) which can cause system instability and diagnosing it if your not tech savy is unlikely. 

The motherboard swap was mainly just to free up funds to drop in a better GPU, this will work or a radeon 7600. I actually recommend a radeon rx 7600 instead as it has more mature drivers but the intel b570 can perform better in various games but intel is still working on the driver situation, it's a lot better in the past but it's not on par with radeon and nvidia for stability. I just put that one in there as something to look into as a potential.

If they need wifi and bluetooth, there are a lot of PCIE drop in cards available. Or you can search for one that has an Intel AX210 chipset which tends to go for around $20 and various no name companies sell it.

"Securing a new Nvidia graphics card like the RTX 5090 in the Netherlands (or anywhere else) can be a challenge due to high demand and limited supply, especially during the initial launch period. Here's an overview of what you might expect and some tips to improve your chances:

### Challenges
1. **High Demand**: New graphics cards often see massive demand, particularly from gamers and content creators.
2. **Supply Issues**: Production delays or supply chain issues can impact availability, leading to stock shortages.
3. **Resellers**: Some individuals may buy cards to resell at inflated prices, making it harder for regular consumers to purchase at retail prices.

### Launch Expectations
- **Pre-orders**: Many retailers may allow pre-orders. Stay informed about when they are offered.
- **Retailer Stock**: Expect many retailers to have limited quantities during the launch. 
- **Online and In-Store**: Both online purchases and in-store availability could be limited, so be flexible in your approach.

### Tips to Improve Your Odds
1. **Sign Up for Alerts**: Join mailing lists or follow social media accounts of major retailers and Nvidia for updates on availability.
   
2. **Use Stock Trackers**: Websites and Twitter accounts that track stock availability can help you know when cards are in stock.

3. **Join Community Forums**: Online communities (like Reddit threads or Discord channels) often share information about restocks.

4. **Be Prepared**: Have all your payment information ready and be logged into retailer accounts when the launch occurs.

5. **Diversify Sources**: Don’t rely on a single retailer; check multiple stores to increase your chances of finding stock.

6. **Consider Bundles**: Sometimes retailers bundle graphics cards with other products. While this is not ideal, it might increase your chances of getting the card.

7. **Set a Budget**: Be mindful of your budget and avoid overpaying from resellers. Prices can be significantly inflated.

8. **Stay Patient**: If you don’t get one immediately, don’t get discouraged. Restocks will happen, and prices might stabilize over time.

### Conclusion
While securing a 5090 at launch will be challenging due to demand and supply issues, being proactive and prepared can significantly increase your chances. Keep up with community news and stock alerts, and stay flexible with your purchasing options.

Furthermore, even if the factory somehow magically produces a huge number of chips immediately to supply US demand, unless the plant is building semiconductors mostly with robots then it will cost more than those Taiwanese microchips.

Morris Chang, TSMC’s founder, had previously said costs in the US microchip project would be far higher, and described it as an “expensive, wasteful exercise in futility”.

The microchip industry became dominated by Taiwan in the first place because of Taiwan's highly educated workforce, a different work/labor standard, and overall lower labor costs.

However, these tariff threats could all be just Trump's bluster and so maybe he doesn't intend to actually tariff them or tariff them for long. Even the US-Chinese trade war/tariff war during Trump's first term ended pretty quickly (partially because the Chinese counter tariffs were pretty damaging on the Trump supporting farmers who grew corn and soybeans).

Morris Chang is retired and has no access to TSMCs data. The company has entirely changed since he left. If TSMC wasn't going to make money in America they wouldn't have made a factory. 

>Furthermore, even if the factory somehow magically produces a huge number of chips immediately to supply US demand, unless the plant is building semiconductors mostly with robots then it will cost more than those Taiwanese microchips.

The estimated cost is like 10% more, with another fab on its way in 2028 potentially reducing costs even more. Either way, more factories and more production is always good.

My point still stands, chips will likely be much cheaper than you think when such ""tariffs"" are introduced.",morris chang tsmcs founder morris chang retired access tsmcs data company entirely changed since left tsmc going make money america would made factory furthermore even factory somehow magically produce huge number chip immediately supply u demand unless plant building semiconductor mostly robot cost taiwanese microchip estimated cost like another fab way potentially reducing cost even either way factory production always good point still stand chip likely much cheaper think tariff introduced
">Morris Chang is retired and has no access to TSMCs data. 

Morris Chang retired in 2018 and TSMC started planning to build factories in Arizona in 2020. I doubt the situation changed drastically to make the US go from unprofitably high labor costs to profitable labor costs within a mere 2 years. American work culture, labor issues and costs, etc. have been the same for years and will take many years to change.

>If TSMC wasn't going to make money in America they wouldn't have made a factory.

Look up the failed Foxconn investment in Wisconsin where they built a factory that was expected to create 13,000+ jobs...but ended up scaling down the project later and has ended up creating only a few hundred jobs. They already built a factory but then it turned out to be unprofitable so they abandoned it. The state of Wisconsin had given Foxconn a billion in subsidies to support their project.

There are a lot of considerations for a corporation to make a new factory - profitability from the private sector could only be one factor in the equation. Other factors includes the potential to get US subsidies and getting the support of US politicians/geopolitical benefits.

TSMC was actually given about 6.6 billion dollars in subsidies by the Biden administration to help build factories in Arizona in more recent years. Ironically, this was opposed by Trump.

Thus, besides the promise of govt subsidies, I wouldn't be surprised if the new factory was a way to decrease the chances of the USA tariffing Taiwanese products/companies by getting US political favor, and/or if it was done in exchange for under-the-table promises to protect Taiwan from China or sell Taiwan some new weapons.

>The estimated cost is like 10% more, with another fab on its way in 2028 potentially reducing costs even more. Either way, more factories and more production is always good.

More factories are good, but it won't come in time nor come in the sufficient quantities to offset the immediately incoming tariffs any time soon.

We have no idea how much the microchip tariffs will be either. Trump has been throwing out random big numbers like 25% to 100% tariffs. American TSMC production is not going to offset something like a 50% tariff on foreign TSMC microchips, let alone 100% tariff (especially when foreign TSMC production makes up the vast majority of chips in the world).

You might be right if those tariffs are coming several years from now or coming in 2028 if/when American TSMC production creates a significant number of chips every year.

">Morris Chang retired in 2018 and TSMC started planning to build factories in Arizona in 2020. I doubt the situation changed drastically to make the US go from unprofitably high labor costs to profitable labor costs within a mere 2 years.

From 2018 to 2020, the company more than doubled in value. From 2018 to 2025, the company has quintupled in value. Tell me again how the company couldn't have possibly changed.

Also gee...I can't imagine why the ultra-conservative, nationalist multi-billionaire wouldn't like his factories outside of his home country. I love how quick you are to trust this guy.

>American work culture, labor issues and costs, etc. have been the same for years and will take many years to change.

As compared to Taiwanese ""work culture"" where they just take advantage of their employees with strict anti-union policies and abusive employers. 

>Thus, besides the promise of govt subsidies, I wouldn't be surprised if the new factory was a way to decrease the chances of the USA tariffing Taiwanese products/companies by getting US political favor, and/or if it was done in exchange for under-the-table promises to protect Taiwan from China or sell Taiwan some new weapons.

I thought this was obvious.

>More factories are good, but it won't come in time nor come in the sufficient quantities to offset the immediately incoming tariffs any time soon.

"Just turn your output fans around ?? There's almost no reason to have ""exhaust"" fans with modern cases that are far from sealed.

">  The other 6 are pushing through radiators.

So, you're both making your AIO's as inefficient as possible by using warmed case air instead of fresh air from outside, AND, not bringing as much air  into the case as possible ? 

Pick which rad you want to be more efficient, OR whichever one is going to be for the less heat producing component and switch the fans on that from exhaust to intake. If it were mine, I'd try recording temps during highest stress situations, like OCCT psu test, for instance, then I'd turn all my fans to intake, record new readings, and see the difference. If it wasn't enough for me, I'd try only one AIO having the fans as exhaust, and the other as intake. Its the only way to figure out which produces the best results. Except for esthetic reasons, there's really no reason to buy ""reverse"" fans, just turn around whatever fans you have.",pushing radiator making aios inefficient possible using warmed case air instead fresh air outside bringing much air case possible pick rad want efficient whichever one going less heat producing component switch fan exhaust intake mine would try recording temp highest stress situation like occt psu test instance would turn fan intake record new reading see difference enough would try one aio fan exhaust intake way figure produce best result except esthetic reason really reason buy reverse fan turn around whatever fan

Cheapest CPU upgrade for gaming would be a 5700x3d. But that largely depends how you are playing games. Are you pushing to hit 240fps or similar high frame rates? Or are you maxing out visuals and running lower fps. If it's the maxing out visuals your GPU bound and CPU upgrade won't change much.,cheapest cpu upgrade gaming would xd largely depends playing game pushing hit fps similar high frame rate maxing visuals running lower fps maxing visuals gpu bound cpu upgrade change much

"The QVO is not a great SSD at all, it will throttle easier and harder than any Samsung NVME would. But you are not using it as OS drive, so doubt you will ever notice much as I also run games and programs off of it and it is just fine, as long as it is not the OS drive.

Second would be the CPU, 5700X3D/5800X3D would give the 3090 a better chance of maximising fps on AM4. The 3900X always was a bit of an oddball, because of the 6+6 core setup which is a bit half baked, exactly why I went with the 3950X (but I did get a 3080) and I am not upgrading any time soon. The X3Ds will have less brute multi core performance, but better single core power.

It is still a pretty powerful system, but it won't hold well to a 4090 + 9800X3D or (when available) a 5090 + 9950X3D, which will stomp it into the ground given the chance. For me the 3950X + 3080 is still plenty and I can run all professional programs I need as well as I can use it for gaming without feeling much of an upgrade urge a few years after buying. So... who cares there is (somewhat of a small) bottleneck?",qvo great ssd throttle easier harder samsung nvme would using o drive doubt ever notice much also run game program fine long o drive second would cpu xdxd would give better chance maximising fps x always bit oddball core setup bit half baked exactly went x get upgrading time soon xds less brute multi core performance better single core power still pretty powerful system hold well xd available xd stomp ground given chance x still plenty run professional program need well use gaming without feeling much upgrade urge year buying care somewhat small bottleneck

"So the reason for recommending 5700 etc is because the MB is AM4 Locked correct? If I had a board with a different socket I could push further with the CPU? Just trying to understand how this works. 

Also would my MB be able to run DDR5 RAM or would it be too dated to do that too?",reason recommending etc mb locked correct board different socket could push cpu trying understand work also would mb able run ddr ram would dated
"Fair enough. I guess my question was more what’s my weakest link, A.K.A what would I want to replace first if I was replacing things one by one",fair enough guess question whats weakest link aka would want replace first replacing thing one one
"If gaming is your main use the 5700x3d or a 5800x3d if you find one for a deal in the used market. Some games see huge gains from x3d cache. If you did more then gaming 5900x is also a valid drop in. 

But you can check if your GPU is being helpful back on what ever game by watching it's usage if you have a second monitor you can use task manager hwinfo64 etc. if you only have one you will have to use an overlay with GPU usage. Make sure fps is not capped when testing. 90-100% gpu usage then everything is good. If lower then the GPU is being helpful back a reasonable amount and the lower it is the more so.",gaming main use xd xd find one deal used market game see huge gain xd cache gaming x also valid drop check gpu helpful back ever game watching usage second monitor use task manager hwinfo etc one use overlay gpu usage make sure fps capped testing gpu usage everything good lower gpu helpful back reasonable amount lower
"in general, 1440p is the transition area where gpu starts mattering more than cpu; at 4k there is little point in upgrading the cpu, it's mostly gpu carrying the load at that point.

since you want 170fps, i'd be evaluating gpu for the specific games you want to play... i can tell you that running cyberpunk at 4k on a 4090, with all the eye candy on and dlss, is 90-110fps situation.

that minecraft situation sounds a bit weird, perhaps there are running processes in the background that are dragging the pc down?",general p transition area gpu start mattering cpu k little point upgrading cpu mostly gpu carrying load point since want fps id evaluating gpu specific game want play tell running cyberpunk k eye candy dlss fps situation minecraft situation sound bit weird perhaps running process background dragging pc
"Locked is a bit of a weird term to use, because there is literally no way of using another socket; it is a platform with AM4 sockets and only AM4. DDR5 is locked to the platform like DDR4 and DD3 before that. AM4 works with DDR4, AM5 works with DDR5, 1700 works with both DDR4 and DDR5 but the motherboard is either, not both. If you would get an AM5 motherboard, you need an AM5 CPU and DDR5, yes. Cheapest is upgrading within AM4.",locked bit weird term use literally way using another socket platform socket ddr locked platform like ddr dd work ddr work ddr work ddr ddr motherboard either would get motherboard need cpu ddr yes cheapest upgrading within
That’s really good to know! Thank you for the helpful answers. I already asked someone else but the reason the 57/5800 are what you’re recommending is because my MB is AM4 locked correct?,thats really good know thank helpful answer already asked someone else reason youre recommending mb locked correct
"Yea basically the best gaming CPU you can drop into the motherboard without upgrading the full platform is 5800x3d/5700x3d. If you do stuff other than gaming the highest is 5950x and cheaper option 5900x.

As far as ram your pretty maxed out on speed. 3600 is about as fast that will comfortably run in 1:1 sync which is something you can check on your current set up download zen timings and see if fclk is showing 1800 if not you will have to manually set it to 1800 to match the 3600 m/t.

If you have money to burn the upgrade would be 9800x3d on an am5 mobo x870/e or x670/e and a set of ddr5 6000cl30",yea basically best gaming cpu drop motherboard without upgrading full platform xdxd stuff gaming highest x cheaper option x far ram pretty maxed speed fast comfortably run sync something check current set download zen timing see fclk showing manually set match mt money burn upgrade would xd mobo xe xe set ddr cl

I think what you might want to do is buy a new monitor with 1440p120hz or [this monitor](https://www.amazon.com/MSI-G27C4X-DisplayPort-Anti-Flicker-Anti-Glare/dp/B0BX1X4382/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3D43BALCBPYXS&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.hcSdPas3bBy_7Z5i-3G2DkrnQEyR7G_EeK-rt3o05KXIEjOoVweo2VLvXL4Nfdf2nQ_Ugod02WBrY-q01JsC4wnGX4LnUo1xMoRRZncVvz3XKKlNH5apyrbiFu91DTlS6qd6amOVdrs4DINsHYGM1j8mIu0zaP9_T1RXsrqqb0oWs4m7MxlJJK3NtFzlzK21wKTpf8FfzRB_dv_QuWWQ53BnqNBFVAfF20R1W1eWk1w.3fS3npns2QW2XagWfwCYYPtbDrQn9T45sADLQ1qGAOI&dib_tag=se&keywords=msi%2Bmonitor&qid=1738094714&sprefix=msi%2Bmonito%2Caps%2C159&sr=8-1&th=1).

"It doesn't really make a difference which brands of CPUs and GPUs are combined. That's a myth in this day and age.

Intel used to be king of CPUs, but have fallen off their throne due to degradation issues with their 13th and 14th gen LGA1700 CPUs and poor pricing on their new gen. 

AMD's AM5 x3d (7600x3d, 7800x3d or 9800x3d) CPUs are undisputably the best for gaming. But any AM5 CPU is still a good choice due to the upgrade potential of their still young socket. 

And as I mentioned gpu-wise it's a contest. Nvidia is still considered the premium product and have better performance in ray tracing and upscaling and some professional workloads. Meanwhile AMD offers better raw performance for dollar and is much more generous with vram.

"When you have a budget that low, you're not going to get anything other than ""mostly crap"" when it comes to a mechanical keyboard.

If you want something good, save up more money. If you can't save up another $50-$100, having a good mechanical keyboard should not be a priority.

Go to amazon and look for ""SteelSeries Apex 3 RGB Gaming Keyboard"". There's some on sale right now for $35 which is within your budget, but it's a 100% keyboard, not 75.

There's also ""Apex 3 TKL RGB Gaming Keyboard"" which is $42 right now. It's got 87 keys. so everything but the number pad.

Trust me, I've looked around. For what you want, you're going to need a higher budget. Of course, i was personally looking for wireless and a full keyboard because i need it for my workflow in a bunch of different programs and games. I also found out I hated switches with light acuation and loud sounds, so I had to buy silent linear switches and heavy springs to make them heavier and less sensitive...and I wanted good looking custom keys. Excluding the custom keys, I probably spent about $250 getting what I wanted.

But if you can just save up a little more money, some good brands where you can get something for like $70 to $80 would be Ducky. I haven't used them myself though. I've heard about being good quality.  For your budget though, there's Red Dragon and Womier. I have Womier Keycaps, but I have no idea if their boards are any good. I see a 60% one for $25.

"Alright I'll tell you my situation(see my other posts dor more detailed info). In a minor saving money for a decent pc that doenst run like dogshit like my actual 8yo laptop, target is 1000€ total for pc and monitor, and ill ask some more for a keyboard, but for now its more like show money to get my parents to pay for what i want for me, not what they want for me, since its not a big issue for them to pay about 500 bucks for my causes like summer trips from a group i go to. Spending that money on a keyboard would drastically alter performance, and I'm edging 1440p territory with a 6700xt  unless I get a better option once the current market stabilizes out.

I belive those are membrane keyboards but I'm not sure. Each has their taste in switches, I hate my membranes for being slow and unreliable, anythings an upgrade, I even tried a dumpster clicky keyboard but unfortunately a key I needed didn't work, but it was better, and mainly ergonomically since I made a self designed paltop stand to lift the monitor so my neck doesn't suffer from laptop ergonomics. And from what I tested I like most light tactiles, I don't want clickies, linear are fine but I gota get used to them and I never could, so I can't say anything really about my preferences on them, I'll use what I'll get.

"I've seen doubleshot keycaps on some cheap ones, ofc there are ones that ate the cheapest of the cheap, but it's a matter of buying a cheap keycap set, they aren't that expensive.

And do I need software? I mean, I just need the drivers to run it, I'm not gonna do any macros and I don't care about rgb, I just need some backlight, it's not an HE keyboard where I have to tinker with it to reach my preffered settings.

Since I'm not too into keyboards and I'm a hard stuck membrane keyboard user, I think anything is an upgrade to my slow and sometimes non registering keyboard. I do prefer slight tactile, probably because of how used I am to membrane, but still, a small bump like mx browns have(i tested them in a store) is what I want, no heavy stuff like I see many writers want with tactiles.

"I'm assuming the M.2 port in your board already filled? 

Honestly this isn't a great plan. The secondary x16 slot on your board runs PCIe2.0 and has four lanes allocated to it. Assuming you're going to be using a PCIe3.0 drive, that means it will have only half of the bandwidth that it expects. If you then put a PCIe Wifi card, that slot then will only run in x2 mode, meaning that a PCIe3 drive will only have 25% of its expected bandwidth. 

If you're using a PCIe4 drive, it's worse - it will only have 12.5% of its expected bandwidth. 

You could DO this, but I would use a USB wifi adapter to avoid the PCIe slot running in x2 mode. There isn't much difference for most folks running a PCIe3 or PCIe4 drive, but the difference likely will be noticeable if you cut the available bandwidth in-half by using the PCIe Wifi card.",assuming port board already filled honestly great plan secondary x slot board run pcie four lane allocated assuming going using pcie drive mean half bandwidth expects put pcie wifi card slot run x mode meaning pcie drive expected bandwidth using pcie drive worse expected bandwidth could would use usb wifi adapter avoid pcie slot running x mode much difference folk running pcie pcie drive difference likely noticeable cut available bandwidth inhalf using pcie wifi card
"It can be done, but there are issues that one should probably consider. The available slots on the board (except for the main graphics card slot) are all PCIe2.0 and the lane configuration is 4/1/1. 

However, if you use either of the x1 slots, the secondary slot (x16 slot configured as x4) drops to x2. So putting something like a PCIe3 drive on a M.2 adapter, you'd already be losing 50% of the bandwidth form the PCIe2 interface. Putting a wifi adapter in will cut another 1/2 of the bandwidth from that.",done issue one probably consider available slot board except main graphic card slot pcie lane configuration however use either x slot secondary slot x slot configured x drop x putting something like pcie drive adapter would already losing bandwidth form pcie interface putting wifi adapter cut another bandwidth

"Assuming the primary task is gaming, I would actually look at the 7600X rather than the 7700X as it's not much different for gaming than a 7700X. 

As for the choice of CPU between a 7800X3D and a 7600X...tough call honestly. If the monitor resolution is 1440p or higher, then the 7800X3D is likely overkill, but could be nice to have in the event you're trying to achieve super high (i.e. >180) FPS in some situations. 

However, if you're able to do something like downgrade to a 7600X, and use the savings to get an upgrade elsewhere (i.e. going from 1TB SSD to 2TB, or going from a crap power supply to something good), then the money would probably be better allocated that way. 

I see in the US that the difference between a 7600X and a 7800X3D is about $260. It's very possible that is within the difference between a 4070S and a 4070 TiS, and honestly it's likely that (again depending on the resolution and games you play) a 4070 TiS will do more for you than a 7800X3D upgrade will.",assuming primary task gaming would actually look x rather x much different gaming x choice cpu xd xtough call honestly monitor resolution p higher xd likely overkill could nice event trying achieve super high ie fps situation however able something like downgrade x use saving get upgrade elsewhere ie going tb ssd tb going crap power supply something good money would probably better allocated way see u difference x xd possible within difference ti honestly likely depending resolution game play ti xd upgrade

Intel b580 is a great choice ***if*** you have a modern enough, powerful enough CPU.  But you currently have 750ti - that tells me you're probably not running a 9800x3d 😅

Nvidia 4060 is around 300-350, I think.  It's modern and supports ray tracing, dlss4 upscaling and single frame frame generation.  Buuuuuut it's not got much VRAM.

AMD 7600 is in your price range and supports upto fsr3.1 but not the about to be released fsr4 upscaling.  Fsr 3 is not as good as dlss in almost all examples.  Also AMD cards aren't as good at ray tracing.

(Ray tracing is becoming far more prevalent in games, and there are even games that are coming out that have it as a minimum requirement... In the early days, ray tracing was a gimmick.  Not any more, I'm afraid 😟)

With a low budget like that, you're probably better off going second hand...

As such, Nvidia 3080 will perform rather well across the board.  AMD 6800xt or better will perform slightly better than the 3080 in older, rasterised games, but the 3080 will perform a LOT better in raytraced games.

"1) yes, that's what I said?!  And I quote from my previous comment, ""But you currently have 750ti - that tells me you're probably not running a 9800x3d 😅"" ...  That's a British gently sarcastic way of saying that he probably has a very dated CPU that will also need an upgrade.


2) But at the same time, ***Not necessarily*** buddy... The guy's on a budget, clearly...  But if he had a suitable CPU at release of the 750ti, he'd have a 4770k, or there about...  And yes, I wouldn't run a 4770k now.

Buuuuuut hé might've upgraded the CPU/mobo in the meantime.  Even just 1 generation newer, the 5930k, is suitable for the 3080.  Sure, he'd struggle a bit with some modern titles, but you'd be surprised what the 5930k can still handle.

I didn't upgrade my 5930k until 12th Gen released... And I only did that because one, ***ONE***, game dropped below 90fps in the first few seconds of a race in VR.  (I was playing Automobilista 2 a lot, and in the first few seconds of a race, where all the cars were bunched up, it was slightly choppy... After 5 seconds, it was absolutely fine.  This is because it runs all the physics of vehicles on screen on one core.)...

Every other game was still fine.  I'd hazard a guess that it'd still be absolutely fine now.  (It was overclocked, of course, to 4.6ghz, and was running manually tuned quad channel ddr4 3200c13 (originally 4400c19 slowed to 3200 and manually tightened all timings to c12-c13 equivalent).

My point being, if the OP is a savvy hardware buyer, he could be running a 8-9 year old CPU (or newer) that isn't terribly useless today.  And coupled with a 3080 or 6800xt+ it would still rock.  (Although I'd personally go with 3080 now, even though the 6800xt was the better choice at release, because RT back then was less prevalent, but will soon become mandatory, for example Indian Jones minimum spec requires RT capability.  And AMD 6000 series GPU's ***suck*** at RT)

....

And if he's running an AMD 3000+ series with his 750ti (a few years after the 750ti was released, but lots of people upgrade cycle their CPU - GPU - CPU, instead of building one all-new PC outright), then he's also going to be fine with the 30 series Nvidia or 6000 series and GPU.  (And, yes, he could also upgrade the CPU to 5700x3d / 5800x3d, but a 3600x with oc fclk to 1900mhz and manually tuned 3800mts ram would still be pretty sweet today also!)",yes said quote previous comment currently ti tell probably running xd thats british gently sarcastic way saying probably dated cpu also need upgrade time necessarily buddy guy budget clearly suitable cpu release ti would k yes would run k buuuuuut h might upgraded cpumobo meantime even generation newer k suitable sure would struggle bit modern title would surprised k still handle upgrade k th gen released one one game dropped fps first second race vr playing automobilista lot first second race car bunched slightly choppy second absolutely fine run physic vehicle screen one core every game still fine would hazard guess would still absolutely fine overclocked course ghz running manually tuned quad channel ddr c originally c slowed manually tightened timing cc equivalent point op savvy hardware buyer could running year old cpu newer terribly useless today coupled xt would still rock although would personally go even though xt better choice release rt back less prevalent soon become mandatory example indian jones minimum spec requires rt capability amd series gpus suck rt running amd series ti year ti released lot people upgrade cycle cpu gpu cpu instead building one allnew pc outright also going fine series nvidia series gpu yes could also upgrade cpu xd xd x oc fclk mhz manually tuned mt ram would still pretty sweet today also

"Welcome to modern processors!

AMD Ryzen chips pack a lot of different features and behaviours that keep the chip performing well even when it's ""idle"". That higher than expected voltage is the CPU keeping one core ready in a high power state for clearing out background work and on-demand pings, while the rest of the CPU sleeps. This shows off as big spikes in clock speeds for the core that is doing that job, and those spikes need a lot of voltage. Ryzen Master differs in reporting from that other tool you're looking at, since it aggregates the core voltages instead of reporting the highest value. 

Under all core workloads, like those Cinebench stress tests, the CPU needs to distribute the available power limit to all cores in the CPU while keeping an eye on thermals. This results in an average decrease in voltage since clocks are lower across the whole chip. 

In BIOS, power management is in a preliminary state and the reporting is showing off what the CPU is stuck at (since it's doing barely anything, including power management). 

Everything described above is safe, normal, and expected. Do not worry :)",welcome modern processor amd ryzen chip pack lot different feature behaviour keep chip performing well even idle higher expected voltage cpu keeping one core ready high power state clearing background work ondemand ping rest cpu sleep show big spike clock speed core job spike need lot voltage ryzen master differs reporting tool looking since aggregate core voltage instead reporting highest value core workload like cinebench stress test cpu need distribute available power limit core cpu keeping eye thermal result average decrease voltage since clock lower across whole chip bios power management preliminary state reporting showing cpu stuck since barely anything including power management everything described safe normal expected worry

"Okay so PCI cards actually have different speeds like PCI3, PCI4, and PCI5. The speed, or generation, just doesn't change all that often. A few years ago, the industry shifted from PCI3 to PCI4, with PCI4 being faster. So almost everything available today is PCI4.


The industry is CURRENTLY SHIFTING to PCI5. That means, not everything is PCI5 yet, in fact VERY FEW components are PCI5. It's a brand new standard.


The X870/9800X3D platform does support PCI5, so in the future you can use PCI5 graphics cards and SSD's, and enjoy the extra speed. However, because this is new technology, most motherboards only support 1 or 2 slots of PCI5 at maximum speed, the rest of them split the speeds between them(sharing lanes).



So what this means is, in 2-5 years time, most graphics cards will likely be PCI5, and they'll need to be run on a PCI5 lane to get the maximum performance. A 9800X3D mother board that you buy today, can run that ""future card"" with PCI5, BUT ONLY if nothing else in your system is using PCI5. Since your two SSD's are PCI4, then this won't be a problem unless you plan to upgrade them in the next 2-5 years. But personally, I don't think you'll need too, PCI4 for SSD's will be plenty fast even for next gen games in my opinion.


So you can buy essentially whatever 9800X3D board that you want, and everything today will work fine. In the future, you might want PCI5 for a graphics card update(like in 2028), so it would be good to buy a board that supports PCI5 today. 


But even in the future, PCI4 will still work, you'll just lose a small amount of performance(2-4% based on today's testing).


So buy whatever board you want. It's nice to have PCI5, but without it you aren't really losing anything. It's just a nice thing to have for ""future proofing"".",okay pci card actually different speed like pci pci pci speed generation change often year ago industry shifted pci pci pci faster almost everything available today pci industry currently shifting pci mean everything pci yet fact component pci brand new standard xxd platform support pci future use pci graphic card ssds enjoy extra speed however new technology motherboards support slot pci maximum speed rest split speed themsharing lane mean year time graphic card likely pci need run pci lane get maximum performance xd mother board buy today run future card pci nothing else system using pci since two ssds pci problem unless plan upgrade next year personally think need pci ssds plenty fast even next gen game opinion buy essentially whatever xd board want everything today work fine future might want pci graphic card updatelike would good buy board support pci today even future pci still work lose small amount performance based today testing buy whatever board want nice pci without really losing anything nice thing future proofing

"First off, lane sharing is caused when the motherboard tries to offer more features than it has PCIE lanes for.   There are a couple forms of lane sharing.  One form borrows lanes from the GPU slot if you use certain features on the motherboard.  Most commonly, this is how they offer more than one PCIE5-capable M.2 slot (by taking lanes from the GPU slot).  Usually, this causes the GPU slot to drop from x16 to x8 (which is nearly always of no consequence at all - see discussion below).

In the current AM5 boards, lane sharing is more common on boards that offer USB4 connectivity (all x870 boards and some B850 boards) because that USB4 connectivity needs some of the fast CPU-connected PCIE5 lanes.  Choosing a board without USB4 will likely have less lane sharing.

People are afraid of lane sharing with the GPU slot when they really shouldn't be most of the time.  First off, all 50 series GPUs are PCIE5 so if you buy a new motherboard with a PCIE5x16 GPU slot, even if that gets dropped to PCIE5x8 with lane sharing, you have more than enough bandwidth for all 50 series boards including the 5090. In fact, it's not even close.  Lots and lots of reserve bamdwidth even at 5x8.  The 4090 is the only known GPU that is impacted slightly by running in a x8 slot (because it's only PCIE4) and even then it's only a few percent difference.

So, unless you'll be running a 4090, any motherboard with a PCIE5x16 GPU slot will be perfectly fine, even if you cause lane sharing which drops it to x8.

If you want three M2. drives, then you should probably look for a  board that offers one PCIE5x4 M.2 drive and two PCIE4x4 drives that don't cause any lane sharing at all or don't cause any lane sharing that would impact you.

"So the internet has decided motherboards that can divert 8 of the 16 pcie lanes from the GPU for other purposes (like m.2 drives) are bad because you could bottleneck your GPU. In many cases though, this is a good thing to do because AMD really doesn't provide enough pcie lanes, and cutting the GPU's lanes in half has virtually no performance penalty. The less powerful GPU is, the less of an effect it has. A 4090 will take a low single digit performance hit from 8 as opposed to 16 PCIe 4.0 lanes. Maybe a 4080 will have a measurable difference. I know if it's minimal with a 4090, it can only be less significant with a 4080. This is also likely to be a non-issue with PCIe 5.0 cards. 8 lanes of 5.0 is equivalent to 16 lanes of 4.0.


Jayztwocents just did a video on this with a 5090. https://youtu.be/WWfjoGZmrTo?si=z7uWHBnzaJ-YI-Ov Remember though that it supports pcie 5.0. So if you put that card into a strix B650E-E and filled all the M.2 slots so only 8 lanes go to the GPU, it would be running at the equivalent of 4.0 x 16, where a 40 series card would be running at the equivalent of 3.0 x 16 (actually 4.0 x 8 but effectively the same). But the point is look how little difference it makes when you limit NVIDIA's flagship to 3.0 x 16.



I do know that the less expensive a motherboard is, the less likely it is to have PCIe switches on the graphics lanes. If you think this is an issue, just buy a cheaper motherboard and rest assured all 16 lanes will be hardwired to the graphics card. Try the ASRock B850 Pro-A or Pro RS. Avoid X870 because you probably have no use for thunderbolt and you automatically lose 4 lanes (the equivalent of an m.2) to a Thunderbolt (AKA USB4) controller.

"The AM5 chipsets seem limited by the number of PCIe lanes available for various ports. The tradeoffs seem to be:

* Get PCIe5.0 x16 slot and several M.2 (PCIe5.0), but not at the same time (x16 slot downgraded to X8 if certain M.2 slots are used)

or

* Get PCIe5.0 x16 slot and several slower M.2 (PCIe4.0) slots with no lane sharing.

I think the PCIe4.0 (and slower) slots go through the chipset, so the bandwidth for those is shared with everything else going through the chipset.

"x870 tomahawk does have lane sharing, just not with the primary GPU PCIe slot.

This is directly from the spec sheet:

** USB 40Gbps Type-C ports on the back panel and M2_2 slot share PCIe 5.0 x4 bandwidth. Both run at PCIe 5.0 x2 when a device is installed in the M2_2 slot. You can switch M2_2 to PCIe 5.0 x4 in the BIOS, but this will disable the USB 40Gbps Type-C ports. The USB4 host controller supports up to PCIe 4.0 x4.

*** PCI_E3 slot will run at x2 speed when installing device in the M2_3 slot. You can switch PCI_E3 slot to x4 in the BIOS, but this will disable the M2_3 slot.

TLDR:

 using the 2nd m.2 slot cuts the bandwidth of the USB C port on the back to 20 gbps.

 using the 3rd m.2 slot cuts the bandwidth of the last PCIe slot in half.

If you are only using two m.2 drives, you should use slots m.2 slots 1 and 4 to prevent any lane sharing or splitting. However, for me personally, neither of those 2 splits are a problem, so using four m.2 was fine.

"I would recommend the X870 chipset (without E), and more specifically, the MSI MAG X870 Tomahawk WiFi.

It’s a nice balance between being future proof and cost. For example, you won’t need a PCIe 5.0 slot for the 4080 Super, but who knows, you may upgrade a couple of years down the line and it might be nice to have 5.0 for a new graphics card (whether it’s going to be actually utilizing the higher bandwidth or not is another story). 

The MSI motherboard has the primary M.2 slot between CPU and first PCI slot, so even if you use a M.2 with cooler (or upgrade to one later), it should fit (reasonable cooler…).

The first 2 M.2 slots are PCIe 5.0, the other 2 are PCIe 4.0. Note that the 3rd PCIe slot and the 3rd M.2 slot share PCIe lanes - if you install an M.2 in it, the PCIe slot bandwidth will be reduced. Usually not a problem unless you have some sort of extension card in there (network, or M.2 expansion, or whatever). Anyway, once you upgrade to a PCIe 5.0 M2 as your boot device, you can continue using the old one as a data drive or convenient local backup drive - just move it to the bottom slot, and you’ll have 4 M.2 drives.

It will support 6000 mt/s RAM but I generally recommend not to overclock your RAM beyond what your CPU is spec’ed for. The 9800x3d is spec’ed for DDR-5 5600. I am being overly cautious given some of the RAM/CPU issues in the not too distant past. For gaming, it generally means a negligible loss of frames, the benefit is that you are staying within spec and power limits.

I would try reseating your RAM and CPU just make sure they were properly inserted. Sometimes RAM can look like it is fully seated but slightly sticking out.

Be sure to read up/watch videos on this process before proceeding with it.

In regards to the cooler, it is important to have it plugged in, as it can sometimes cause the system to not boot if it doesn't detect a cooler. I would personally just put the cooler on just to keep it safe, but as long as it's plugged in during boot, it shouldn't cause any issues.

I have a 4070 ti super. I upgrade from a 3080ti and it is amazing. The dlss4 in certain titles is a gamechanger too. Like for instance they have it on skyrim vr there use to be like weird shaking going on with lines and stuff on objects it's no longer there it's smooth and clearer. I got it back in December for $750 new. I bios flashed it to strix oc so I can get %128 power limit and I run it at 3030mhz with +2000 mem and it's about 1fps less then a 4080 and in some games beats it.

"I bought the 4070 ti s in june. I was considering the 4070s, but decided against this because of longevity (even though it currently is the most cost effective card). The 4080s was a few hundred dollars more expensive for diminishing returns (and also had 16GB vram).
I still think to this day that picking a 4070 ti s is a great middle ground. Great performance, good longevity.
In this case I would ask myself: do you want to spend another 70 dollars for extra longevity?  12gb of vram might be a limiting factor a lot sooner than the 16gb vram (that is: when this becomes a limiting factor). Is another 70 dollars worth the extra year or so of playing on higher settings?
Nice extra is that the 4070 ti s is also a stronger card in performance ofc :)",bought ti june considering decided longevity even though currently cost effective card hundred dollar expensive diminishing return also gb vram still think day picking ti great middle ground great performance good longevity case would ask want spend another dollar extra longevity gb vram might limiting factor lot sooner gb vram becomes limiting factor another dollar worth extra year playing higher setting nice extra ti also stronger card performance ofc

"FWIW, part of the problem is that the advertised MSRP's for new GPUs aren't really ""real"" anymore. Yes, a few lucky people will be able to buy MSRP cards on launch day, or in the few weeks after. But very soon after that initial stock is exhausted, the new 50-series cards pricing will be ballpark 20% higher than MSRP.

This will make the remaining stock of the 40-series look like a deal at the exact same prices as they're currently being sold for. And once the 40-series stock is finally exhausted, it's not like retailers/Nvidia are going to drop the 50-series pricing back down to MSRP.

That's my evaluation of how it typically works.",fwiw part problem advertised msrps new gpus really real anymore yes lucky people able buy msrp card launch day week soon initial stock exhausted new series card pricing ballpark higher msrp make remaining stock series look like deal exact price currently sold series stock finally exhausted like retailersnvidia going drop series pricing back msrp thats evaluation typically work

"Since you’re new there are a few things you should be aware of, the first is 1440p won’t look as good on a 4k monitor as it would on a 1440p monitor. 4k looks best on 4K monitor, 1440p looks best on 1440p monitor and 1080p looks best on 1080p monitor. This is good to know so you get the best out of the resolution you intend to play at.

You would also be aware of upscaling such as FSR and DLSS. AI upscaling solutions are better so DLSS and FSR4 are going to be much better than FSR 3. This is something you should do some research on so you know more about these technologies as they are very important for gaming these days. For example a lot of people use DLSS quality mode at 1440p to play at 1080p speeds with almost native 1440p quality.

It sounds to me that you need to do some more research to understand what you need and want from your system.",since youre new thing aware first p wont look good k monitor would p monitor k look best k monitor p look best p monitor p look best p monitor good know get best resolution intend play would also aware upscaling fsr dlss ai upscaling solution better dlss fsr going much better fsr something research know technology important gaming day example lot people use dlss quality mode p play p speed almost native p quality sound need research understand need want system

"It seemed to me with resolution and upscaling technologies. I think in your case with a 4k monitor you might be best off with a 7900xt which can be had for an absolute bargain. It has amazing performance and most importantly 20gb of vram (which is going to be great for 4k gaming).

Hear me out on this, even though FSR 3.5 is not as good as DLSS at lower resolutions such as 1440p and 1080p the disparity between these two technologies is much less at 4k in terms of quality. What you could do is run games at FSR balanced mode (which will allow you to run games as fast as 1440p) and have yourself a beastly 4k machine instead. FSR balanced at 4k looks better than 1440p native from my understanding and would look much better on your 4k monitor. Those are just my thoughts. Basically this setup when used this way would allow you to get 100+ fps in many games at 4k with the use of FSR.

The reasons I bring this up is I recently got into PC gaming again about a year ago and had to learn about upscaling. It really is a huge game changer.",seemed resolution upscaling technology think case k monitor might best xt absolute bargain amazing performance importantly gb vram going great k gaming hear even though fsr good dlss lower resolution p p disparity two technology much less k term quality could run game fsr balanced mode allow run game fast p beastly k machine instead fsr balanced k look better p native understanding would look much better k monitor thought basically setup used way would allow get fps many game k use fsr reason bring recently got pc gaming year ago learn upscaling really huge game changer
"Lastly, if you want to spend a little bit more you could do the same thing with the 4070 Ti Super and 5070 Ti. Both have 16gb of VRAM which is sufficient and will have DLSS 4 soon which is superior to FSR3. This of course would be a premium pick if you go that route and what I would also do.

"1) a PSU is one of those components that *probably* needs constant, **active** cooling, especially under load. Being enclosed means that it cannot take advantage of the air-flow from the rest of your computer's case.  

2) ""cheaper"" PSUs may be louder than costlier ones. more-expensive PSUs will have higher-quality fans with improved bearing systems and may even have buttons/toggles to adjust/control fan speed.

3) most consumer (non-server, non-workstation) PSUs I've used were pretty darn quiet, already. With many being nearly or completely silent. 

I have an ""[EVGA SuperNOVA 750 G2](https://www.evga.com/articles/archive/00823/default.asp)"" PSU. It has a toggle button to change its 140mm fan from ""Quiet"" to ""Silent"". It cost $99 back when I got it in 2017. I cannot even hear it unless I put my head directly up to it on the back of my computer. EVGA doesn't list the fan dB, only that the PSU has ""**Zero Fan Noise**"".

After upgrading my system components in November (went from a 300W build to a 500W build), I actually changed it from its ""Silent"" setting back to the noisier ""Quiet"" setting to increase air-flow and ensure the PSU stayed cooler. I can feel more air coming out of, but I still cannot hear it.

Basically:

* what PSU do you have?       
* what did it cost?       
* if total-silence is *required*, are you willing to pay more for a PSU?     

The comedy option is to open the PSU and *disconnect the fan*.

"Traditionally, most components of any kind experience the greatest amount of damage when they are first turned on. Thus a fan going from 0rpm to say 100rpm 100 times a day will likely fail faster than one just running at 100rpm minimum. 

In the case of a fan (which is pwm powered) intuitively you can imagine this to be because any pwm motor draws its highest possible current the closer it is to 0 rpm. It also develops the most power at 0 rpm, and is also generally the least efficient. Thus the fan and all its pieces experience the highest torque, highest power drawn and highest heat generated when turning on at 0 rpm.",traditionally component kind experience greatest amount damage first turned thus fan going rpm say rpm time day likely fail faster one running rpm minimum case fan pwm powered intuitively imagine pwm motor draw highest possible current closer rpm also develops power rpm also generally least efficient thus fan piece experience highest torque highest power drawn highest heat generated turning rpm

There are dozens of detailed timings that make DRAM work and the memory controller is given one set of timings for all  your RAM, but you would have two different memory chips that probably don't use the same timings.  In that case, the only way for either the motherboard (to try to figure it out by itself) or you (if you're customizing the timings) is to set the lowest common denominator (slowest settings for both speed and timings) to try to find something that would work for both kinds of chips and then you'd have to make sure and do a pretty thorough stability test.",recommendation new x set replace get new x ddr set unclear mixed set dimms work without slowing speed andor customizing timing dozen detailed timing make dram work memory controller given one set timing ram would two different memory chip probably use timing case way either motherboard try figure customizing timing set lowest common denominator slowest setting speed timing try find something would work kind chip would make sure pretty thorough stability test

That memory choice is optimistic at best, and unnecessarily expensive.

There's no need to spend extra on ""Domintor"" memory, and you have massive L3 cache making it even more trivial than it already is. Not to mention it's illogical to aim for borderline stability speeds/timing when your workloads should prioritize stability first. 

Are you working with large, single files with sustained read and writes? If not, then those drives don't make any sense.

The 5700x3d is the same socket as the 3600x so no need to completely swap your motherboard.

For reference: using my old rig, I could play games like Cyberpunk 2077 at 1080p with decent FPS at medium settings. Space Marine 2 ran fine at 1080p with low-medium settings. Helldivers 2 was fine at the higher end of medium settings.

The extra 2gb of vram you will have with the 3080 FE might make a small difference in how high you can run 1080p games, but the 3600x and 16gb RAM will be your primary bottlenecks.",want real world experience similar system old pc ryzen x sapphire radeon xt gb gb ram first expect max graphic setting p even fe gb card x fantastic cpu released nearly year old even released budget cpu would double ram asap upgrade cpu ryzen xd soon afford xd socket x need completely swap motherboard reference using old rig could play game like cyberpunk p decent fps medium setting space marine ran fine p lowmedium setting helldivers fine higher end medium setting extra gb vram fe might make small difference high run p game x gb ram primary bottleneck

"I would say keep the new processor and upgrade your mobo and ram, especially since you will most likely upgrade sometime down the road anyways. Then at that point you'd be getting a cpu, mobo, and ram all at once. The new processor will be better plus you'll be getting better ram, so you'll see a difference for sure. And later on when you would be upgrading your cpu anyways you can focus solely on the cpu and maybe the gou at that point. But you'll have 2 upgrades already out of the way. The only things I would really highly recommend for the mobo is make sure the memory clock speed is high enough so that you can enable expo (some mobos I've seen can only support like 4500mhz ram) and also make sure the mobo has a good vrm. The 8500g is a 65 watt cpu so it's not problem finding anything that can handle it. It's mainly for later on when you get a new cpu and say you got a mobo right now and the vrm can only handle a 105 watt cpu, then you want to put a 120 watt cpu in it, you will need to upgrade your mobo AGAIN.

"Upgrading to a Ryzen 5000 (like the 5700X) would provide a good bump in performance over the Ryzen 3600.

* See [these benchmarks from Puget Systems](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/amd-ryzen-5000-series-cpu-review-roundup-1962/) (first chart is for Photoshop) - there's about a 30% increase in performance from the Ryzen 3600XT to the Ryzen 5800X.
* You'd just need to update the BIOS on your motherboard to support the Ryzen 5000 series.

The RAM in your configuration is not optimal - from what I understand, running 3 sticks of RAM means they're running in unoptimized single channel configuration (plus the speeds are not great).  Getting 2x16GB of 3200mhz or 3600mhz RAM would provide a boost, though how much (especially in Photoshop) I do not know.

Blender rendering can leverage Nvidia features for a performance boost, so you would want to stick with Nvidia.  VRAM can be important when rendering large scenes images.  Given that, an upgrade to a video card like the RTX 4070 Super can provide a big increase in rendering speed (though also more expensive).

* [Blender rendering benchmarks from Puget](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/blender-nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-series-performance/) \- the 4070 Ti renders about 123% faster than the 3060 Ti
* [More Blender rendering benchmarks from Puget](https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-40-super-series-content-creation-review/) \- these show the 4070 Super performing about the same as the 4070 Ti.
* One caveat is that you would need to upgrade your power supply to support a more powerful GPU like the 4070 Super.
* If you don't care about speed and aren't having any issues with your 3060 Ti currently, then not necessary to upgrade.

The key is you want a few 100W of extra headroom to allow for any of your parts to pull a bit more than expected if they are under extremely heavy load, and you need to have some headroom no matter what because your parts can have transient power spikes where for very brief fractions of seconds the system will request much more power than it should. If these spikes exceed your PSU limit, the system will shut down

"Just going to add here - everything this guy said is correct, however the answer for OPs budget is probably just the 4080 super or 5080. I totally get the VRAM concerns, but the reality is if they want to use Ray Tracing at 4k at their budget there isn't a better option. The 7900 XTX has better VRAM and faster raster (barely) but it's ray tracing sucks.

The answer is probably to buy a 5080 and rely on the newly enhanced DLSS to upscale from 1440p and use its solid ray tracing performance. There just isn't a better option unless they want to buy a 4090",going add everything guy said correct however answer ops budget probably super totally get vram concern reality want use ray tracing k budget better option xtx better vram faster raster barely ray tracing suck answer probably buy rely newly enhanced dlss upscale p use solid ray tracing performance better option unless want buy

The case you have is great, Lian Li makes some really good cases in my opinion. I have the lancool 216 and its been great and was pretty easy to build in.

"The increased memory is a no brainer at this build price, you want 32GB to make the overall system feel snappier and it will improve performance in some gaming use cases.

Yes, the ryzen 7600x is a newer CPU that on average performs the same as a 12700k but it pulls less watts to do the same work, and it's on a new platform from AMD that is still receiving new generations, the 12th gen Intel platform is long dead. So in the next few years if you want to upgrade the CPU without getting a new motherboard, you can. Ideally you would get a 7600x3D or 7800x3D but the 7600 model is very hard to find these days and the 7800x3D is a bit out of your price range.

If you want a 4070 super just get the cheapest one available, the performance difference between AIB models is very small. Just check what kind of warranties the company provides, that's pretty much all that matters

Low consumption in any load, adding a AMD GPU later on free up the IGPU, so you can use the complete IGPU power for frame generation, which really lifts this one up even more. DGPU will always be able to be fully utilized, as you don't need to use any resources for LS.

IGPU does not suffer from the multi monitor power issue other GPU's have. Running 2 Monitors only requires 3W.

With all this scaling and frame generation getting better and better, the Steam Deck and other Handhelds being favored by a lot of ppl, a lot of games try to fit this market as well. So even though it is not the strongest APU out there, you will still have tons of new games out there that will run perfectly fine just on the IGPU alone.

On top of that, you can use it for any kind of cloud gaming and will have a super efficient unit that consumes way below what a normal setup would require.

Be aware that games are starting to use DX12\_2 though, which will not be supported by the IGPU, to be fair, a 1650 Super doesn't either.

Still this offers roughly 30 years of game development and going for a board like the A520i AC from gigabyte would even offer you a triple monitor setup.

It really depends on your personal preferences and if you are willing to put some effort into managing this system.",still using g without dedicated gpu using since release still pleased either variant still favorite cpuapu even interested exchanging time soon also got lossless scaling around help lot really old game like syberia newer title support kind scaling frame generation low consumption load adding amd gpu later free igpu use complete igpu power frame generation really lift one even dgpu always able fully utilized need use resource l igpu suffer multi monitor power issue gpus running monitor requires w scaling frame generation getting better better steam deck handhelds favored lot ppl lot game try fit market well even though strongest apu still ton new game run perfectly fine igpu alone top use kind cloud gaming super efficient unit consumes way normal setup would require aware game starting use dx though supported igpu fair super either still offer roughly year game development going board like ai ac gigabyte would even offer triple monitor setup really depends personal preference willing put effort managing system

"If you are only using the IGPU, you don't need more than 35W TDP.

To fully max out a RX 6600... you don't need more than 35W TDP.

To keep the temps and consumption down, you can disable CBS in the bios, which would limit the CPU to 3900mhz, there will be no boost to 4600mhz and no PBO.

Even CBS turned of will be enough to max out a RX 6600.

Cores can clock down to 4,35W CPU PPT during system idle. 

Ram Sweet spot for the IGPU is 3600mhz. There is no benefit between cl 16 or 18.

Get at least 32GB of Ram.

32GB enables up to 16GB Vram allocation. Does not hold any mayor benefits in gaming, but would enable certain VRAM size related features in Adobe.

IGPU OC is not really paying off. While you can get more FPS the amount you gain won't change how the games behave.

\- You can get up to 30% more performance in Death Stranding. So it's 33 instead of 30 FPS.

"Good question! The new NVIDIA drivers and DLSS 4 will definitely benefit both the RTX 4060 and 3060 Ti, but there will be a noticeable performance gap. DLSS 4, being the latest version, is optimized to take full advantage of the newer architectures like the 4060, so it might perform better on the 4060 compared to the 3060 Ti.

However, the 30-series cards, including the 3060 Ti, will still receive support for DLSS 4 and the latest drivers. The difference is that they won't be as optimized as the newer cards, but you’ll still see some improvements in performance, especially in titles that utilize DLSS 4 effectively.

"Hey! No worries, it’s might be a corruption issue, but try a simple fix.

1. **Open Disk Management**:
   * Right-click the **Start** button and select **Disk Management**.
   * Look for your 2TB SSD. It should show up as a ""GPT Protective Partition.""
2. **Delete the GPT Protective Partition**:
   * Right-click on the drive (the area that says ""GPT Protective Partition"") and click **Delete Volume**. If you can’t delete it directly, you might need to use Diskpart (next step).
3. **Use Diskpart** (if the partition doesn’t show up in Disk Management):
   * Press **Win + R**, type `cmd`, and press Enter to open the command prompt.
   * Type `diskpart` and hit Enter.
   * Type `list disk` and press Enter. This will show all your connected drives.
   * Find your 2TB drive (it should be listed as a specific number, like ""Disk 1"").
   * Type `select disk 1` (replace ""1"" with the number of your 2TB SSD) and hit Enter.
   * Type `clean` and press Enter to wipe the partition.
   * Then type `convert gpt` to make sure it's GPT formatted.
   * Finally, exit Diskpart with `exit`.
4. **Reformat the Drive**:
   * Go back to Disk Management, right-click the unallocated space on your 2TB SSD, and choose **New Simple Volume**.
   * Follow the prompts to format it.

Once that’s done, it should show up in **Explorer** and be ready for use!

Around 2018 I bought a predator x34 which is 3440x1440. Slightly lower pixel density but a much better panel overall and the extra width was a game changer in many games and even productivity. Performance has never been a major issue as I’ve had almost generational upgrades to top or near top graphics cards so we won’t talk about that aspect. 

I use larger desks with my monitor mounted on an arm or wall so I tend to be 24-30 inches away from the screen so that may be a factor. The further you are the perceived pixel density goes up, that’s why a 4K tv looks fantastic from the couch.

"There’s lots of opinions here, many of them say to see it for yourself in a store before buying, and I agree with that. I will add my own thoughts though:

32” is nicer for immersion over 27”, at any res. Same if watching video.

1440p 27” and 4K 32” are the cheapest and most common screens at those resolutions, probably bc those sizes and resolutions combine really well.

4K takes a lot more GPU to reach a given fps than 1440p. Therefore, 4K may be suboptimal for you IF you prefer playing with graphics quality in games set to max. Ofc if that given fps is relatively low (60) or if you don’t mind lowering some quality settings, then 4K is very reasonable for a 4080/5080-tier card.

IPS vs OLED is it’s own thing, all monitor tech has it’s own disadvantages at present. I went for a 32” 4K IPS (160hz) display and it’s been working great for me, in part bc I wanted more immersion and sharper text than what I had with a 27” 1440p IPS.

I haven’t seen 27” 4K OLED in person, but the dpi is high enough that the color fringing on text probably would be near-invisible. Flicker issues would still be there though.",there lot opinion many say see store buying agree add thought though nicer immersion re watching video p k cheapest common screen resolution probably bc size resolution combine really well k take lot gpu reach given fps p therefore k may suboptimal prefer playing graphic quality game set max ofc given fps relatively low dont mind lowering quality setting k reasonable tier card ip v oled thing monitor tech disadvantage present went k ip hz display working great part bc wanted immersion sharper text p ip havent seen k oled person dpi high enough color fringing text probably would nearinvisible flicker issue would still though

A lot of games, especially modern ones, do not hit 144fps consistently. I run a 3070. It's far from the worst GPU, but it's definitely also not the best for gaming at 4k.


That said, in hindsight, I'd have gotten a 32inch. The pixel density is so high you can't make out individual pixels with ease, hence the clarity. 

But. Because of that, I need to use a 150% display scaling for when I'm working on it. This in turn means I get the same screen real estate (how much you will see on screen) as a 1440p monitor at this size (set to 125%, if I'm not getting my math wrong). It won't impact you if you just game. But it does for UI elements in Windows and programs like Excel. I can get away with 125% but it will be smaller. Some you will also need to force a high DPI override (in Windows on the compatability tab) so everything isn't tiny.",someone k display clarity unbelievable due pixel per inch display hz lot game especially modern one hit fps consistently run far worst gpu definitely also best gaming k said hindsight would gotten inch pixel density high make individual pixel ease hence clarity need use display scaling working turn mean get screen real estate much see screen p monitor size set getting math wrong impact game ui element window program like excel get away smaller also need force high dpi override window compatability tab everything tiny

But the thing I just coudlnt stop getting annoyed by was the colour banding on tiny text. I have as much density on my screen as I can fit with scale and text size etc and thats where I really think 4K makes the difference at 27 inch screen size for me. 

(I dont know if color banding sio the correct term for what I am describing - beause of the scale I set a letter eg 'x' may be 7 pixels tall and cleartype adds other colour pixels to try and smooth it out but those other colour pixels realy stick out like a sore thumb when Im sitting in front of a monitor)

"4k not only gives you really crisp graphics in games, but if you got the eyes for it, it also gives you a lot of desktop real-estate. But that's a bit dependent on how small you like things and what windows scaling option you use.

"So like with most things there is an objective truth for this.

The human eye cant see any more than 300ppi at 12"" which is about the distance a lot of people hold your phone from your face. fun fact 1080p on a 7"" phone at 12 inches away is 312ppi hence why you dont see to many screens with a higher resolution than this.

So this being divisible,  300ppi at 12 inches (1 foot) at 36"" (3 feet) would be devisible by 3 being 100ppi at 3 feet. This means that at 3 feet 100ppi looks exactly the same as 300ppi at 12 inches.

3 feet is the average viewing distance to a desktop screen. Maybe you are closer maybe further so calculator for yourslef. 2 feet would be 150ppi 4 feet would be about 75ppi (equivalents)

4k at 27"" has a PPI of 163 meaning it has the equivalent of over 450ppi at 12"" if you are seeing it from 3 feet away. 1440p at 27"" has a ppi of 108. which at 3 feet away looks like 324ppi.

So the human eye cant see above 300ppi and you have 1440p equivalent of 324 and 4k equivalent at 450 meaning there is 0 difference anyone can see at a viewing distance of 3 feet (again standard of most people who use a desktop)

So the answer is it varies based on your setup. Measure it out, do the math. Keep in mind this is also assuming you have good 20/20 vision which most people dont, the reality is most people probably cant even see 300ppi at 12"" because lets be honest from all of us looking at screens 24/7 most of our eyes are not perfect...

In most cases based on the math alone a 4k 27"" screen would be a waste of money unless you are one of thoes people who sit concerningly close to their displays.",like thing objective truth human eye cant see ppi distance lot people hold phone face fun fact p phone inch away ppi hence dont see many screen higher resolution divisible ppi inch foot foot would devisible ppi foot mean foot ppi look exactly ppi inch foot average viewing distance desktop screen maybe closer maybe calculator yourslef foot would ppi foot would ppi equivalent k ppi meaning equivalent ppi seeing foot away p ppi foot away look like ppi human eye cant see ppi p equivalent k equivalent meaning difference anyone see viewing distance foot standard people use desktop answer varies based setup measure math keep mind also assuming good vision people dont reality people probably cant even see ppi let honest u looking screen eye perfect case based math alone k screen would waste money unless one thoes people sit concerningly close display
"I used a 27"" 4K monitor for 2 years.  I used it for a mix of productivity, and gaming.  I also briefly owned a 32"" 4K monitor, and returned it after a week (unrelated to this question, it was a defect).

I wouldn't say it's a waste, but it wasn't the best choice for gaming.  I often chose to play games at 1440p, simply because the game I was playing didn't have enough fine detail to make a difference.

Some games with lots of text, and other on-screen elements that benefitted from 4K were great.  However, many of the games I play don't.

Personally, I think a 1440p monitor is the better choice for gaming in sizes 27"" to maybe 32"".  Beyond that, I think 4K might be a better choice.

Lots of people will say that 4K at 32"" is ideal, and they're probably right, but honestly I didn't find 4K @ 32"" much better.  I have 20/10 vision (better than 20/20) as of my last eye exam, and I honestly don't see much difference between 1440 and 4K at 32"".  Sure if I look for it, I can see better detail on some things, but it just doesn't do anything for me when it comes to being immersed in a game.  I found myself setting most of my games at 1440p to get more FPS.

Having said all of that, both 27"" and 32"" 4K monitors were terrific for productivity, and I would not hesitate to get either sizes in 4K for productivity work.

That's OLED, like even the modded switch I use to play PC games by streaming them in 4k60 to my switch (1080pdisplay) I actually run it at 2k aka 1440p. Like many will know even on a 1080p screen 2k looks way shaper than 1080p. This combined with very high bitrate makes it look super freaking good on the tiny screen. 

Like no it's not as good as my 48 inch OLED 120 4k, but I had my switch before that screen. The switch legit looked better than my 1440p 160hz Samsung Odyssey just because it's OLED.
Having true blacks makes all the difference in my eyes, same as overall colors are way better. For me the Only screen type HDR actually looks amazing on and still has things that should be nice and vibrant.

"Its not a waste, its just diminishing returns . you are getting less and less bang for the buck as you go towards 4k and 240 hz

You don't NEED any of it  and its exponentially more expensive as you push towards the top end AND like the Corvette, its going to be worth $500 5 years from now

I bought a 7900XTX for 4K high refresh gaming because most of the games that I play the most (FromSoftware titles, path of exile, etc) do not support either upscaling, frame generation, or stuff like that, so I wanted strong raster power that had good drivers on linux.

I bought 4K165Hz and 1440p75Hz 27"" monitors and while I can play most of what I want at +100Hz native in 4K, in hindsight I think that 1440p would have been enough with a 7800xt or 7900xt. If you want to get to +200FPS in some games, mind you that at 4K you will have issues in a lot of games (you may have them even with a 5090) because not all games are optimized enough for such high framerates, or even if you have more than enough GPU, some CPUs will bottleneck you, and in other games that have heavy RT like cyberpunk will struggle to get past 100FPS even with upscaling unless you use frame generation.

"I'm using a 24"" 1080p and 32"" 4k. The 4k looks sharper but honestly the difference isn't that dramatic. For pushing out 4x pixels you definitely don't get a 4x improvement in crispness. The difference gets even smaller in games imo, just feels like I'm playing on a bigger screen and not that there's an enormous difference in resolution... 

I'm in the camp of staying at lower resolutions as long as possible. 4k destroys performance and requires you to upgrade more frequently and spend more in order to keep up. If you get a decent midrange card and stick to 1440/1080p you won't need to upgrade for many years to come. Games don't magically become more fun by running them at higher settings or resolution :).",using p k k look sharper honestly difference dramatic pushing x pixel definitely get x improvement crispness difference get even smaller game imo feel like playing bigger screen enormous difference resolution camp staying lower resolution long possible k destroys performance requires upgrade frequently spend order keep get decent midrange card stick p need upgrade many year come game magically become fun running higher setting resolution

"It could be. OP mentioned a 4k 240hz. If they want to be hitting 240hz, then that may not be possible at 4k (depending on the game, of course), whereas at 1440p, they would have a better chance. They could play at 1440p on the 4k monitor, but from what I've heard most people say, it looks much worse than native 1440p.

The extra money spent on a 4k could go towards a better quality 1440p with better colour accuracy (which could be more important as they mentioned rendering) and better HDR capability, etc.

If you buy a 4k monitor and then have to play at 1440p just to get the refresh rate you want, I'd say that was a waste of money.

I guess it's personal preference, but a 1440p monitor with a better quality screen would personally be a better use of money than a 4k monitor I couldn't actually utilise.

To one person 1440 vs. 4k at 27"" is not very noticeable, but slightly worse colour accuracy could be night and day to them. The opposite is true for other people.

"To be honest, 4k to 1080p or 4k to 1440p is OK if you are using small monitor. Since I used console, I had 4K60Hz 55"" and when downscaling to 1080p it was just the worst experience in PC. Like, because of AMD, I used 24Hz for some months, I thought it was 60Hz, but the GPU put resolution to like 4160p instead of 3840p with the other 36Hz. I moved from RX 7900XT to the RTX 3060ti that came in original computer (I upgraded it) and traded the RX7900XT for Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 12GB RAM.

I think 4k is quite the same as 1440p in 24""\~30"" and not TOO different than 1080p, don't misjudge me, I just wanted to help.

I think for gaming only, a good solution is 1440p240Hz if you playing extreme games. 1080p240Hz is waste, because RTX 5080 is extreme overkill for 1080p, it would reach more than 400fps. For 1440p, 5080 is still overkill, so 5070 is good too... But since you need to render and you want 5080, you might want a monitor with around 240Hz and 1440p.

Yeah but my GPU is running at 95% whilst my CPU is at ~5-8% so upgrading my GPU makes more sense to me.,yeah gpu running whilst cpu upgrading gpu make sense
"Yeah, there’s a good chance prices will drop after the 8000 series comes out, especially for the **RX 7900 XT** and **7800 XT**, since the new GPUs will compete with them. But you’re right—if AMD’s 8000 series doesn’t beat the 7900 XT’s performance, it might not force a massive price drop. You could also see some deals as retailers try to clear out stock to make room for the new cards.

If you're not in a rush, waiting a few weeks after the 8000 series launch could give you better deals, but if you're really looking for a solid upgrade now, the 7900 XT or 7800 XT still offer great performance for the price. It all comes down to how comfortable you are with waiting and potentially seeing a price drop.",yeah there good chance price drop series come especially rx xt xt since new gpus compete youre rightif amd series doesnt beat xt performance might force massive price drop could also see deal retailer try clear stock make room new card rush waiting week series launch could give better deal really looking solid upgrade xt xt still offer great performance price come comfortable waiting potentially seeing price drop

"Hey, my thoughts are:

* **Ryzen 7 9800X3D**: It's an amazing CPU, but it **might** be overkill, depending on your use. For gaming at 1440p and 240Hz, you probably won’t need that much power. The 7800X3D or even a Ryzen 9 7900X would give you killer performance without going too crazy. If you’re also planning on doing heavy multitasking, content creation, or streaming, the 9800X3D could still be worth considering, but for pure gaming, it’s overkill for 1440p.
* **RTX 5080**: That GPU would definitely handle 1440p at 240Hz with no issue, but like the CPU, it might be overkill. For gaming at that resolution, the **RTX 4070 Ti** or **RTX 4080** would give you excellent performance without pushing you too hard on the price. If you want something future-proof, the 4080 is a good gpu, especially for 1440p at high refresh rates.

# Suggested Combo:

* **CPU**: **Ryzen 7 7800X3D** or **Ryzen 9 7900X** (excellent for gaming and 1440p).
* **GPU**: **RTX 4070 Ti** or **RTX 4080** (either will easily handle 1440p at 240Hz).
* **RAM**: You’ve already got great RAM (32GB 6000MHz), which is perfect for gaming and multitasking.",hey thought ryzen xd amazing cpu might overkill depending use gaming p hz probably wont need much power xd even ryzen x would give killer performance without going crazy youre also planning heavy multitasking content creation streaming xd could still worth considering pure gaming overkill p rtx gpu would definitely handle p hz issue like cpu might overkill gaming resolution rtx ti rtx would give excellent performance without pushing hard price want something futureproof good gpu especially p high refresh rate suggested combo cpu ryzen xd ryzen x excellent gaming p gpu rtx ti rtx either easily handle p hz ram youve already got great ram gb mhz perfect gaming multitasking

Another Option would be increasing the settings (higher GPU utilization) or keep it this way. As long as your fps are high enough for you, why upgrade?

I think nowadays windows (or maybe it's even lower down the stack at bios level) can balance load between cores so that one core is not overheated while others don't do anything. Single thread load on 4 thread cpu (just for example) can look like 25% loaded for each core (because load shifts fast enough for task manager to notice).

So, it’s not that the 4060 is *actually* cheaper—it just happens to be priced similarly due to how the local market works. The demand for GPUs here can make prices fluctuate a lot.

"No, you don’t need to cap your monitor's Hz to match your FPS. The monitor's refresh rate (Hz) and your FPS are independent. If your monitor is 500Hz but you're getting 350FPS, the monitor will still display all 350 frames per second. It won’t ""waste"" the extra Hz—it will just refresh more often, ensuring smoother visuals and lower input latency.

In fact, keeping the monitor at its maximum Hz is beneficial because it can still reduce screen tearing and input lag, even if your FPS doesn’t fully reach the refresh rate.

However, if you experience screen tearing and don’t use adaptive sync (like G-Sync or FreeSync), you might want to enable V-Sync or cap your FPS slightly below your maximum frame rate to minimize it.",dont need cap monitor hz match fps monitor refresh rate hz fps independent monitor hz getting fps monitor still display frame per second wont waste extra hzit refresh often ensuring smoother visuals lower input latency fact keeping monitor maximum hz beneficial still reduce screen tearing input lag even fps doesnt fully reach refresh rate however experience screen tearing dont use adaptive sync like gsync freesync might want enable vsync cap fps slightly maximum frame rate minimize

"Hey! This sounds like a memory issue, but lets troubleshoot further.

1. **Memory PMU Training Error** This usually points to a compatibility issue or incorrect memory settings. Here are some steps to try:
   * **Check RAM Compatibility**: Verify that the exact model of your G.Skill Trident Z RAM is on the motherboard's QVL (Qualified Vendor List) for the Asrock B450M Pro4. Ryzen CPUs, especially 3000-series, can be picky about RAM.
   * **Update BIOS**: Ensure the motherboard BIOS is fully updated to the latest version. Newer BIOS versions often improve memory compatibility and PMU training.
2. **Test Default Settings**:
   * Reset BIOS to factory defaults.
   * Disable XMP/DOCP and run the RAM at its base JEDEC speed (e.g., 2133MHz). If the problem disappears, it could be an issue with XMP profiles.
3. **Try Manual RAM Configuration**: If the issue persists, manually configure the RAM settings in BIOS:
   * Set the speed, voltage, and timings manually (use CPU-Z’s SPD tab to find stock timings).
   * Start with a lower frequency (e.g., 3000MHz instead of 3200/3600MHz).
4. **Check CPU Memory Controller**: While you didn’t see any bent pins, it’s possible the IMC (Integrated Memory Controller) on the Ryzen 3900X is struggling with dual-channel. Ryzen memory controllers can be sensitive. Testing your CPU in another motherboard with dual-channel RAM would confirm if it’s a CPU issue.
5. **Test Power Supply**: Insufficient or unstable power delivery can also cause memory instability. Ensure the PSU isn’t the culprit and that all connections (especially the 24-pin and CPU power) are secure.

Start with updating the BIOS and testing the RAM at default speeds. If dual-channel still fails after manual configuration and component swaps, the issue is likely with the 3900X’s IMC, and you might need to RMA the CPU.

"* **Power Needs**: The RTX 5080 is rumored to have **275W TDP**—your 1000W PSU is more than enough, so you're golden there.

"Technically yeah but it's not something I would be super worried about. Most people have their setups sitting on the floor these days so you would never even see a fan failure visually anyway. The most likely way for you to find out would be your CPU getting too hot and thermally throttling itself, it would be very apparent as soon as you tried to play any games with a dead cooler fan and your performance tanked",technically yeah something would super worried people setup sitting floor day would never even see fan failure visually anyway likely way find would cpu getting hot thermally throttling would apparent soon tried play game dead cooler fan performance tanked
So i'ts not something I'm likely to be missing long enough to damage the CPU?,something likely missing long enough damage cpu
"Nah, modern CPUs are really hard to accidentally damage. They will thermally throttle instead, meaning that if they get hot enough they will keep downclocking their performance to create less and less heat, if the heat keeps rising they will just shut off entirely. You would notice bad performance well before even a shutdown, and unless you do that repeatedly there is very little chance of damaging your CPU",nah modern cpu really hard accidentally damage thermally throttle instead meaning get hot enough keep downclocking performance create less less heat heat keep rising shut entirely would notice bad performance well even shutdown unless repeatedly little chance damaging cpu
Just got an idea. How much performance would I lose running a two stack cooler with a single fan in the middle? Like a Thermalright Phantom Spirit 120 EVO with just the middle fan? Because it would solve the ram issue and if it runs better than a single stack with two fans it leaves space for improvement if I decide to upgrade the RAM.,got idea much performance would lose running two stack cooler single fan middle like thermalright phantom spirit evo middle fan would solve ram issue run better single stack two fan leaf space improvement decide upgrade ram
"I'm honestly not sure, you would have to look it up to see if anyone has documented it before, I'm sure somebody has to have tried it before but I've never seen anything about it.

The single fan might have a hard time pulling air through one fin stack while pushing air through the other one, so it might get loud if the fan ramps up hard. But it's still double the fins, so I assume it would be better than a single fin stack setup? Genuinely not sure",honestly sure would look see anyone documented sure somebody tried never seen anything single fan might hard time pulling air one fin stack pushing air one might get loud fan ramp hard still double fin assume would better single fin stack setup genuinely sure

The testing aside, the main benefits of the 5700x3D would require a powerful GPU to really work out. Also, if the game does not benefit from the l3 Cache, it only comes down to raw CPU and GPU performance where the FPS end up. If you run into a GPU limit, you won't magically generate more frames with X3d.

If you are running a lower end or low mid tier card, you won't have as much uplift as you think. It is a different story with a 4090 like in most tests... but the potential of a hardware part is pretty much wasted, if you don't have the power to back it up.

This would be a comparison, with a 3080. Depending on what you are actually playing... It might neither be worth the risk nor the upgrade.

"I am assuming you are limiting AI access to single user per PC at any given time.

Inferencing is basically not impacted by lower PCI-E speed, only the initial model loading onto VRAM will take a little longer.

Reason is, all heavy calculation is done on the GPU, and GPU doesn't transfer data until it is finished -- and the resulting work is just text. So reduced PCI-E bandwidth makes no real difference. Even with tensor parallelism, only text data flows back and forth, so lower PCI-E bandwidth once again, doesn't make a huge difference.

So, if you check out r/LocalLLaMA subreddit or other similar subreddits, you can find people using extremely old used Xeon setups that costs pennies (comparably). You do not have to be so focused on dual 16x or anything like that. Just make sure board spaced out PCI-E 16x slots so that your choice of GPUs can fit on it.

You also do need to buy high end PSUs, and recommending a big tower. I recommend at least 1200W. 1200W and above will have enough connectors for 2x 3090. Double check as some 3090 requires 3x cables instead of 2x. It also helps if you go with 3090 FE.

Also... while you don't need a lot of RAM, you should still try to get at least 32 GB.

Such setup will run about $2500ish per PC (used 3090 Ti refurbished is $800 from MicroCenter, so if it's just 3090, should be a little cheaper).

As for professional setup -- you'd do this if you want to allow multiple students to access AI at the same time, but doing so means you'll be purchasing expensive server hardware with multiple PCI-E slots + nVidia's professional lineups like RTX Ada cards. These would run over ten thousand dollars...",assuming limiting ai access single user per pc given time inferencing basically impacted lower pcie speed initial model loading onto vram take little longer reason heavy calculation done gpu gpu transfer data finished resulting work text reduced pcie bandwidth make real difference even tensor parallelism text data flow back forth lower pcie bandwidth make huge difference check rlocalllama subreddit similar subreddits find people using extremely old used xeon setup cost penny comparably focused dual x anything like make sure board spaced pcie x slot choice gpus fit also need buy high end psus recommending big tower recommend least w w enough connector x double check requires x cable instead x also help go fe also need lot ram still try get least gb setup run ish per pc used ti refurbished microcenter little cheaper professional setup would want allow multiple student access ai time mean purchasing expensive server hardware multiple pcie slot nvidias professional lineup like rtx ada card would run ten thousand dollar

"You don't need to force anything in bios. Pcie standard is backwards compatible, you can put a gen3 nvme SSD into a gen5 slot and it'll just run at gen3 speeds.

I'll be honest, you won't notice the difference between gen4 or gen5 in normal use, be it the SSD or your GPU. Losses going from gen5 to gen4 on the 5090 are basically negligible within margin of error. Those kinda bandwidths and speeds won't be fully utilized for a long while yet.

Same on the SSD, unless you're routinely working on large files all the time, that gen5 speed will not be felt.

Edit: read up on the 4.0 riser <-> 5.0 slot issue, sounds similar to what was going on with the 3.0/4.0 transition.
I'd just wait for a 5.0 riser to come out, that shouldn't have issues. The problem happens because the slot is 5.0 while the riser isn't. I guess forcing the slot into 4.0 mode would avoid that issue too, yes. I don't think bios settings let you be so specific as to only downgrade that one slot into 4.0, so it'd be global probably.

"Hello and welcome!

The easiest and most common upgrade in your case is to upgrade the CPU to a Ryzen 5 5700X3D. It will be a significant boost to your computer.

Secondly, the 1070ti is reaching end-of-life. This is more expensive to replace, as GPU prices have gone crazy. If sticking with Nvidia, you'd want to upgrade to at least an RTX 3070, if not a 4070, but 4070s are expensive. I would personally recommend avoiding the 4060-tier GPUs and below.

If you wish to switch to AMD, you can find good value at the RX 7700 or RX 7800 levels. If you switch from Nvidia to AMD, you'll need to run a piece of software called DDU, which will flush out all the Nvidia drivers for you that stay behind and cause problems for AMD video cards (and vice versa if switching from AMD to Nvidia).

RAM can easily be upgraded later on to 32GB. That's not a priority, but a nice to have at some point after first priorities are completed.

Storage: If you're running near full on your SSDs, that can effect your performance. Clear space by deleting old games/files, or buy a 2nd SSD to install for more space.",hello welcome easiest common upgrade case upgrade cpu ryzen xd significant boost computer secondly ti reaching endoflife expensive replace gpu price gone crazy sticking nvidia would want upgrade least rtx expensive would personally recommend avoiding tier gpus wish switch amd find good value rx rx level switch nvidia amd need run piece software called ddu flush nvidia driver stay behind cause problem amd video card vice versa switching amd nvidia ram easily upgraded later gb thats priority nice point first priority completed storage running near full ssds effect performance clear space deleting old gamesfiles buy nd ssd install space
"There’s a few routes you can go. For one, if you want to stay on the same motherboard, get either a 5500/5600 new or a 5700X3D new from AliExpress (make sure it’s a reputable seller with lots of reviews also it doesn’t include cooler fyi). Upgrade your GPU to a used Radeon RX 6700/6750 XT 12GB VRAM or a 7800XT if you want 16GB VRAM (you could try for Nvidia’s GPUs too but you’ll be spending more price per performance). Likewise your RAM is decent (so long as the speed is good but maybe buy another 16GB to be a little safer though not entirely necessary). Depending on your configuration (i.e. 1 stick of 16GB or 2 sticks of 8GB just go with what’s already there and don’t mix them). Definitely upgrade that storage. 100GB is barely anything for one and two, the price per GB now is crazy. You can go with a standard SSD or if you have an NVME M.2 SSD slot go with one of those. Though they do run hot so you could either buy a heatsink for it (they’re cheap), check if your motherboard already has a heatsink, or just use the sticker/label it has as a heatsink (not optimal but not the worst). Lastly, and this is a big one: PSU is maybe the most important/least thought about component of a build. Do not settle for whatever. Look up reviews. If you have one in there that seems good already, great. But still research before putting anything you don’t want fried in there. And do make sure that it’s total wattage is more than the rest of your components. Also the most expensive doesn’t equal best. And the 80+ ratings can be misleading sometimes.

"I am old, I have gone through a lot of these generation launches.

Here is my observation:

There is always some dumbass leading out to launch explaining with much gusto how he/she is waiting on the launch of the new generation to buy the old generation at a pricebreak.

The logic looks sound.  It always looks sound.  I mean, ebay, right?

You need to understand what is really going on.

The card manufacturers are NOT making the old gen up to the last minute.   They stopped making the old gen higher edition cards a while ago and swapped over to the new stuff, they are playing a game with stock.  What they want is for stock to be depleted right before the launch.

So the idea you can walk into a BestBuy and get a discounted 4070 cause they want to deplete stock is something Nvidia and AMD are actively trying to avoid.

MEANWHILE....

The other trick you think should be happening is that people are replacing last year's card with this years card and selling at a discount.

It never goes that way.  Go out to ebay and look at prices.  This bit I have never completly understood, but the truth is undeniable.  The discount you want isn't really there.

MEANWHILE ON STORE SHELVES....

Scalpers are grabbing up inventory as quickly as they can find it.

My advice for GPU buying isn't really hard.

Figure out what you want.  Look at MFSRP and use that as a budget.  Put that money away and don't touch it.

Be ready to pounce when you see it.  But be patient.

"Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and hopefully fix the issue:

Check Connections:

Make sure all power cables are connected tight, especially the 24-pin ATX and 8-pin CPU connectors.
Double-check that the GPU is firmly in the PCIe slot and that its power cables are plugged in.

Monitor and Cable Check:

Ensure the monitor is on and set to the right input (like HDMI or DisplayPort).
Try a different cable or use another port on the GPU and monitor.

Clear CMOS:

Turn off the power supply and unplug it.
Find the CMOS battery on the motherboard, take it out for a few minutes, then put it back in.
You can also use the ""Clear CMOS"" jumper if your board has one.

BIOS Update:

Make sure you’re following the right steps for flashing the BIOS. The USB drive needs to be FAT32 formatted, and the BIOS file should be named correctly as per MSI's instructions.
If the BIOS flash doesn’t work, try a different USB drive.

Single RAM Stick:

Boot up with just one stick of RAM and test each slot to check for bad RAM or a faulty slot.

Check for Motherboard Debug LEDs:

Many motherboards have debug LEDs that show which part might be having trouble (like CPU, DRAM, VGA, Boot).

Reseat Components:

Take out and reinsert parts like RAM, CPU (watch for bent pins), and GPU.

Test with Minimal Configuration:

Unplug everything that’s not essential for booting (extra drives, peripherals). Just use the CPU, one stick of RAM, GPU, and boot drive.

Test Components:

If you can, test your parts in another system to rule out hardware problems (especially GPU and RAM).

Contact Support:

If nothing works, think about reaching out to MSI support or taking your setup to a pro for help.",step help troubleshoot hopefully fix issue check connection make sure power cable connected tight especially pin atx pin cpu connector doublecheck gpu firmly pcie slot power cable plugged monitor cable check ensure monitor set right input like hdmi displayport try different cable use another port gpu monitor clear cmos turn power supply unplug find cmos battery motherboard take minute put back also use clear cmos jumper board one bios update make sure youre following right step flashing bios usb drive need fat formatted bios file named correctly per msis instruction bios flash doesnt work try different usb drive single ram stick boot one stick ram test slot check bad ram faulty slot check motherboard debug led many motherboards debug led show part might trouble like cpu dram vga boot reseat component take reinsert part like ram cpu watch bent pin gpu test minimal configuration unplug everything thats essential booting extra drive peripheral use cpu one stick ram gpu boot drive test component test part another system rule hardware problem especially gpu ram contact support nothing work think reaching msi support taking setup pro help

Motherboard: - ASUS TUF B550M-Plus: This Micro ATX board supports PCIe 4.0, which is great for your new GPU. It’s compact and works well in small cases. - MSI B550 Tomahawk: Another solid choice with PCIe 4.0 support and good overall performance.

Power Supply: - Cooler Master MWE Gold 750 V2: This is a fully modular 80 Plus Gold certified power supply with 750W.

"> It has an integrated GPU which I have ordered a replacement for (Geforce GT 710)

Oh dear. You won't be playing anything decent with that GPU. It can barely keep pace with Intel integrated GPUs from five years ago, was dropped from driver support about four years ago, and was a joke when it came out over *nine* years ago. You can find a better GPU for free if you ask someone nicely. I wouldn't go any lower than a GTX 750 Ti (which is a Maxwell GPU from the GTX 900 series, unintuitively) if you want to have *any* hope of using the GPU to do GPU things.

The GT 710 and any CPU you put in an H61 motherboard will not need anywhere near the 381 watts Newegg's power supply calculator is estimating; you can probably run it all off a 150W PicoPSU.

"> Most of the ones I'm looking at (This one for instance) have a fan on top of the PSU which to me seems like it would be a problem for this case, and a question I have for you all is: can I like, flip it upside down?

Yes.  Pretty much all cases with top-mounted power supplies assume the power supply fan is facing down.

The issue you *might* have is whether that uses a standard ATX power supply.  However, as the system is over a decade old, there is very little information on it.  You'll have to look at the power supply label to see whether it mentions an ATX standard.  It's good if it does.

It's also worth checking the dimensions of the current power supply (specifically the side where the wall cable plugs in) in case it's some weird form factor.

> Also should I consider a CPU upgrade in the future?

Frankly I wouldn't trust that power supply to drive an electric toothbrush. I'm rereading the very sparse information on that PC and it might actually be a standard ATX power supply, which opens up options a lot. However for power supply I would not go any lower than the MSI A550BN for a modern unit; Thermaltake's power supplies are garbage up and down the line.

With that in mind, and since we can drive the GPU with a stronger power supply, you could consider a more modern GPU, if budget permits - since the 750 Ti is likely to be dropped from driver support soon and isn't very powerful by any modern standard.",ti along gb ram would work even w power supply would definitely melt explode realistically power frankly would trust power supply drive electric toothbrush rereading sparse information pc might actually standard atx power supply open option lot however power supply would go lower msi abn modern unit thermaltakes power supply garbage line mind since drive gpu stronger power supply could consider modern gpu budget permit since ti likely dropped driver support soon powerful modern standard

"Not necessarily because there is not as much of an incentive to increase to a higher 30 series card, and would be better to upgrade to a 40 series card, but with the 40 series shortage the new and used market for 40 series is going up higher than the demand for 30 series cards, meaning my 3060Ti is still worth around $220 used but even a used 40 series card is upwards $300+ easily. And again as I said in my post I don't have the funds to upgrade for a while. Besides my original question is if overclocking the CPU is worth it, not my graphics card.",necessarily much incentive increase higher series card would better upgrade series card series shortage new used market series going higher demand series card meaning ti still worth around used even used series card upwards easily said post fund upgrade besides original question overclocking cpu worth graphic card
"Overclocking anything you own will do nothing special.

Your 3060 Ti is worth up to $275 to $300 if you play your cards right.",overclocking anything nothing special ti worth play card right
What cooler are you using? I can understand wanting it to run cooler but you're not in the danger zone.,cooler using understand wanting run cooler danger zone
"Nope.  The 5800x3D aren't really available any more, get a 5700x3D.  Even they are starting to get a bit scarce.  Should get you another year at least.",nope xd really available get xd even starting get bit scarce get another year least
"The first rule of PC building is that you don't upgrade anything. You start a new build from scratch, and future-proof it with the ***intention*** of upgrading.

"This, totally agreed. Especially now we are leveraging pcie lanes and resizable bars more than ever before.

"Not the 8700G, it sucks

The 9600X is a good choice for the right price

The 7500F/7600/7600X are usually quite a bit cheaper and only little slower than the 9600X, so they're very worth looking into",g suck x good choice right price fx usually quite bit cheaper little slower x worth looking

Buy DDR5-6000 CL30 RAM instead,buy ddr cl ram instead
The small form factor will do more to increase heat and noise then getting a 7600x. All of the things you want are pretty hard fo do with a small form factor especially if this is the first pc build. To have a cool and quite PC you need air flow which like I said is very challenging in a small form factor. 4070ti will also put out a good amount of heat especially in a low air flow situation. Quiet means low fan rpm which probably wont happen because you will need a higher fan RPM to pump enough air to cool that system. ATX mid towers are not really that big IMO and would make it exponentially easier to accomplish what you want. Also you will want CL30 ram instead of CL36.,small form factor increase heat noise getting x thing want pretty hard fo small form factor especially first pc build cool quite pc need air flow like said challenging small form factor ti also put good amount heat especially low air flow situation quiet mean low fan rpm probably wont happen need higher fan rpm pump enough air cool system atx mid tower really big imo would make exponentially easier accomplish want also want cl ram instead cl
Ok TIL about CL terminology in ram. Whats the difference between CL30 and i guess the CL36 is my build?,ok til cl terminology ram whats difference cl guess cl build
Small form factor is the part where i cant budge on Unfortunately with my limited space. I know small form factor is prone to higher temps and such but ideally im trying to get this thing relatively quiet by choosing parts that dont require too much power and are easy to cool. Im not trying to render big projects or anything just game and browse the internet For the most part,small form factor part cant budge unfortunately limited space know small form factor prone higher temp ideally im trying get thing relatively quiet choosing part dont require much power easy cool im trying render big project anything game browse internet part
CL30 is faster.,cl faster
If you want less heat the first part to down grade is the GPU. That is a pretty hot card at 285W TDP. A 4070 would be close to half that at 160W. 7600 is about 40W less TDP than a 7600x but I would rather have the X. Also the RAM you have listed wont even work for the either of those CPUs. Max speed for both of those CPUs is 5200MT/s. If small form factor is a must you will have to compromise on the noise and heat. It won't thermal throttle but it certainly will heat the room and will definitely not be silent.,want less heat first part grade gpu pretty hot card w tdp would close half w w less tdp x would rather x also ram listed wont even work either cpu max speed cpu mt small form factor must compromise noise heat thermal throttle certainly heat room definitely silent
7600x and non x only supports up to 5200 MT/s,x non x support mt
Gotcha lower is faster. Ill change out the ram then.,gotcha lower faster ill change ram
"Ah good call on the ram. I didnt consider max speed from cpu. 

the power draw on the 4070 ti super did concern me. It seemed like a pretty big jump. Wanted to have a little future proof for games down the line. Maybe a 4070 super may be better option?",ah good call ram didnt consider max speed cpu power draw ti super concern seemed like pretty big jump wanted little future proof game line maybe super may better option
"Officially, yes, but basically all 7000 series CPUs allow you to overclock the RAM to 6000 MT/s. AMD even does their testing and official benchmark data at that speed.",officially yes basically series cpu allow overclock ram mt amd even testing official benchmark data speed
4070 is for temps. Not for future proof. Those are on the opposite sides of the spectrum. 4070 is a solid mid range card but yes the 4070ti is better.,temp future proof opposite side spectrum solid mid range card yes ti better
