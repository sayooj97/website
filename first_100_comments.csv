without knowing least cpu case current cooler temp really say best nhd good enough cpu thermalright phantom spirit would even cheaper similar performance air cooling
building new pc get aio existing pc get air cooler aios come fan usually buy additional fan
already sufficient cooler would waste could go towards gpu upgrade really want swap tinker cpu guess would go artic one
post updated k okinos cypress case full mm aio support top front case well air cooler clearance mm height dimension nhd
currently fan top pc aio would go fan come aio would go top radiator
air cooler barely sufficient start oc want definitely sufficient
xd maxed cpu cover gpu least
seeing ubm wonder would good option
ah multi time day question mixing kit shape form bad idea worst case scenario complete system boot failure
use brand size ram stick together mix match wont work somehow ram speed size slowestsmallest system also dont place right next leave one space free ram stick unless enough ram fill slot look motherboard manual confirmation usually closest cpu third cpu two ram stick tldr remove old gb stick replace new gb stick leave one slot free new one edit put new ram stick pc might take couple minute start first time ram stick trained first time everything start quick
